Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, the antioxidant effects of alpha-lipoic acid might alter the effectiveness of alkylating agents. The use of antioxidants like alpha-lipoic acid during chemotherapy is controversial. There are concerns that antioxidants could reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals ( 391 ). However, some researchers theorize that antioxidants might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that might interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells ( 14012 , 14013 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, antioxidants such as alpha-lipoic acid have on chemotherapy. Advise patients to consult their oncologist before using alpha-lipoic acid. more ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, alpha-lipoic acid may have antiplatelet effects and may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. In vitro, alpha-lipoic acid inhibits platelet aggregation ( 98682 ). more ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, taking alpha-lipoic acid with antidiabetes drugs might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Although some small clinical studies have suggested that alpha-lipoic acid can lower blood glucose levels ( 3545 , 3874 , 3875 , 3876 , 20490 , 20493 , 104650 ), larger clinical studies in patients with diabetes have shown no clinically meaningful effect ( 20494 , 20495 , 20496 , 90443 , 90445 , 110118 ). Additionally, co-administration of single doses of alpha-lipoic acid and glyburide or acarbose did not cause detectable drug interactions in healthy volunteers ( 3870 ). more ANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, the antioxidant effects of alpha-lipoic acid might alter the effectiveness of antitumor antibiotics. The use of antioxidants like alpha-lipoic acid during chemotherapy is controversial. There are concerns that antioxidants could reduce the activity of antitumor antibiotic drugs, which work by generating free radicals ( 391 ). However, some researchers theorize that antioxidants might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that might interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells ( 14012 , 14013 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, antioxidants such as alpha-lipoic acid have on chemotherapy involving antitumor antibiotics. Advise patients to consult their oncologist before using alpha-lipoic acid. more THYROID HORMONE Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, alpha-lipoic acid might decrease the effects of thyroid hormone drugs. Animal research suggests that co-administration of thyroxine with alpha-lipoic acid reduces conversion into the active T3 form ( 8946 ). more</data><data key="mechanism_text">General Alpha-lipoic acid is about 30% absorbed from dietary or supplemental sources, and is reduced to dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) in many tissues ( 1561 , 3871 , 3872 ). Endogenous alpha-lipoic acid is a coenzyme that, together with pyrophosphatase, is involved in carbohydrate metabolism and in the mitochondrial citric acid cycle which produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ( 12021 , 107893 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Alpha-lipoic acid is a modulator of the inflammatory response and may suppress vascular inflammation ( 12021 , 16391 , 103327 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been shown to increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with multiple sclerosis when administered at a dose of 1200 mg ( 30892 ). Increased cAMP is believed to decrease inflammation and apoptosis. Also, taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily has been shown to reduce levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 in obese patients ( 21657 , 103330 ). In addition, negative correlations between insulin sensitivity index and levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 have been noted in obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance ( 21657 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research in various patient populations shows that taking oral alpha lipoic acid 300-1200 mg for 1-48 weeks reduces levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha when compared with placebo ( 107894 ). Although some research disagrees, alpha-lipoic acid also appears to reduce levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in human research ( 14010 , 104650 , 107889 , 107894 , 101867 , 115744 ). In vitro evidence shows that alpha-lipoic acid strongly suppresses proinflammatory TNF-alpha and IL-1beta-induced fractalkine expression in endothelial cells by suppressing the activities of nuclear factor-kappaB and specificity protein-1 ( 30826 ). Clinical research in females who have not delivered after an episode of preterm labor shows that alpha-lipoic acid increases the presence of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in the cervical fluid but does not alter the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( 96226 ). Alpha-lipoic acid also inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced monocyte activation and acute inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo by activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway ( 30842 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to be an endogenous regulator of secretory phospholipase (PL) A2 enzyme activity and suppress inflammatory reactions ( 30838 ). Antineoplastic effects Alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to induce apoptosis in human colon cancer cells in vitro by increasing mitochondrial respiration ( 30818 ). Antioxidant effects Exogenous alpha-lipoic acid, and the metabolite DHLA, have antioxidant activity and can scavenge free radicals both intra- and extracellularly ( 3871 , 30922 ). Alpha-lipoic acid is both water and fat soluble and can regenerate endogenous antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, and glutathione, and prevent oxidative damage ( 1547 , 1550 , 3546 , 3871 , 3885 , 30788 , 30916 , 30919 , 30923 , 30926 )( 30935 , 30936 , 30937 ). Preliminary data suggests that these antioxidant effects might provide protection in cerebral ischemia, excitotoxic amino acid brain injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, hypoxia-reoxygenation, muscle ischemia associated with peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, and other causes of damage to brain or neural tissue ( 1561 , 3546 , 3871 , 3877 , 10148 , 16391 , 30789 , 30847 , 30924 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has shown promise in experimental models to prevent aminoglycoside-induced cochlear damage, and metal (lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury) and chemical (hexachlorobenzene, n-hexane) poisoning ( 3871 , 3879 , 3881 , 3882 , 3883 , 3884 , 30921 ). Children treated with alpha-lipoic acid, alone or in combination with vitamin E, showed normalized organ function and lessened indices of oxidative damage following radiation exposure in the Chernobyl accident ( 3871 ). The antioxidant effects of alpha-lipoic acid might be beneficial in conditions in which oxidative stress is a factor, although effects may differ for each patient population ( 3879 , 107888 , 107889 , 107891 , 111306 ). A meta-analysis and other clinical research in adults with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 300-600 mg daily in combination with valsartan 80 mg and/or amlodipine daily for 14 days improves total antioxidant capacity and reduces levels of oxidative stress markers, such as superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde, when compared with valsartan or alpha-lipoic acid alone ( 107891 , 111306 ). A small, crossover study in patients with beta-thalassemia receiving standard iron chelation therapy shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 8 weeks may decrease serum levels of malondialdehyde when compared with placebo, with no effect on total antioxidant capacity ( 107888 ). Clinical research in non-menopausal females with episodic migraines without aura shows that taking oral alpha lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily before lunch and dinner for 3 months reduces levels of serum malondialdehyde, but does not affect total antioxidant capacity, glutathione, total antioxidant status, or oxidative stress index, when compared with placebo ( 107889 ). Antiplatelet activity Clinical research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid inhibits platelet aggregation in adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy after 12 weeks ( 115872 ). Antiviral effects Preliminary data suggests that alpha-lipoic acid can inhibit replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by inhibiting reverse transcriptase ( 1280 , 3871 ). Reactive oxygen species may act as intracellular messengers for HIV gene expression and transcription, and the antioxidant effects of alpha-lipoic acid could inhibit this process ( 1562 , 1563 ). Alpha-lipoic acid supplementation might improve blood antioxidant status and blood peroxidation products, and increase T-helper lymphocytes and T-helper to T-helper suppressor cell ratio, based on a small open trial in HIV positive patients ( 3885 ). In vitro, lipoic acid reduced the growth of Vaccinia virus by inhibiting the expression of late genes ( 30862 ). Cardiovascular effects Preliminary evidence suggests that the alpha-lipoic acid metabolite, DHLA, in combination with vitamin E might prevent oxidative stress in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury ( 3871 , 3877 ). In addition, alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and possibly triglycerides ( 100709 , 104650 , 115744 ). Also, ex vivo research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid decreases platelet reactivity in patients with type 1 diabetes, which may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease in these patients ( 30912 ). However, in patients with beta-thalassemia, taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily does not seem to modify most of the cardiovascular risk factors measured, including homocysteine and trimethylamine-N-oxide. The effects on plasma lipids in this group of patients is not known ( 103329 ). Chelating effects Alpha-lipoic acid and DHLA have been shown to chelate heavy metals ( 30843 ). In animal research, alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to increase the hepatobiliary excretion of an organic mercury by forming a stable complex ( 30819 ). Endocrine effects In human research, alpha-lipoic acid improved steady state plasma insulin, glucose infusion rate, and insulin sensitivity ( 3545 , 3876 , 21657 , 30840 , 30863 , 30941 , 104660 ). In animal research, alpha-lipoic acid restored endoneurial glucose storage ( 3878 ), appeared to prevent diabetic endothelial damage, and reduced albuminuria due to its antioxidative properties ( 30791 , 30796 , 30935 ). In additional animal research, alpha-lipoic acid improved muscle regeneration and aided in the redistribution of muscle fibers by stimulating glycolysis through the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, which is impaired in diabetes ( 96230 ). In laboratory research, alpha-lipoic acid increased the overall glucose uptake by stimulating glucose transport via the insulin signaling pathway ( 3544 , 3875 , 3876 , 30793 , 30797 , 30931 , 30933 , 30934 , 30950 , 96230 ). Alpha-lipoic acid contains high-energy bonds and functions as a coenzyme with pyrophosphate in the conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl-coenzyme A (Krebs cycle). As a cofactor in enzyme complexes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-ketoacids, alpha-lipoic acid decreases lactate and pyruvate concentrations, thus improving glucose effectiveness ( 3545 , 3544 ). DHLA also appears to prevent serum albumin glycation in vitro ( 30928 ), as well as hemoglobin glycation and lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes ( 30794 ). Immunologic effects The addition of alpha-lipoic acid to peripheral blood mononuclear cells of cancer patients significantly enhanced progression of the cells through the G0/G1 to S phase, suggesting that alpha-lipoic acid may help restore the immune system in these patients ( 30802 ). Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that alpha-lipoic acid improves functional reactivity of lymphocytes to T-cell mitogens in HIV patients who previously failed antiretroviral treatment (HAART) ( 21655 ). Metabolic effects Case reports indicate that alpha-lipoic acid may be helpful in various inborn errors of metabolism which result in lactic acidosis ( 1554 , 1555 , 1557 ). Neurological effects In some animal research, alpha-lipoic acid scavenged very-long-chain fatty acid-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in reduced oxidative stress to proteins, axonal degeneration, and locomotor impairment ( 30902 ). Other animal research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid prevents nerve dysfunction by attenuating the oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia in diabetic rats ( 30885 ). In experimental diabetic models, alpha-lipoic acid increases neuronal blood flow, improves neuronal glucose uptake, increases amounts of reduced glutathione in neurons, and improves neuronal conduction velocity ( 3873 , 3878 ). Alpha-lipoic acid may be beneficial in neuropathic pain due to decreased nociceptive sensitivity, via inhibition of T-type calcium channels ( 112940 ). Osteoporosis effects In vitro evidence suggests that alpha-lipoic acid suppresses the development of osteoclasts, bone cells that resorb bone tissue, by directly inhibiting RANKL-RANK mediated signals, not by mediating cellular RANKL (kappaB ligand) production ( 30822 ). Other in vitro evidence suggests that alpha-lipoic acid inhibits TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in human bone marrow stromal cells, which may attenuate bone loss ( 30824 ). Vascular effects Clinical research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid can improve flow-mediated dilation ( 21656 , 30715 , 30851 , 30881 , 30884 , 30896 ). Animal research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid can partially restore the decline in endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity that is associated with vascular dysfunction in the elderly ( 30807 ). Other animal research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid improves endothelial dysfunction in obese rats by activating AMP-activated protein kinase in endothelial cells ( 30827 ). In vitro research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid downregulates proteins upregulated by and upregulates certain proteins downregulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in vascular smooth muscle cells ( 30810 ). TNF-alpha is believed to regulate cellular functions associated with the initiation and progression of vascular lesions; by attenuating the effects of TNF-alpha, alpha-lipoic acid may reduce the development of atherosclerosis. Weight loss effects In general, clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid reduces levels of leptin and increases levels of adiponectin in patients with excess adiposity. A dysregulation in the levels of these adipocytokines in adipose tissue is thought to play a role in the development of chronic disease, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ( 103331 , 104660 ). Additionally, clinical research shows that the application of an alpha-lipoic acid transdermal patch reduces triceps skinfold and subcutaneous fat thickness ( 115874 ). In an animal model, alpha-lipoic acid (0.5% weight/weight) reduces body weight and food intake. Alpha-lipoic acid also increases whole-body energy expenditure. It appears to exert its effects by suppressing hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase ( 30814 ). Wound-healing effects According to human research, the mechanisms of action behind the wound-healing effects of alpha-lipoic acid may include antioxidant effects ( 21677 ), inhibition of expression of genes for metalloproteinases, and increased expression of genes for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-beta, b-FGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, and IL-6 ( 21676 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Possibly Safe</data><data key="overview_text">Alpha-lipoic acid is an antioxidant compound that is produced naturally in the body. It can also be obtained via dietary sources such as red meat, organ meats, spinach, broccoli, potatoes, yams, carrots, beets, and yeast</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Diabetic neuropathy. Oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg daily seems to improve symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in patients with diabetes. Its benefits in patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy are unclear. Several clinical studies show that taking alpha-lipoic acid, either alone or in combination with gamma-lipoic acid, superoxide dismutase, or vitamin B12, seems to improve neuropathic sensory symptoms such as burning, pain, numbness, and prickling of the feet and legs, as well as objective measures such as ratings of neurological deficit and disability. Symptom improvement seems to occur within 3 to 5 weeks of oral or intravenous dosing ( 3540 , 3541 , 3557 , 3868 , 10148 , 12106 , 20473 , 20475 , 20478 , 20480 )( 20481 , 20484 , 20488 , 90447 , 103333 , 111429 , 111703 , 113894 ). A meta-analysis of 10 clinical studies in adults with diabetic polyneuropathy shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg daily for 3 weeks to 2 years reduces the incidence, severity, and frequency of sensory symptoms and improves measures of impairment and neurological disability but does not improve vibration perception threshold or measures of nerve conduction when compared with placebo ( 111703 ). Additionally, a similar meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily improves neuropathy symptoms as assessed with the Total Symptom Score (TSS) when compared with placebo ( 113894 ). However, another meta-analysis of 6 studies in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes, that includes some of the same studies, shows that giving alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg daily orally or intravenously for 3-8 weeks does not improve neuropathic pain when compared with placebo ( 112937 ). Likewise, a Cochrane systematic review of 3 clinical studies in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes shows that alpha-lipoic acid given intravenously and orally has little to no benefit on neuropathy symptoms after 6 months as assessed with the TSS or on impairment as assessed with the Neuropathy Impairment Score-Lower Limbs when compared with placebo ( 113897 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in conjunction with other treatments for diabetic neuropathy. Meta-analyses of 2-9 clinical studies in patients with diabetic neuropathy shows that intravenous alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily in combination with vitamin B12 and epalrestat for 3-8 weeks improves sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity and vibration perception thresholds in the lower limbs when compared with control groups receiving either conventional therapy or the vitamin B12 and epalrestat combination alone ( 113896 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, all studies were conducted in China and so it is unclear if results can be extrapolated to other geographic regions and populations. Across the various studies, alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg taken by mouth daily in one to three divided doses has been used ( 3540 , 3541 , 3868 , 20475 , 20478 , 103333 , 111429 , 113897 ). A specific combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg and superoxide dismutase 140 IU (ALA600 SOD, Alfa Wassermann) has also been used ( 20488 ). Intravenously, alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg and 1200 mg daily have been used ( 3540 , 3541 , 3557 , 10148 , 20480 , 20481 , 20484 , 113897 ). In one study, a specific product (Thiotacid, Eva Pharma) was used ( 103333 ). However, some preliminary clinical research shows that lower doses of alpha-lipoic acid are ineffective for improving nerve conduction velocity or subjective complaints of neuropathy ( 3869 , 20479 , 20482 , 20486 , 20487 ). Also, although there is some preliminary evidence that taking alpha-lipoic acid improves nerve function indices, such as Valsalva maneuver, Ewing's tests, or electrocardiogram measurements in patients with a specific type of diabetic neuropathy called cardiac autonomic neuropathy, taking alpha-lipoic acid orally does not improve clinical symptoms ( 3542 , 20483 , 20485 , 96223 , 107892 ). more Hyperlipidemia. Oral alpha-lipoic acid seems to reduce levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in certain populations. However, it is unclear whether alpha-lipoic acid is clinically beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia. A meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-1200 mg daily for up to 16 weeks decreases total cholesterol by 10 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol by 9 mg/dL, but does not seem to improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglycerides, when compared with placebo ( 100709 ). Another meta-analysis of clinical research in various patient populations shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-1200 mg daily for 2-16 weeks decreases levels of total cholesterol by 11 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol by 11 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 31 md/dL when compared with placebo. It is unclear whether dose or treatment duration affect these outcomes ( 107885 ). These findings are limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies and patient populations. Also, a single study included in these meta-analyses provided alpha-lipoic acid intravenously. Other clinical trials have investigated the effect of alpha-lipoic acid on plasma lipids. In a large group of generally healthy adults, taking alpha-lipoic acid 800-1200 mg daily for 4 years reduces levels of total and LDL cholesterol, as well as triglycerides, when compared to baseline. The 1200 mg daily dose was more effective than the 400 mg daily dose ( 104650 ). Furthermore, an additional clinical study in adults with gestational diabetes, most of whom had elevated cholesterol levels at baseline, shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid (Puritan's Pride) 100 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces triglycerides, but does not improve levels of total, HDL, or LDL cholesterol, when compared with placebo ( 107890 ). The validity of this study is limited due to short duration of treatment. However, there is contrasting evidence in overweight or obese adults. A meta-analysis of several clinical studies in this population shows that ALA does not improve levels of HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, or triglycerides when compared with placebo. ALA 300-1800 mg daily was taken for 4-24 weeks in most of the included studies ( 116614 ). These findings are limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies and patient populations. Also, a single study included in this meta-analysis provided alpha-lipoic acid intravenously. The reason for the discrepant findings could be contributed to the heterogeneity among the included clinical studies, including existing comorbidities in the patient populations and the incorporation of dietary and exercise programs. Also, while many patients in these studies may have had elevated lipid levels at baseline, none of the studies specifically evaluated patients with hyperlipidemia. Thus, the benefits of alpha-lipoic acid in these patients is unclear. more Obesity. Most research shows that oral alpha-lipoic acid seems to improve weight loss by a small amount. While individual clinical studies show mixed results ( 21674 , 97630 , 100710 , 103327 , 103334 ), meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-1800 mg daily for 2-48 weeks can modestly reduce body weight by 0.7-2.3 kg and body mass index (BMI) by up to 0.5 kg/m2 when compared with placebo in overweight individuals or patients with obesity. The magnitude of these improvements are not dependent on the dose or duration of treatment ( 96231 , 96232 , 103332 , 111294 ). While these improvements are statistically significant, they may not be clinically meaningful. In addition, a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in adults with obesity shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-600 mg orally daily for 8-10 weeks improves some markers of insulin resistance, but not blood pressure or cholesterol levels ( 111294 ). Taking alpha-lipoic acid might also reduce body weight in overweight children or children with obesity. In adolescents aged 10-17 years, clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily for 3 months reduces body weight by 3.2 kg when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on blood lipids or fasting blood glucose ( 103330 ). Also, a small clinical study in children 8-16 years of age shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Tiobec 800, Laborest) 800 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve body weight, BMI, blood pressure, blood lipids, glycemic control, insulin resistance, or endothelial function when compared with placebo ( 100708 ). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in many of these outcomes. more Possibly Ineffective Alcohol-related liver disease. Oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to improve liver function in patients with alcohol-related liver disease. Taking alpha-lipoic acid orally 300 mg daily for up to 6 months does not appear to improve liver function or reduce liver damage when compared with placebo in patients with alcohol-related liver disease ( 3880 , 21678 ). more Altitude sickness. Oral alpha-lipoic acid, in combination with vitamins C and E, does not seem to be beneficial for altitude sickness prevention or treatment. Clinical research in healthy volunteers ascending to 5200 meters shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg in combination with vitamin C 1 gram and vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 400 IU in four divided doses daily, beginning on the day of travel to high altitude and continuing for 2 weeks thereafter, does not prevent the occurrence nor decrease the severity of altitude sickness when compared with placebo ( 20499 ). more Contrast induced nephropathy. Oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to prevent nephropathy after undergoing coronary angiography. In diabetic patients at low risk for contrast induced nephropathy, alpha-lipoic acid (Thioactacid 600 mg RH, MEDA Manufacturing GmbH) 600 mg taken 30 minutes prior to and 24 and 48 hours after undergoing coronary angiography, with or without standard hydration therapy, does not reduce the risk of contrast induced nephropathy when compared with standard hydration therapy ( 90442 ). In addition, treatment with alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally every 8 hours beginning the afternoon prior to angiography and continuing for 2 days does not attenuate the maximum increase in serum creatinine or reduce the incidence of contrast induced nephropathy in most patients when compared with standard hydration therapy alone ( 90446 ). more Diabetes. Oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to be beneficial for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although some conflicting findings from individual studies exist, the overall evidence does not support the use of oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid for improving glycemic control or insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 3545 , 3874 , 3875 , 3876 , 20490 , 20493 , 20494 , 20495 , 20496 , 90443 )( 90445 , 110118 , 111305 ). A meta-analysis of 16 small clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 200-1200 mg daily for up to 52 weeks leads to slight improvements in glycemic control and body weight, but these improvements are not clinically significant. When compared with placebo, alpha-lipoic acid reduced fasting blood glucose by 6 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.17%, body weight by 0.7 kg, and body mass index (BMI) by 1.1 kg/m2. While triglyceride levels were reduced by 19 mg/dL, improvements in other lipids levels and blood pressure were lacking ( 110118 ). A specific alpha-lipoic acid product administered orally or intravenously in some of these studies was Thioctacid (Asta Medica) ( 3874 , 3875 , 3876 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in patients with gestational diabetes or type 1 diabetes. A small clinical study in adults with gestational diabetes shows the taking alpha-lipoic acid (Puritan's Pride) 100 mg daily for 8 weeks improves fasting blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity but does not affect HbA1C when compared with placebo ( 107890 ). The validity of this study is limited due to its short duration, which was likely inadequate to detect a change in HbA1c. Also, one small clinical study in adolescent patients with type 1 diabetes who show signs of early stage diabetic cardiomyopathy shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily for 4 months, in combination with insulin therapy, improves left ventricular systolic and diastolic function ( 90443 ). more Diabetic retinopathy. Oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to prevent macular edema in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Some research shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 24 months does not improve the incidence of clinically significant macular edema when compared with placebo in patients with mild to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy ( 20491 ). more HIV/AIDS-related dementia. Oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to improve cognitive impairment related to this condition. Clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily, alone or along with selegiline (Deprenyl), for 10 weeks may worsen HIV-associated cognitive impairment and does not affect mood or functional status when compared with placebo in patients with confirmed HIV infection and evidence of cognitive impairment ( 1556 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Age-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for age-related cognitive decline. Preliminary clinical research in elderly adults shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve cognitive function scores when compared with baseline ( 111303 ). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for AMD. A small clinical trial shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Pure Encapsulations) 1200 mg daily for 18 months does not improve visual acuity or reduce the rate of atrophy when compared with placebo in patients with advanced AMD ( 103335 ). It is unclear if alpha-lipoic acid would be beneficial in patients with less severe symptoms of AMD. more Age-related testosterone deficiency. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A very small clinical study in males with overweight or obesity, mild erectile dysfunction, and normal to low androgen levels shows that taking a combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg, myo-inositol, folic acid, and apple (Sinopol Forte, Laborest) increases testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and measures of erectile dysfunction but not follicle-stimulating hormone or sperm parameters when compared to baseline ( 111674 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the small sample size and lack of a comparator group, and it is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Aging skin. Topical alpha-lipoic acid may be beneficial for aging skin. A small clinical study shows that applying a cream containing alpha-lipoic acid 5% to the face twice daily for 12 weeks reduces the fine lines and roughness associated with aging of facial skin when compared with a control cream ( 12021 ). more Alzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for this condition. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg once daily in combination with standard cholinesterase inhibitors may slow cognitive decline when compared with cholinesterase inhibitors alone in some patients with Alzheimer disease ( 20500 , 90437 ). However, higher-quality clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600-900 mg daily for up to 2 years, in combination with vitamin C and vitamin E, does not affect cognitive function when compared with placebo in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease ( 19206 , 20501 ). more Amanita mushroom poisoning. Evidence on the use of intravenous alpha-lipoic acid for amanita mushroom poisoning is limited to anecdotal reports. Intravenous alpha-lipoic acid has been used in combination with other treatments for poisoning from amanita mushroom ingestion. Its use is controversial. Reports are anecdotal, and experimental evidence does not support its effectiveness. Some researchers recommend against its use ( 105 , 1548 , 1549 , 3871 , 3879 ). more Anthracycline cardiotoxicity. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is effective for the prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity. A small clinical study in patients with breast cancer receiving doxorubicin shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 6 months does not improve ejection fraction but does decrease levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a marker of ventricular hypertrophy, when compared with placebo ( 110112 ). more Antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is effective for the prevention or treatment of antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. A very small, open-label study in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily along with conventional antipsychotic therapy for 12 weeks reduces prolactin levels by 51% when compared to baseline ( 110116 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. more Antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. Small clinical studies suggest that oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to improve antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects in patients with schizophrenia. A very small, open-label study in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily along with conventional antipsychotic therapy for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose levels by around 17 mg/dL but actually increases glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.14% when compared to baseline. No improvements in body weight or lipid levels were reported ( 110116 ). Another small clinical study in patients with schizophrenia stabilized on antipsychotic therapy for at least 1 year shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve body mass index (BMI) when compared with placebo ( 110115 ). more Aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer and aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia shows that taking a specific combination product (Opera, Gamfarma Srl) containing alpha-lipoic acid 240 mg, Boswellia serrata 40 mg, methylsulfonylmethane 200 mg, and bromelain 20 mg once daily for 6 months reduces arthralgia intensity when compared to baseline, with around 22% of patients having complete symptom resolution at the end of the study ( 109570 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group. more Atrial fibrillation. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for atrial fibrillation. Clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 12 months does not reduce the recurrence of atrial fibrillation when compared with placebo in patients who underwent a catheter ablation procedure. However, there was a decrease in the need for antiarrhythmic drugs in patients receiving alpha-lipoic acid ( 97628 ). more Back pain. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. An observational study in adults with chronic lower back pain and sciatica suggests that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg, palmitoylethanolamide 600 mg, and myrrh 200 mg daily for 30 days, along with periradicular infiltrations of oxygen-ozone, is associated with resolution of pain in 17% more patients when compared with periradicular steroid infiltrations at 60 days ( 111308 ). However, it is unclear if this effect is due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Beta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for reducing iron accumulation in beta-thalassemia major. A small, crossover study in patients with beta-thalassemia major who are receiving iron chelation therapy shows that adding oral alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg before breakfast or dinner for 8 weeks reduces levels of serum ferritin when compared with placebo ( 107888 ). Serum ferritin was reduced by 104 ng/mL and 38 ng/mL in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively. The validity of this finding is limited due to the small, exploratory nature of the study. more Bipolar disorder. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1000 mg plus alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg up to three times daily for 12 weeks does not improve depression when compared with placebo in patients with type I or type II bipolar disorder ( 90441 ). more Burning mouth syndrome. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for burning mouth syndrome. A meta-analysis of nine small, low-quality clinical trials in patients with burning mouth syndrome shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 400-800 mg daily for up to 2 months does not reduce pain intensity when compared with placebo or active controls such as multivitamins, Biotene mouth rinse, capsaicin, laser therapy, clonazepam, or pregabalin. However, in an analysis of three placebo-controlled studies, alpha-lipoic acid increased the likelihood of any burning mouth syndrome-related symptom improvement by 92% when compared with placebo ( 110111 ). Individual studies, most of which were included in the analysis, show conflicting results overall ( 20474 , 21661 , 21662 , 21663 , 21664 , 21665 , 21666 , 111427 ). One small clinical trial shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily improves symptoms of burning mouth syndrome in patients who had never previously been treated with anxiolytics or antidepressants, but not in those who had received these prior treatments ( 21668 ). This suggests that alpha-lipoic acid may improve symptoms of burning mouth syndrome resulting from stress, but not from depression or drug-induced hyposalivation. more Cancer. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for preventing or treating cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for preventing or treating CVD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. Carpal tunnel syndrome. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for carpal tunnel syndrome, either before or after surgery. In patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 60 days reduces pain by a moderate amount when compared with not taking alpha-lipoic acid, but with no effect on functionality ( 103328 ). In patients with neuropathic pain due to carpal tunnel syndrome, giving alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg intravenously daily for 30 days, then 600 mg orally daily for 60 days, decreases pain on a visual analog scale, and improves functionality when compared with oral alpha-lipoic acid alone, or no treatment ( 112938 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. One study shows that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg and gamma-linolenic acid 360 mg for 90 days improves functional scores and subjective symptom scores when compared to baseline ( 21653 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Another clinical study in adults with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking a combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, phosphatidylserine, turmeric, and vitamins C, E, B1, B2, B6, and B12 twice daily for 60 days reduces symptom severity and pain but does not improve measures of hand and wrist function when compared with control ( 111702 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding. The study may also be inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Additionally, it is unclear if the effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in patients who have undergone carpal tunnel release surgery. Taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 40 days starting immediately after surgery does not improve the rate of nerve recovery when compared with placebo, although it seems to reduce the occurrence of post-operative pillar pain, which is a common complication of carpal tunnel release surgery ( 96233 ). more Cataracts. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for cataracts, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. Cervical dysplasia. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with cervical dysplasia. A small clinical study in patients with low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 3 months reduces the proportion of patients with intraepithelial neoplasia by 95% when compared with placebo ( 110113 ). more Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of oral alpha-lipoic acid for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. One clinical study shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg three times daily for 24 weeks during treatment with cisplatin or oxaliplatin does not affect the symptoms or severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy when compared with placebo ( 90439 ). However, another small clinical study in patients with breast cancer receiving paclitaxel shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 6 months reduces the severity of peripheral neuropathy when compared with placebo ( 110112 ). The reason for this disparate finding is unclear, but it may be due to differences in chemotherapy regimens. Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study shows that taking a specific product (Opera, Gamfarma s.r.l.) containing alpha-lipoic acid 240 mg, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) 200 mg, Boswellia serrata 40 mg, and bromelain 20 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces overall pain when compared to baseline in adults with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( 96449 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group. Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally once daily and ipidacrine 20 mg orally three times daily throughout 6 paclitaxel-based chemotherapy cycles improves sensory nerve action potential parameters when compared with control ( 111292 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. Chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for CKD. Preliminary clinical research in patients with stage 2 or 3 CKD related to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 1.6 grams daily for 6 months has modest benefits on biochemical markers and cognitive tests when compared to control. Taking alpha-lipoic acid reduces serum glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and uric acid levels, and improves insulin resistance and flow-mediated dilation and cognitive test results. However, there was no effect on intima media thickness or the ankle brachial index ( 101867 ). more Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery shows that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg, coenzyme Q10 100 mg, magnesium orotate 400 mg, and omega-3 fatty acids 300 mg three times daily, with selenium 200 mcg once daily, for up to 2 months prior and 1 month after surgery, decreases plasma troponin levels and reduces the average postoperative hospital stay by 1.2 days when compared with placebo ( 21651 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to alpha-lipoic acid, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with persistent loss of the sense of smell after COVID-19 infection. In adults with sense of smell loss persisting for more than 3 months after COVID-19 infection, adding alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily orally for 12 weeks to olfactory training reduces the incidence of anosmia, and improves the olfactory threshold, the sense of smell measured on a visual analog scale, and the smell identification score by a similar amount to placebo ( 112935 ). Additionally, a small clinical trial in adults with persistent olfactory dysfunction and treatment refractory parosmia due to previous COVID-19 infection shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg daily for 6 months in combination with olfactory training does not improve tests of odor threshold, detection, and identification or reduce patient-reported symptoms of parosmia when compared with olfactory training alone ( 113892 ). more Diabetic nephropathy. When used in combination with certain conventional medications, intravenous or oral alpha-lipoic acid may improve some measures of albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Preliminary clinical research shows that intravenous alpha-lipoic acid (YantaiZhichu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) 450 mg plus intravenous alprostadil 20 mcg once daily for 14 days reduces urinary albumin excretion rate by 23% and cystatin C levels by 19% when compared with alprostadil alone ( 96221 ). Patients treated with alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg intravenously plus valsartan 80 mg orally once daily for 14 days showed a 25% lower urinary albumin excretion rate and a 27% and 31% lower serum level of beta2-microglobulin and cystatin C, respectively, when compared with patients treated with valsartan alone ( 101866 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg, 450 mg, or 600 mg daily in combination with oral valsartan 80 mg daily for 14 days reduces urinary albumin excretion rate, as well as levels of urinary albumin and serum beta 2-microglobulin, when compared with either valsartan or alpha-lipoic acid alone ( 107891 ). These findings are limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies and the presence of potential publication bias. Additionally, the long-term benefits of alpha-lipoic acid are unclear. Another meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with diabetes shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily in conjunction with other medications (e.g. antihypertensives, vitamin B6) for 3-18 months reduces levels of urine albumin, but does not improve urinary albumin excretion rate, when compared with placebo. Notably, alpha-lipoic acid alone did not affect outcomes ( 107886 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies; additionally, the quality of evidence was considered low to moderate. more Dry eye. It is unclear if topical alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with dry eye. A small clinical study in patients with diabetes and dry eye symptoms shows that application of an eye drop containing alpha-lipoic acid 0.1% and hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) 0.3% three times daily for 2 months does not improve subjective or objective measures of dry eye symptoms when compared with HPMC alone ( 110119 ). more Dysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for dysmenorrhea. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally daily, with or without mefenamic acid 250 mg daily, for 5 days starting before menstruation reduces pain associated with moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea by approximately 24% and 44%, respectively, when compared to baseline ( 101871 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Erectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for ED. Preliminary clinical research in males with diabetes and ED shows that intravenous alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg with alprostadil 10 mcg once daily for 14 days improves the quality and frequency of erection in 95% of patients, compared with only 81% of those taking tadalafil 5 mg orally daily ( 96224 ). It is not clear if this improvement is due to alpha-lipoic acid, alprostadil, or the combination. Another very small study in males with mild ED, overweight or obesity, and normal to low androgen levels shows that taking a combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg, myo-inositol, folic acid, and apple (Sinopol Forte, Laborest) improves measures of erectile dysfunction when compared to baseline ( 111674 ). The validity of these finding is limited by the small sample size and the lack of a comparator group, and it is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Fibromyalgia. It is unclear if intravenous alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for fibromyalgia. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (SiSU Vita Health) 600-1800 mg daily for 4 weeks does not reduce pain intensity when compared with placebo in patients with fibromyalgia ( 104655 ). Alpha lipoic acid has also been studied as a combination therapy for fibromyalgia. Preliminary clinical research in adults with fibromyalgia shows that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid and pregabalin for 6 weeks does not improve pain or depression scores when compared with either product alone ( 111428 ). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Glaucoma. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in adults with open-angle glaucoma shows that taking a combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg, omega-3 fatty acids 2240 mg, vitamin C 180 mg, vitamin E 27.9 mg, lutein 10 mg, zeaxanthin 2 mg, zinc 15 mg, copper 1 mg, and taurine 150 mg (NuaDHA Vision, Nua Biological) orally daily for 6 months does not improve intraocular pressure when compared with baseline ( 111310 ). more Heart failure. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in patients with heart failure participating in a handgrip exercise shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid, vitamin E, and vitamin C reduces mean arterial pressure by about 6 mmHg and reduces vascular resistance by about 12% when compared with placebo ( 19219 ). The first dose consisted of vitamin E 200 IU, vitamin C 500 mg, and alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg. The subsequent dose consisted of vitamin E 400 IU, vitamin C 500 mg, and alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg ( 19219 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Hemorrhoids. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for hemorrhoids. A preliminary open-label clinical trial shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 200 mg daily for 12 weeks decreases anal pain while sitting, pain at defecation, itching, and bleeding when compared with no treatment in patients with second- and third-degree hemorrhoids ( 100707 ). The validity of these results is limited by a lack of blinding and placebo control. more Herniated disc. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small observational study in adults with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy secondary to lumbar disc herniation shows that taking a combination supplement containing alpha-lipoic acid 404 mg, myrrh, and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) (Tiobec Dol, Uriach Italy Srl) twice daily for 4 weeks, along with steroids and as needed opioids, reduces pain and disability and improves physical but not mental health as it pertains to quality of life when compared with steroids and as needed opioids alone ( 111711 ). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more HIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for patients with HIV/AIDS who are unresponsive to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A small clinical study in patients who were unresponsive to HAART shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Alpha Lipoic Sustain 300, Jarrow Formulas) 300 mg three times daily for 6 months improves lymphocyte proliferation and whole blood glutathione levels when compared with placebo. However, there was no change in HIV RNA levels or CD4 count ( 21655 ). more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for hypertension. Clinical research in a small number of patients with mild (stage I) hypertension shows that adding alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily to quinapril 40 mg daily for 8 weeks does not significantly decrease blood pressure when compared with quinapril alone ( 21656 ). A meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials shows that alpha-lipoic acid lowers systolic blood pressure by a mean of about 5 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure by a mean of about 3 mmHg, but there is significant heterogeneity between the studies. The small decrease in blood pressure is also only seen with doses of alpha-lipoic acid below 800 mg daily when given for 12 weeks or less ( 112934 ). more Hypertriglyceridemia. Clinical studies suggest that oral alpha-lipoic acid does not reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, however it might be beneficial in certain populations. In overweight adults with elevated triglycerides, taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 24 weeks does not reduce triglyceride levels when compared with placebo ( 103327 ). In addition, a meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials in patients with or without hypertriglyceridemia at baseline shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-1200 mg daily for up to 16 weeks does not improve triglyceride levels when compared with placebo ( 100709 ). However, one clinical study in adults with gestational diabetes, most of whom had elevated triglyceride levels at baseline, shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Puritan's Pride) 100 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces triglyceride levels by 30 mg/dL, compared with an increase of 5 mg/dL in those taking placebo, a difference that was statistically significant ( 107890 ). The validity of this study is limited due to short duration of treatment. more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for prediabetes. A small clinical study in patients with prediabetes shows that intravenous alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 2 weeks decreases postprandial plasma glucose, steady state plasma insulin, cholesterol, and fatty acid levels and increases insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo ( 21657 ). In a large group of generally healthy adults, taking alpha-lipoic acid 800-1200 mg for 4 years reduces levels of fasting plasma glucose when compared with baseline. The 1200 mg daily dose was more effective than the 400 mg daily dose ( 104650 ). While some patients in this study had prediabetes or impaired fasting glucose at baseline, the study did not specifically evaluate patients with prediabetes. more Infertility. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid to increase the chance of pregnancy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for infertility. Interstitial cystitis. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. In individuals with vulval pain associated with painful bladder syndrome, clinical research shows that taking a specific product containing alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg, docosahexaenoic acid 250 mg, eicosapentaenoic acid 16.67 mg, vitamin E 12 mg, vitamin D 5 mg, and magnesium 56.25 mg (ALAnerv Age; Alfa Wassermann) daily in combination with amitriptyline up to 30 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces pelvic pain between 15% to 49% more than amitriptyline alone. Also, use of the combination supplement more than doubled the number of patients with an improvement in pain during intercourse ( 97629 ). It is unclear if the benefit is associated with alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Lyme disease. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. Male infertility. Most clinical studies suggest that oral alpha-lipoic acid might improve some sperm characteristics in males with infertility. However, it is unclear whether alpha-lipoic acid improves pregnancy or live birth rates in these individuals. A meta-analysis of 5 moderate-quality clinical studies in males with infertility shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 80-90 days modestly increases sperm progressive and total motility and reduces abnormal sperm morphology when compared with placebo. However, sperm concentration, sperm vitality, semen volume, and pregnancy rates show no significant improvements when compared with placebo ( 116615 ). Another small clinical study in males with infertility due to high levels of sperm DNA damage shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 80 days does not improve pregnancy rate, sperm motility, sperm concentration, semen volume, or other measures of sperm health when compared with placebo ( 110109 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in males with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) shows that taking one tablet daily of a specific product (Fertiplus SOD, Idi-Pharma) containing alpha-lipoic acid, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and other nutrients 30 days prior to IVF procedures improves the pregnancy rate from 9% of all embryo transfers pre-treatment to 45% and reduces the rate of miscarriage when compared to baseline ( 97627 ). It is unclear if the benefit is associated with alpha-lipoic acid, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome. Preliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally daily for 12 weeks modestly improved serum triglyceride levels, but not serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo ( 111307 ). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Migraine headache. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with migraine headaches. A meta-analysis of two small, moderate-quality clinical studies in adults in Iran and Belgium with migraine shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 3 months reduces migraine frequency by approximately 1 per month and improves migraine severity, but not migraine duration when compared with placebo ( 115873 ). However, clinical significance is unlikely. Furthermore, the validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity across clinical studies. A small clinical study, not included in the above meta-analysis, in adults with migraine shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg twice daily for 6 months reduces migraine frequency by at least 50% in 69% of patients and reduces the need for migraine treatment by 56% when compared to baseline, although the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group ( 96229 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in adolescents for migraine prophylaxis. A small open-label study in adolescents aged 10-19 years with a history of migraine shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg with flunarizine 5 mg as prophylaxis daily for 12 weeks reduces the frequency of migraine attacks and reduces monthly migraine headache days by 9 days, but does not reduce migraine severity or measures of disability when compared with flunarizine alone. For every 3 patients treated with alpha-lipoic acid and flunarizine over flunarizine alone, 1 additional patient had a 50% or greater reduction in migraine frequency ( 111706 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding. more Miscarriage. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in pregnant adults with threatened miscarriage between the 6 th and 13 th week of gestation shows that taking a specific combination product (DAV HA, Lo.Li pharma s.r.l) containing alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg, hyaluronic acid, magnesium, vitamin B6, and vitamin D daily in combination with conventional treatment of vaginal progesterone over 2 weeks of observation results in a faster resorption of the subchorionic hematoma and faster decrease of patient-reported vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and uterine contractions when compared with vaginal progesterone alone ( 113893 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo for the control group. more Muscle strength. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid prevents a loss of muscle strength after exercise. In athletes, a small clinical trial shows that taking a single dose of alpha-lipoic acid 150 mg (Athenion GmbH) after an intensive load protocol does not prevent loss of leg strength approximately 24 hours later when compared with placebo. However, taking the same dose for 2 days, followed by 300 mg daily during a 6-day training protocol, results in the maintenance of leg strength, compared with a loss in those taking placebo ( 104652 ). more Neck pain. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg plus superoxide dismutase 140 IU once daily for 2 months, along with physiotherapy, reduces chronic neck pain in approximately 50% more patients when compared with physiotherapy alone ( 90440 ). more Neuropathic pain. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with neuropathic pain. In patients with peripheral neuropathies, taking alpha-lipoic acid orally, up to 1800 mg daily for 6 weeks, is less effective for reducing pain intensity scores and improving quality of life than pregabalin, taken orally in doses up to 450 mg daily ( 112940 ). A nonblinded clinical study in patients with refractory chronic lumbosacral radicular pain shows that taking alpha lipoic acid orally, 600 mg three times daily for 3 weeks followed by 600 mg daily for 2 weeks, in addition to a single, pulsed radiofrequency treatment to the dorsal ganglion, improves pain severity and disability scores at 6 months when compared with pulsed radiofrequency treatment alone. A pain score of less than 4 is achieved at 12 weeks in about 80% of patients taking alpha lipoic acid, compared with about 65% of patients without alpha-lipoic acid. ( 107895 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for NAFLD. Small clinical studies in adults with NAFLD and obesity show that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally twice daily for 8-12 weeks does not improve liver health markers, such as liver function test levels or liver steatosis, cholesterol levels, body weight, or visceral fat when compared with placebo or control ( 104660 , 100710 , 111304 ). However, these clinical trials show that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally twice daily for 8-12 weeks may provide small improvements in interleukin-6 levels, adiponectin levels, and insulin resistance ( 104660 , 100710 ). However, these studies may have been inadequately powered to detect differences in some of these outcomes. more Orthostatic hypotension. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for orthostatic hypotension. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 430-788 mg orally daily for a mean of 2.3 years attenuates changes in blood pressure upon standing when compared with baseline in some patients with chronic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic intolerance ( 101868 ). more Osteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for osteoarthritis. A small nonrandomized study in adults with osteoarthritis and type 2 diabetes shows that taking alpha lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 6 weeks with standard therapy (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications) improves patient-reported assessment of pain and functionality when compared with standard therapy alone ( 115743 ). However, clinical significance is unclear, and the validity of these results is limited due to the lack of statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons. more Pain (chronic). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for various chronic pain conditions. A clinical study in patients with untreated, mild to moderate idiopathic pain (i.e. neuropathic pain, joint pain, and muscle pain with unknown etiology) shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg once or twice daily for 2 months may improve pain severity when compared with baseline, with greater effects observed with daily doses of 800 mg ( 107887 ). Although the study enrolled a control group, a statistical comparison between groups was not conducted, limiting the validity of this finding. Additionally, sub-analyses evaluating outcomes based on type of chronic pain were not conducted. more Periodontitis. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with moderate or advanced periodontitis shows that taking a supplement containing alpha-lipoic acid 25 mg, coenzyme Q10, cranberry extract, grapeseed extract, selenium, vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard nonsurgical therapy does not reduce periodontal indices including bleeding on probing, gingival recession, plaque index, or inflammation, among others, when compared with placebo ( 111708 ). more Peripheral arterial disease (PAD). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for PAD. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily reduces pain associated with exercise in people with PAD and claudication when compared with placebo. However, exercise tolerance does not seem to improve ( 16391 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for PCOS. Alpha-lipoic acid has been studied alone and in combination with inositol for the treatment of PCOS. A meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials in young adults with overweight and PCOS shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg daily for 6-25 weeks, alone or in combination with inositol, reduces fasting blood sugar and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) when compared with control. However, there is no effect on insulin levels, body mass index, lipid profile, or hormone levels ( 112939 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in a number of retrospective observational studies for PCOS. A small retrospective study in patients with PCOS and overweight or obesity suggests that taking alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg daily for 12 weeks is associated with improved insulin sensitivity, hepatic insulin extraction index, and levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase when compared to baseline. However, levels of reproductive hormones did not change over the 12 weeks ( 113895 ). Other observational research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 2000 mg, alone or in combination with myo-inositol (Sinopol, Laborest s.r.l.) 800-1000 mg, daily for 3-24 months is associated with reduced insulin levels and reduced menstrual cycle length, but not weight loss or improvements in hirsutism or insulin resistance, when compared to baseline ( 101869 , 101870 ). Another observational study shows that taking alpha lipoic acid 800 mg with a higher dose of myo-inositol 2000 mg is associated with slightly greater weight loss when compared with myo-inositol 1000 mg daily ( 103751 ). Also, taking alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not affect levels of reproductive hormones, although improvements occur when alpha-lipoic acid is taken in combination with inositol 1000 mg daily ( 101870 ). The validity of this research is limited by the retrospective nature of the studies. Additionally, all of observational studies were conducted in Italy, which may limit generalizability of findings to other geographic regions and populations. more Preterm labor. It is unclear if vaginal alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for preventing preterm birth. Preliminary clinical research shows that administering alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg vaginally once nightly for 30 days after an episode of preterm labor prevents cervical shortening when compared with placebo ( 96226 ). It is unclear if these findings are associated with a reduction in the rate of preterm birth. more Radiation exposure. Oral alpha-lipoic acid might reduce radiation levels in children living in areas contaminated with radiation. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg, alone or in combination with vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol) 200 mg, daily for 28 days reduces chemiluminescence in leukocytes and urinary radioactivity when compared to baseline in children living in areas contaminated with radiation ( 21669 ). more Schizophrenia. There is mixed evidence regarding the effectiveness of oral alpha-lipoic acid in patients with schizophrenia. A small clinical study in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia receiving conventional antipsychotic therapy shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg daily for 8 weeks improves scores related to negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but not positive symptoms, when compared with placebo ( 110114 ). A very small, open-label study in patients with stable, chronic schizophrenia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg daily along with ongoing antipsychotic medication for 4 months improves symptoms by 64% when compared to baseline. Specific symptom domains, including negative and positive symptoms, excitement, depressive symptoms, and extrapyramidal symptoms all show improvement, although the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group ( 96228 ). In contrast, another small clinical study in patients with schizophrenia stabilized on antipsychotic therapy for at least 1 year shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve symptoms of schizophrenia or cognitive function when compared with placebo ( 110115 ). Also, a very small, open-label study in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily along with conventional antipsychotic therapy for 12 weeks does not improve positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia when compared to baseline ( 110116 ). A meta-analysis of 4 studies in patients with clinically stable schizophrenia does not show any benefit of oral alpha-lipoic acid when compared with placebo, although details of the analysis are limited ( 112936 ). Overall, the reasons for the disparate research findings are unclear, but they may be due to differences in the alpha-lipoic acid dose, treatment duration, and severity of schizophrenia across studies. Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in patients who responded well to antipsychotic therapy after a single episode of psychosis shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 150 mg, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 1000 mg, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 500 mg twice daily does not prevent 2-year cumulative relapse or delay relapse time when compared with placebo ( 90675 ). more Sciatica. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for sciatica. Preliminary clinical research in patients with sciatica secondary to a herniated disc shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Byodiniral 300 QR, MDM SpA) 600 mg daily for 60 days improves signs and symptoms of sciatica and decreases the use of analgesics when compared with taking acetyl-L-carnitine (Nicetile, SigmaTau Ind. Farm. Riunite SpA) 1180 mg daily ( 21671 ). However, taking alpha-lipoic acid does not affect sleep quality in these patients. Alpha-lipoic acid has also been studied in combination with other ingredients for sciatica. Observational research in patients with sciatic pain due to herniated discs suggests that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg, myrrh extract 200 mg, and palmitoylethanolamide 600 mg daily for 20 days along with 3 sessions of oxygen-ozone therapy over 30 days is associated with slight improvements in pain when compared with oxygen-ozone therapy alone ( 111113 ). It is unclear if the effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Tinnitus. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for tinnitus. A small observational study in patients with tinnitus associated with cochlear dysfunction and metabolic syndrome suggests that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg for 60 days is associated with improvements in several audiometric parameters and overall tinnitus handicap inventory scores, with a larger effect on functional and emotional scores, when compared to baseline. However, patients with tinnitus secondary to acoustic nerve lesions do not appear to benefit from alpha-lipoic acid supplementation ( 111705 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of a comparator group. more Toxin-induced liver damage. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients being treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 250 mg, coenzyme Q10 200 mg, and acetyl-L-carnitine 250 mg twice daily for 2 weeks reduces the risk of drug-induced liver injury by 73% when compared with placebo ( 107445 ). It is unclear if these findings are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Vertigo. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in adults with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 20 ng/mL shows that taking a specific combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg, zinc 7.5 mg, L-carnosine 165 mg, curcumin 100 mg, piperine 1 mg, cholecalciferol 800 units, vitamin B2 0.8 mg, and vitamin B6 1 mg (Vertistop D, Difass) orally daily for 6 months moderately reduces the number of vertigo relapse episodes when compared with control. However, in patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels greater than 20 ng/mL that took a specific combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg, zinc 7.5 mg, L-carnosine 165 mg, curcumin 100 mg and piperine 1 mg (Vertistop L, Difass) orally daily for 6 months there was no difference in relapse episodes when compared with control ( 111294 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Vitiligo. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for vitiligo when used in conjunction with phototherapy. When used in combination with phototherapy, clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Shandong Qidu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) 300 mg daily for 6 months does not improve repigmentation when compared with placebo ( 104654 ). In contrast, a small clinical study shows that taking two tablets of a specific combination product (Lipoacid Combi, General Topics) containing alpha-lipoic acid 50 mg, vitamin C 50 mg, vitamin E 20 mg, and polyunsaturated fatty acids 12%, starting 8 weeks prior to ultraviolet B phototherapy and continuing for 6 months during phototherapy treatment, seems to increase the likelihood of repigmentation by 29% when compared with placebo ( 19210 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Wilson disease. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for Wilson disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. Wound healing. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for wound healing. A small clinical study shows that taking a specific alpha-lipoic acid product (Byodinoral 300, M.D.M. Spa) 300 mg one hour before and one hour after hyperbaric oxygen therapy administered daily for 14-30 days reduces wound area in 30% more patients with ischemic ulcers when compared with hyperbaric oxygen therapy alone ( 21677 ). more Wrinkled skin. Although there is interest in using topical alpha-lipoic acid for wrinkled skin, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. More evidence is needed to rate alpha-lipoic acid for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately. Alpha-lipoic acid has been used with apparent safety in doses of up to 2 grams daily for 3 months to 2 years. Lower doses of 600 mg daily have been used with apparent safety for up to 4 years ( 3540 , 3541 , 3542 , 20479 , 96449 , 97630 , 101867 , 101869 , 103327 , 103333 )( 103335 , 104651 , 104660 , 113892 , 113897 ). ...when used topically and appropriately.

Intravenous alpha-lipoic acid has been used safely in doses of up to 6000 mg weekly in clinical trials lasting up to 3 weeks ( 3540 , 3557 , 10148 , 12106 ). CHILDREN: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately. Alpha-lipoic acid has been used with apparent safety in doses of up to 600 mg daily for 3 months in children aged 10-17 years ( 103330 ). CHILDREN: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in amounts over 600 mg daily. At least five cases of alpha-lipoic acid intoxication have been reported for children aged 14 months to 16 years who consumed alpha-lipoic acid at doses up to 226 mg/kg (approximately 2400 mg). Symptoms of alpha-lipoic acid-induced intoxication included seizures, acidosis, vomiting, and unconsciousness ( 90444 , 96227 , 96234 , 104653 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Alpha-lipoic acid has been used safely during pregnancy at doses up to 600 mg daily for up to 4 weeks ( 96222 ).

See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization &amp; Formulation In one clinical trial, a specific formulation (Tri-low, Arjuna Natural Ltd.) of Indian gooseberry was prepared as the extract of the whole fruit, including the seeds. The extract was standardized to contain at least 35% polyphenols, 8% triterpenoids, and 10% oil ( 99238 ). Other extracts used in clinical trials have been prepared from the de-seeded fruit ( 92515 , 99240 , 99241 ). One such product (Capros) was standardized to contain about 60% low-molecular-weight hydrolysable tannins such as emblicanin-A, emblicanin-B, punigluconin, and pedunculagin ( 92515 , 105356 ). In one clinical trial, a topical product contained Indian gooseberry extract (Saberry) standardized to 10% beta-glucogallin ( 105353 ).

Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, Indian gooseberry may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs; however, research is conflicting. Clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry 500 mg as a single dose or twice daily for 10 days reduces platelet aggregation by about 24% to 36%, increases bleeding time by about 3.8-5.9 seconds, and increases clotting time by about 9.8-12.7 seconds when compared to baseline. However, taking Indian gooseberry 500 mg along with clopidogrel 75 mg or ecosprin 75 mg, as a single dose or for 10 days, does not significantly reduce platelet aggregation or increase bleeding time or clotting time when compared with clopidogrel 75 mg or ecosprin 75 mg alone ( 92514 ). Until more is known, use caution when taking Indian gooseberry in combination with anticoagulant/antiplatelet drugs. more ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Taking Indian gooseberry with antidiabetes drugs might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit or fruit extract alone or in conjunction with antidiabetes medications can lower blood glucose levels ( 31025 , 105355 , 105356 , 111569 ). Dose adjustments to diabetes medications might be necessary. more ASPIRIN Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination.

Clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry 500 mg as a single dose or twice daily for 10 days reduces platelet aggregation by about 24% to 36%, increases bleeding time by about 3.8-5.9 seconds, and increases clotting time by about 9.8-12.7 seconds when compared to baseline. However, taking a single dose of Indian gooseberry 500 mg along with ecosprin 75 mg, or taking a combination of Indian gooseberry 500 mg twice daily plus ecosprin 75 mg once daily for 10 days, does not significantly reduce platelet aggregation or increase bleeding time or clotting time when compared with ecosprin 75 mg alone ( 92514 ). more CLOPIDOGREL (Plavix) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination.

In humans, Indian gooseberry extract reduces levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) ( 92515 , 99241 , 102857 , 105356 ) and increases levels of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-10 ( 99846 ). Anticancer effects Indian gooseberry decreased tumor size and increased survival in tumor-bearing mice ( 31021 ). The juice of Indian gooseberry inhibits the formation of the genotoxic compounds N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and N-nitrosoproline (NPRO) in humans and animals ( 2080 ). Antioxidant effects In rats, the tannins emblicanin A, emblicanin B, punigluconin, and pedunculagin found in Indian gooseberry increased concentrations of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase within the brain ( 2081 ). Cardiovascular effects Clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry extract 250-500 mg twice daily orally for 12 weeks reduces levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), which is a marker of coronary heart disease ( 92515 , 102857 , 105356 ). Preliminary evidence also shows that Indian gooseberry fruit, juice, or extract may lower total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids, improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and have positive effects on atherosclerosis and endothelial function ( 2077 , 8180 , 102855 , 102857 , 105356 ). Animal studies suggest that Indian gooseberry may prevent age-related hyperlipidemia by reducing nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels via inhibiting NF-kappaB activation ( 31046 ). Coagulation effects Clinical research shows that Indian gooseberry extract can inhibit adenosine diphosphate (ADP)- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation ( 92514 , 92515 ). Indian gooseberry extract also inhibited platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 production in animals ( 2079 ). Constituents The applicable part of Indian gooseberry is primarily the fruit ( 2075 ), but extracts from the leaves and bark have also been used ( 2078 , 2079 , 99242 ). The vitamin C content of Indian gooseberry fruit has been assayed at approximately 1 gram per 100 mL of fresh fruit juice ( 31016 ). The fruit also contains gallic acid, flavonoids, and tannins such as emblicanin-A, emblicanin-B, punigluconin, and pedunculagin ( 92515 , 99240 ). Dental effects In humans, chewing gum containing Indian gooseberry fruit extract increased saliva flow and reduced levels of pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis ( 99239 ). Endocrine effects In animal studies and in vitro, Indian gooseberry reduces the release of inflammatory cytokines that cause insulin resistance ( 31025 ). Gastroprotective effects Alcoholic and aqueous extracts of Indian gooseberry show protective and healing effects in alcohol-induced gastric ulcers in animal experiments ( 31026 , 31036 ). Immunomodulatory effects Indian gooseberry extract inhibits leukotriene B4-induced migration, leukotriene B4 release, and degranulation of human polymorphonuclear lymphocytes in vitro ( 2078 , 2079 ).</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Indian%20Gooseberry</data><data key="scientific_name">Phyllanthus emblica (synonyms: Emblica officinalis, Mirobalanus embilica)</data><data key="overview_text">Indian gooseberry is a medium-sized deciduous tree that is native to India and the Middle East, but also grown in other countries such as Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Sri Lanka, China, and Malaysia. Indian gooseberry has been used in Ayurvedic, Unani, and other traditional Asian medicinal practices. Traditionally, Indian gooseberry has been used for ophthalmic, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, liver, and joint problems, as well as for gonorrhea and menstrual irregularities.</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Dyslipidemia. Oral Indian gooseberry seems to be beneficial for dyslipidemia. Meta-analyses of 12 small clinical studies in healthy adults or patients with dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or metabolic syndrome show that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract or powder 0.5-3 grams daily or Indian gooseberry fruit 12 grams daily for 2-12 weeks reduces total cholesterol by around 39 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 15-34 mg/dL, and triglycerides by around 22-52 mg/dL when compared with control groups. Results are conflicting whether Indian gooseberry increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ( 111567 , 111568 ). Subgroup analysis suggests that Indian gooseberry is more effective at doses greater than 1 gram daily and in adults with triglycerides above 150 mg/dL ( 111568 ). Clinical research in patients with dyslipidemia shows that taking Indian gooseberry whole fruit extract (Tri-low, Arjuna Natural Ltd.) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 34% and 20%, respectively, compared with 15% and 5%, respectively, in patients taking placebo ( 99238 ). more Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Oral Indian gooseberry seems to be beneficial for reducing symptoms of GERD. Clinical research in adults who have had non-erosive symptoms of GERD for at least 3 months shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract 1000 mg twice daily for 4 weeks reduces the frequency and severity of heartburn and regurgitation by about 63% and 50%, respectively, compared with reductions of 24% and 5%, respectively, in patients taking placebo ( 99240 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Aging skin. Oral Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in healthy, middle-aged females shows that drinking 50 mL of a juice containing Indian gooseberry extract 30-60 mg and lingonberry extract 25-50 mg daily for 12 weeks improves skin elasticity, thickness, wrinkles, and hydration when compared with placebo ( 102856 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to Indian gooseberry, lingonberry, or the combination. Another small clinical study in healthy, middle-aged females shows that applying a topical emulsion containing extracts of Indian gooseberry 3% and gotu kola 3% twice daily for 60 days improves skin hydration, some measures of skin wrinkles, and elasticity of the cheek but not the eye when compared with placebo ( 111571 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to Indian gooseberry, gotu kola, or the combination. more Androgenic alopecia. Topical Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. In individuals with self-perceived hair loss, preliminary clinical research shows that applying a hair product containing Indian gooseberry modestly improves hair growth rate and density, as well as hair thinning, when compared with baseline. Patients used a leave-in product containing Indian gooseberry (Saberry), coconut water solids (Cococin), gamma-L-glutamyl-selenomethionine (Peptiselect), and other ingredients as 3.5 mL in females and 2 mL in males, once daily for 3 months ( 105353 ). more Cancer. Although there is interest in using oral Indian gooseberry for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Indian gooseberry for this purpose. Cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for the prevention of CVD. A meta-analysis of 9 small clinical studies in adults who are healthy or have CVD risk factors shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract or powder 500-1500 mg daily for 2-12 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 15 mg/dL, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol by around 5 mg/dL, triglycerides by around 22 mg/dL, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein when compared with control groups. However, the meta-analysis suggests that Indian gooseberry does not improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, or diastolic blood pressure ( 111567 ). The validity of these findings is limited by small sample sizes and considerable heterogeneity among the included studies. more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. A small clinical trial in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 shows that receiving Indian gooseberry powder 2 grams twice daily for 10 days does not impact RT-PCR positivity rate at day 10 when compared with placebo. Additionally, there were no clear trends in clinical improvement in patients receiving Indian gooseberry when compared with placebo. All patients in this study also received oral hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir ( 110012 ). more Diabetes. Several small or limited-quality clinical studies suggest that oral Indian gooseberry may modestly improve glycemic control and blood lipid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. A moderate-sized, open-label study in adults with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia shows that taking Indian gooseberry extract, standardized to 10% beta-glucogallin, 2 grams daily for 90 days reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, and postprandial blood glucose when compared to baseline, with superior effects on fasting blood glucose and postprandial blood glucose when compared with metformin 500 mg ( 111569 ). A smaller clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes on stable doses of metformin shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract (Capros, Natreon Inc) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces HbA1c by around 0.5% and improves low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels when compared with placebo. Taking a lower dose, 250 mg twice daily, does not seem to improve HbA1c but has a modest effect on lipid levels ( 105356 ). Another small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes using various antidiabetes drugs shows that taking powdered Indian gooseberry fruit 1 gram, 2 grams, or 3 grams daily for 3 weeks modestly reduces fasting and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose levels and improves lipid levels when compared to baseline ( 105355 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Hangover. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for hangover prevention. A small clinical trial shows that taking Indian gooseberry leaf extract (Phyllpro) 750 mg daily for 10 days prior to alcohol intoxication modestly reduces some hangover symptoms 10 hours later, including nausea, headache, lack of appetite, and dizziness, when compared with placebo. Blood alcohol levels after 12 hours were also reduced. However, the overall hangover score was not significantly different between groups ( 99846 ). more Hepatitis B. Although there is interest in using oral Indian gooseberry for hepatitis B, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Indian gooseberry for this condition. Hypercholesterolemia. Small studies suggest that oral Indian gooseberry might help to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry might reduce levels of LDL cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia. One preliminary clinical study shows that taking Indian gooseberry 50 grams for 4 weeks decreases LDL cholesterol by 15% when compared to baseline ( 2077 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract (Amlamax, Arjuna Natural Ltd.) 500 mg or 1000 mg daily for 6 months reduces levels of LDL cholesterol by about 13% when compared with baseline ( 99241 ). Also, one small study shows that taking an Indian gooseberry fruit juice powder 500 mg daily for 6 weeks modestly decreases LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels when compared with baseline ( 99242 ). Some preliminary clinical research also shows that Indian gooseberry reduces LDL cholesterol in obese individuals. One small study shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract (Capros, Natreon Inc.) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces LDL cholesterol by 16 mg/dL in this population when compared to baseline ( 92515 ). However, the validity of these studies is limited by the lack of comparator groups. more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for hypertension. In patients with uncontrolled hypertension using standard therapies, clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry dried fruit powder 500 mg three times daily for 8 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 16% and 12%, respectively, from baseline, which is significantly greater than reductions seen with placebo. The frequency of response to treatment, based on a reduction in SBP or DBP of at least 10 mmHg or 5 mmHg, respectively, was also increased from up to 50% to at least 83% of patients ( 105352 ). However, other clinical research in adults with cardiovascular risk factors shows that taking Indian gooseberry 500-1500 mg twice daily for 2-12 weeks does not reduce SBP or DBP more than placebo ( 105354 , 111567 ). more Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small, open-label study of adults with IBS shows that taking 7 grams of an Unani medicinal product called Jawarish Shahi, containing Indian gooseberry, terminalia, coriander, cardamom, and willow bark, twice daily for 45 days reduces the severity of IBS, as measured by improvements in abdominal pain and distension, bowel habits, and quality of life, when compared to baseline ( 111570 ). The validity of these findings is limited by insufficient blinding and the lack of a comparator group. It is unclear if these effects are due to Indian gooseberry, other ingredients, or the combination. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for metabolic syndrome. Preliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a specific Indian gooseberry extract (Capros, Natreon Inc.) 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces total cholesterol by nearly 10%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 15%, and triglycerides by 10%, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by about 7% when compared with placebo. Additionally, taking this product as 500 mg twice daily reduces total cholesterol by 14%, LDL cholesterol by 26%, and triglycerides by 19%, and increases HDL cholesterol by 22% when compared with placebo. Both doses also seem to improve markers of endothelial function, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation ( 102857 ). more Obesity. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for improving weight loss or metabolic parameters in adults with obesity. Preliminary clinical research in overweight or obese individuals shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract (Capros, Natreon Inc.) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 16 mg/dL when compared to baseline. However, there was no effect on other lipids or on blood pressure, body weight, or body mass index ( 92515 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Oral mucositis. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial in patients with radiation-induced mucositis. A retrospective observational study in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy suggests that rinsing the mouth with Indian gooseberry 1% and povidone-iodine twice daily is associated with delayed development of mucositis and intolerable mucositis and a decreased incidence of intolerable mucositis when compared with povidone-iodine alone ( 111566 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the retrospective study design. more Osteoarthritis. Oral Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in adults with knee osteoarthritis suggests that specific Ayurvedic formulas containing Indian gooseberry may be equivalent to glucosamine sulfate 2 grams daily or celecoxib 200 mg daily for reducing pain. Two capsules containing Indian gooseberry 166.66 mg/capsule, ginger 33.33 mg/capsule, and Tinospora cordifolia 73.33 mg/capsule, with or without Boswellia serrata 100 mg/capsule, taken three times daily for 24 weeks, were used. All four treatments reduced active pain by about 28% to 38%, functional pain by 19% to 29%, and functional difficulty by 18% to 25%, with no significant between-group differences in the observed improvements ( 89557 ). It is not clear if these effects are due to Indian gooseberry, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Periodontitis. It is unclear if subgingival Indian gooseberry is beneficial for periodontitis. Clinical research in patients with chronic periodontitis shows that the subgingival application of a sustained-release Indian gooseberry fruit 10% gel following scaling and root planing does not affect plaque or gingivitis development over 2-3 months when compared with placebo. However, there was a modest benefit on periodontal destruction based on probing pocket depth ( 105358 ). more Vitiligo. Oral Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in patients with vitiligo shows that taking 1 tablet containing Indian gooseberry 100 mg, vitamin E 10 mg, and carotenoids 4.7 mg orally 3 times daily for 6 months, in combination with conventional topical therapy and/or phototherapy, increases re-pigmentation in the head, neck, and trunk and decreases signs of inflammation when compared with conventional treatment alone ( 92513 ). more More evidence is needed to rate Indian gooseberry for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods ( 6 , 2076 ).

Active constituents include corosolic acid and the ellagitannins lagerstroemin, flosin B, and reginin A ( 11954 , 11955 , 11956 ). Anticancer effects Laboratory research suggests that low concentrations of extracts from banaba inhibit DNA-protein interactions. The banaba extract inhibited nuclear factors and targeted DNA elements mimicking sequences recognized by the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) ( 33556 ). Banaba extracts inhibited cell proliferation in human tumor cell lines, including human erythromyeloid K562 ( 31024 ). Antidiabetes effect In diabetic animals and in humans with type 2 diabetes, banaba extract lowers blood glucose ( 11954 , 11955 ). In vitro research suggests that the ellagitannins have an insulin-like effect ( 11956 ). Research on lagerstroemin suggests that it might activate insulin receptors ( 11957 ). Antihypertensive effects In a model of hypertensive rats, banaba appears to modulate increased blood pressure when compared with untreated hypertensive rats. Additionally, researchers conclude that banaba may increase levels of nitric oxide (NO), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and may reduce levels of reactive oxygen species, oxidative stress enzymes, and inflammatory cytokines when compared with untreated hypertensive rats ( 110703 ). Weight loss effect In genetically diabetic obese mice, banaba seems to suppress weight gain ( 11959 ). In contrast, a study of hypertensive rats suggests that banaba prevents weight loss when compared with untreated hypertensive rats ( 110703 ).

One preliminary clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that a specific banaba extract (Glucosol), standardized to corosolic acid 1%, taken as 32 or 48 mg daily for 2 weeks is associated with 10% lower blood glucose levels when compared with placebo ( 11954 ). Another preliminary clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by oral antidiabetic agents shows that taking a specific combination product containing extracts of banaba leaf and Padang cassia (Inlacin, Dexa Medica) 100 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.65% when compared with baseline ( 92849 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if this effect is due to banaba, Padang cassia, or the combination. more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Oral banaba has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking a specific combination product containing extracts of banaba leaf and Padang cassia (Inlacin, Dexa Medica) daily for 12 weeks preserves beta-cell function and insulin release and improves insulin sensitivity, but not 2-hour postprandial glucose levels, when compared with placebo. All patients received 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks, and those considered to be non-responders were titrated up to 100 mg once daily for the remaining 8 weeks ( 92848 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to banaba, Padang cassia, or the combination. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral banaba is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome. A small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that a specific banaba extract (MonoHerb), standardized to corosolic acid 1.13%, taken as 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol when compared with baseline ( 108617 ).

Anti-inflammatory effects Two meta-analyses of a total of 19 clinical studies show that berberine can cause a small reduction in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a key marker of systemic inflammation ( 103196 , 104508 , 111362 ). A larger reduction in CRP was reported with berberine in a meta-analysis of 52 clinical studies involving patients with metabolic syndrome or other metabolic disorders. Berberine also appears to reduce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6), levels in these patients ( 110102 , 111362 ). Animal research shows that berberine can reduce chemical-induced swelling, possibly by inhibiting the expression of various cytokines ( 13529 , 33639 , 34298 ). Preliminary and human research suggests that berberine blocks production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL1)-beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, possibly by blocking nuclear factor-kappaB, the transcription factor responsible for regulation of cytokine production. As a result, berberine has potential usefulness in treating alcoholic liver disease, which is associated with increased levels of IL1-beta and TNF-alpha ( 13522 , 33674 , 34258 , 99922 ). Berberine also appears to decrease the production of IL-8, which is involved in inflammatory processes ( 33592 ). Preliminary research suggests berberine selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression ( 12488 , 33582 , 34258 ). Anticancer effects In vitro research shows that berberine can reduce the proliferation of leukemia, myeloma, oral squamous cell, esophageal, prostate, gastric, cervical, and breast cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and/or causing apoptosis ( 34196 , 34202 , 34219 , 34222 , 34229 , 34233 , 34236 , 34237 , 34238 , 34315 )( 34323 , 95716 ). Some preliminary research suggests that berberine can also inhibit the progression of leukemia, colon adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, astrocytoma, and glioblastoma multiform cells by inhibiting the activity of arylamine N-acetyltransferase ( 34197 , 34198 , 34206 , 34214 ). Arylamine N-acetyltransferase has been shown to be involved in the growth and chemotherapy drug resistance of cancer ( 91947 ). Berberine also appears to inhibit tumor angiogenesis in vitro by inducing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha repression ( 34226 ). In addition to preventing the growth and proliferation of cancer cells, berberine may also inhibit the ability of cancer to metastasize. Evidence from animal research shows that berberine can inhibit the metastasis of lung cancer to the lymph nodes ( 33587 ). In vitro research also shows that berberine can inhibit the metastasis of melanoma cells ( 34284 ). In addition to its anticancer effects, berberine appears to enhance the effects of conventional cancer treatments, including radiation and chemotherapy, against some types of cancer. In vitro research shows that berberine can enhance the sensitivity of glioblastoma multiforme cells to ionizing radiation ( 34227 ). Other in vitro research shows that treatment of tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant cells with berberine and tamoxifen enhances G1 phase arrest and activates apoptosis compared to treatment with tamoxifen alone. Berberine is thought to increase the effectiveness of tamoxifen against breast cancer cells by inducing upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21, which is involved with breast cancer growth and development and plays a role in tamoxifen resistance ( 95716 ). Antidiabetic effects The blood-glucose lowering effect of berberine has been attributed to its ability to increase insulin receptor expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with type 2 diabetes ( 34265 ). Also, evidence from in vitro and animal research suggests that berberine increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity ( 34240 , 34242 , 34243 ). Activation of AMPK can stimulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscles, increase the oxidation of fatty acids in adipose tissue, and reduce the production of glucose in the liver ( 91948 ). Other evidence from animal research suggests that berberine increases glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion ( 34254 ). GLP-1 is an incretin that plays a role in the maintenance of glycemic control ( 91949 ). Some animal research also shows that berberine can increase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha and PPAR-delta expression, although berberine also appears to reduce PPAR-gamma expression in the liver of diabetic rats ( 34249 ). In addition to lowering blood glucose, berberine might also inhibit aldose reductase ( 13520 ). This might prevent nerve and eye damage in people with diabetes. Antidiarrheal effects Preliminary research in healthy individuals suggests that the antidiarrheal effect of berberine results from its ability to delay small intestinal transit time ( 33659 ). Also, evidence from animal research shows that berberine can inhibit the intestinal secretion of water, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate in response to enterotoxin from Vibrio cholera and Escherichia coli ( 33596 , 33651 , 33654 , 33655 , 33714 , 34309 ). Antilipemic effects Berberine is theorized to reduce lipids by enhancing hepatic uptake of low-density lipoprotein particles by inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), increasing fecal cholesterol excretion, improving hepatic cholesterol turnover, and decreasing intestinal cholesterol absorption ( 111363 ). Animal research shows that the hypocholesterolemic effects of berberine result from its ability to inhibit cholesterol absorption and increase bile acid synthesis ( 34264 ). Other animal research shows that berberine may improve lipid dysregulation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in the liver and muscles, thereby exerting effects on fatty acid oxidation, glucose generation, and insulin resistance ( 34257 , 111364 ). Antimicrobial effects Berberine has antimicrobial effects including antibacterial, antifungal, and some antimycobacterial and antiprotozoal activity ( 7258 , 7259 ). Berberine has activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Shigella boydii, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum gypseum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporotrichum schenckii, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, Trichomonas vaginalis, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium paraputrificum, Aspergillus species, Leishmania donovani, and Plasmodium falciparum ( 2530 , 2583 , 2587 , 2588 , 7258 , 7259 , 8012 , 12428 , 33690 , 33702 )( 33703 , 33705 , 34200 , 34208 , 34312 , 34334 ). Preliminary research suggests berberine might inhibit bacterial sortase, a protein responsible for anchoring gram-positive bacteria to cell membranes ( 13540 ). The activity of berberine against Plasmodium falciparum might result from its ability to inhibit telomerase activity ( 34213 ). Antioxidant effects Evidence from animal research shows that berberine increases the activity of superoxide dismutase and decreases levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide anion ( 34248 , 34252 ). Antiplatelet effects Evidence from animal research shows that berberine inhibits platelet aggregation ( 33660 ). In vitro research suggests that the antiplatelet effects of berberine result from its ability to inhibit the synthesis of thromboxane A2 ( 91950 ). Bone effects Evidence from animal research suggests that berberine can inhibit parathyroid hormone-stimulated bone resorption ( 33580 ). In doses of 30-50 mg/kg daily, berberine has demonstrated an ability to prevent a decrease in bone mineral density of lumbar vertebra in ovariectomized rats and induce apoptosis of osteoclastic cells ( 33580 ). Cardiovascular effects In humans, intravenous infusion of berberine appears to improve cardiac performance in patients with severe congestive heart failure ( 91951 ). The effect has been attributed to the ability of berberine to induce peripheral vasodilation and inotropic stimulation ( 33642 ). The positive inotropic effects of berberine have been confirmed in various animal models ( 33637 , 33642 , 33685 , 33708 , 33710 ). Also, in humans, oral berberine reduced myocardial injury, possibly by inhibiting the cellular pathway that causes apoptosis ( 99922 ). Berberine also appears to have an antihypertensive effect, which has been attributed to its ability to block alpha-adrenergic activity ( 13520 ). Other evidence from in vitro research suggests that berberine possesses partial alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist activity similar to that of clonidine ( 33606 ). Evidence from animal research shows that berberine has an antiarrhythmic effect and can restore ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm ( 33608 , 33636 , 33685 ). Berberine may increase the elasticity of the small arteries by increasing the mobilization of circulating endothelial progenitor cells ( 34244 ). Other evidence from animal research suggests that berberine can reduce oxidative stress and vascular inflammation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase activity ( 34281 ). Evidence from animal research shows that berberine can improve neointima formation following balloon injury in rats. This suggests that berberine might be able to help control restenosis after balloon angioplasty ( 34231 ). Endocrine effects In women with polycystic ovary syndrome, berberine hydrochloride has been shown to increase sex hormone binding globulin levels and decrease the free androgen index ( 34282 ). Gastroprotective effects Berberine appears to reduce the secretion of gastric acid ( 13537 ). Hepatoprotective effects Preliminary research suggests berberine might protect the liver from hepatotoxins. In an animal model, berberine reduced N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced liver injury, as evidence by the attenuation of increased liver weight, elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, and increased glutathione S-transferase levels ( 13521 ). Other animal research shows that berberine prevents elevations in levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) when administered prior to exposure to acetaminophen or carbon tetrachloride ( 13519 ). Other animal research suggests that berberine has antifibrotic effects and can increase the excretion of bilirubin from the liver. This suggests that berberine may have beneficial effects in treating liver fibrosis ( 34302 ). Muscle relaxant effects Evidence from animal research suggests that berberine can block acetylcholine-induced contraction of smooth muscles ( 33646 , 33692 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Possibly Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Berberine</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Canker sores. Some evidence shows that berberine gel applied to canker sores may reduce pain and the size of the sores, but it has not been compared to conventional treatments. Some clinical research shows that applying a gel containing berberine 5 mg/gram four times daily for 5 days can reduce pain by 26% and ulcer size by 30% when compared with placebo in patients with minor recurrent canker sores. Erythema and exudation also appear to be improved ( 91955 ). more Diabetes. Berberine seems to moderately reduce blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes; it may provide additional benefit when given with conventional medications. Some clinical research shows that taking berberine 500 mg 2-3 times daily for 2-4 months can reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial glucose (PPG) in subjects with type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo, and may be similarly effective to metformin 500 mg 2-3 times daily or rosiglitazone 4 mg daily ( 20579 , 34247 , 34265 , 110099 ). Large meta-analyses show that taking berberine, 0.9-3 grams in 2-3 divided doses daily for 1-11 months, in combination with lifestyle interventions, can reduce FPG by 10-16 mg/dL, PPG by 27-34 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 0.4% to 0.7% when compared with lifestyle interventions alone. Also, taking berberine in combination with oral hypoglycemic drugs appears to lower FPG by 12-19 mg/dL, PPG by 18-24 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 0.6% to 0.9% when compared with hypoglycemic drugs alone ( 91956 , 110097 ). Berberine has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking berberine 500 mg with Bifidobacterium adolescentis 100 million colony-forming units (CFU) twice daily for 16 weeks reduces FPG by 10 mg/dL, PPG by 28 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 0.22% when compared with placebo ( 110099 ). Another clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking berberine 600 mg twice daily with a multi-strain probiotic supplement, containing more than 50 billion CFU, once daily for 12 weeks reduces postprandial cholesterol by 15 mg/dL and postprandial low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 9 mg/dL when compared with placebo. Postprandial triglyceride levels were also improved, while postprandial levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were not affected ( 110100 ). more Helicobacter pylori. Oral berberine, when taken with amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) with or without clarithromycin, might be as effective as bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (BQT), vonoprazan quadruple therapy, and PPI-based triple therapy for eradication of Helicobacter pylori. Most studies evaluate berberine in combination with an antibiotic and acid blocker for the treatment of H. pylori infection. Open-label clinical studies in patients with treatment-naïve H. pylori infection shows that taking berberine 300-500 mg with amoxicillin 1 gram and an acid reducer such as esomeprazole 20 mg, rabeprazole 10 mg, or vonoprazan 20 mg, with or without clarithromycin 500 mg, 2-3 times daily for 14 days is non-inferior to BQT, vonoprazan quadruple therapy (vonoprazan, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, bismuth), and rabeprazole quadruple therapy (rabeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, bismuth) for H. pylori eradication and clinical symptom improvement. Eradication rates were around 70% to 91% and 69% to 90% in the berberine- and bismuth-containing groups, respectively. BQT is a guideline-recommended treatment regimen for H. pylori eradication ( 97234 , 111697 ). Also, berberine triple therapy appears to be better tolerated when compared with BQT. Quadruple therapy consisted of amoxicillin, rabeprazole, clarithromycin, and bismuth tartrate ( 110107 ). A smaller clinical study in patients with H. pylori-associated duodenal ulcers shows that taking berberine 300 mg three times daily for 6 weeks is more effective for eradicating H. pylori than taking ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, but is less effective for promoting ulcer healing ( 34319 ). more Hyperlipidemia. Clinical research shows that taking berberine orally, alone or in combination with other ingredients, reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides in people with hyperlipidemia. Meta-analyses of clinical research in people with hyperlipidemia or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) show that berberine reduces total cholesterol by 13-32 mg/dL, triglycerides by up to 34 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol by 10-26 mg/dL, and apolipoprotein B by 0.25 g/L when compared with control or lifestyle interventions. However, the meta-analyses conflict on the effect of berberine on HDL cholesterol, with the studies in patients with hyperlipidemia showing that it reduces HDL cholesterol by 2-3 mg/dL while the analysis in patients with NAFLD shows that berberine has no effect on HDL cholesterol when compared with control or lifestyle interventions. ( 20579 , 34228 , 111363 , 111700 , 113462 ). Meta-analyses also show that berberine alone is similarly effective to statins at lowering lipid levels ( 100983 , 111362 ). Administration of berberine in combination with lipid-lowering drugs such as statins lowers total cholesterol by 10-15 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol by up to 9 mg/dL, and triglycerides by up to 30 mg/dL when compared with lipid-lowering drugs alone ( 91953 , 91956 , 99921 , 100983 , 111362 ). The dosage of berberine used most often in these studies was 500 mg twice daily, or 200-500 mg three times daily for 3-24 months. However, one meta-analysis suggests that berberine's effects on lipid levels may be transient, with significant improvements in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol lacking in studies lasting 3 or more months ( 111362 ). Berberine has also been studied in combination with other supplements. Taking a combination product containing berberine 500 mg, policosanol 10 mg, and red yeast rice 200 mg daily for up to 12 months reduces total and LDL cholesterol levels when compared with placebo or ezetimibe 10 mg ( 34262 , 34283 , 34301 ). Taking another combination product (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm S.p.A.) containing berberine, red yeast rice, policosanol, folic acid, coenzyme Q10, and astaxanthin daily for up to 12 months reduces total cholesterol by 10% to 13% and LDL cholesterol by 14% to 21%, and increases HDL cholesterol by 4% to 5% when compared with baseline or placebo. These effects are comparable to those seen with pravastatin 10 mg daily ( 89438 , 92142 ). It is unclear if the benefits of this combination product are due to berberine, other ingredients, or the combination. It is possible that the majority of the therapeutic effect is due to an ingredient in red yeast rice (monacolin K) that is identical to lovastatin. more Hypertension. Berberine may have added benefits for reducing blood pressure when used in combination with amlodipine. A meta-analysis shows that taking berberine 0.9 grams daily in combination with amlodipine for 2 months reduces systolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg when compared with amlodipine alone ( 91956 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Berberine may improve some metabolic characteristics in women with PCOS and insulin resistance. It may also increase live births, although the data are conflicting. Clinical research in patients with PCOS and insulin resistance shows that taking berberine 500-550 mg 2-3 times daily for 3 to 6 months reduces fasting plasma glucose, markers of insulin resistance, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, testosterone levels, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, acne severity, and markers of inflammation when compared with placebo or baseline. Berberine also seems to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels ( 34282 , 91952 , 111364 ). Lipid parameters also improved when compared with metformin, as did waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index, and SHBG levels in some, but not all, studies ( 34282 , 91952 ). The effect of berberine on ovulation, pregnancy, and birth rates in women with PCOS is unclear. A meta-analysis of several small, lower quality clinical studies conducted in China in patients with PCOS shows that taking berberine 900 mg daily in combination with other treatments, such as clomiphene or letrozole, for 3 to 6 months improves ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates when compared to medication therapy alone ( 115725 ). The validity of these findings is limited by heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including treatment combinations and duration. Additionally, the effect on birth rates was not evaluated. A clinical study, not included in the analysis above, shows that taking berberine 500 mg three times daily for three months prior to controlled ovarian stimulation increases the number of clinical pregnancies and live births by almost two-fold when compared with placebo. These effects are comparable to taking metformin 500 mg three times daily for 3 months ( 91952 ). However, other clinical research shows that taking a combination of berberine 1.5 grams daily and letrozole for ovarian stimulation does not increase live birth rates when compared with letrozole alone ( 97235 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in patients with antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. A small clinical study in patients with schizophrenia who developed metabolic syndrome associated with antipsychotic therapy shows that taking berberine 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces body weight by 1.1 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 0.4 kg/m2, total cholesterol by 22 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 20 mg/dL, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.09% when compared with placebo ( 110103 ). more Atrial fibrillation. Limited research suggests that oral berberine might prevent atrial fibrillation shortly after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. A small clinical study in Chinese patients who underwent CABG surgery shows that taking berberine 400 mg three times daily for 7 days reduces the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation by 50% when compared with placebo ( 110106 ). more Biliary disorders. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in patients with biliary disorders. A small clinical study in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis shows that taking berberine ursodeoxycholate, an ionic salt formulation of berberine and ursodeoxycholic acid, 500-1000 mg twice daily for 6 weeks reduces levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a marker of cholestasis and bile duct injury, when compared with placebo. ALP levels decreased by at least 50% in 7% and 17% of patients taking 500 mg and 1000 mg, respectively, compared with 0% of patients taking placebo ( 110105 ). more Burns. Topical berberine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that topical treatment of second degree burns with an ointment containing berberine, beta-sitosterol, sesame oil, and other ingredients, applied every 4 hours for 20 days, is similar to conventional treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream ( 13526 ). It is unclear if this benefit is due to berberine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if berberine is beneficial in patients with CVD. A meta-analysis of several small clinical studies in patients with atherosclerosis, ischemic stroke, or coronary heart disease shows that taking berberine alone does not improve lipid levels or markers of atherosclerosis but does reduce markers of inflammation when compared with routine therapy or statins. Additionally, the pooled analysis suggests that berberine reduces stroke severity, as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale, in patients with ischemic stroke ( 111362 ). This meta-analysis also shows that, when taken with a statin, berberine improves lipid levels, stroke severity, markers of atherosclerosis, and inflammatory markers when compared with statin therapy alone or routine treatment ( 111362 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the overall low-quality of the included studies, with unclear blinding and randomization; significant heterogeneity and differences in patient populations, berberine doses, and treatment durations studied; and concerns related to publication bias. more Cholera. Although taking a single dose of berberine may be modestly beneficial for reducing stool volume, using berberine daily with tetracycline does not seem to provide added benefit. Some preliminary clinical research shows that a single dose of berberine sulfate 400 mg decreases 24-hour stool volume by a small amount in subjects with cholera when compared with placebo ( 262 ). However, taking berberine 200-400 mg daily along with tetracycline 500 mg four times daily does not seem to further enhance the effects of tetracycline in treating cholera-induced diarrhea ( 34305 , 34306 ). more Colorectal adenoma. Berberine may help prevent adenoma recurrence after polypectomy. Preliminary clinical research in Chinese patients with colorectal adenomas who had undergone complete polypectomy shows that taking berberine 0.3 grams twice daily for 2 years reduces the risk of adenoma recurrence by 22% when compared with placebo ( 103197 ). A meta-analysis of this trial and two other small clinical studies in Chinese patients with a history of colorectal adenomas shows that taking berberine 0.1 grams three times daily for 18 months or 0.3 grams twice daily for 2 years reduces the risk of adenoma recurrence by 31% and 25% at years 1 and 2, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 110101 ). All available research has been conducted in China; it is unclear whether these results can be applied to other geographic locations. more Congestive heart failure (CHF). Berberine may provide additional benefit to patients with CHF who are taking conventional medications. Preliminary clinical research in patients with CHF secondary to ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy shows that adding berberine 1.2-2 grams daily for 8 weeks to conventional medications can reduce the frequency and complexity of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and reduce mortality when compared with placebo ( 13520 ). more Coronary heart disease (CHD). Oral berberine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in statin-intolerant patients with coronary heart disease treated with a percutaneous intervention (PCI) shows that taking a specific combination product (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm S.p.A.) containing berberine 500 mg, red yeast rice 200 mg, policosanol 10 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, coenzyme Q10 2 mg, and astaxanthin 0.5 mg daily for 3 months reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to a greater extent than ezetimibe 10 mg daily. Combining this specific product with either ezetimibe or a low-dose statin produces additional improvements in all lipid parameters after 3-12 months of treatment when compared with any of the agents alone ( 97232 , 97233 ). It is unclear if the benefits of this combination product are due to berberine, other ingredients, or the combination. Because red yeast rice contains a compound identical to lovastatin (monacolin K), it is likely that the cholesterol-lowering potential of this combination is mainly attributable to the red yeast rice constituent. more Diarrhea. Limited data suggest that berberine may be helpful for diarrhea caused by bacteria. Some preliminary clinical research shows that a single dose of berberine sulfate 400 mg decreases 24-hour stool volume in subjects with Escherichia coli-induced diarrhea when compared with placebo ( 262 ). more Glaucoma. It is unclear if berberine is beneficial for glaucoma when used as an eye drop. Preliminary clinical research shows that using eye drops containing berberine 2.5 mg and tetrahydrozoline 2.5 mg for 3 days does not reduce intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma when compared with eye drops containing tetrahydrozoline alone ( 34304 ). more Hepatitis B. It is unclear if berberine is beneficial for improving liver function in people with hepatitis B. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 1 gram daily for 2 months decreases blood glucose, triglycerides, and markers of liver damage, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), in subjects with type 2 diabetes and hepatitis B when compared with control ( 34265 ). more Hepatitis C. It is unclear if berberine is beneficial for improving liver function in people with this form of hepatitis. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 1 gram daily for 2 months decreases blood glucose, triglycerides, and markers of liver damage, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), in subjects with type 2 diabetes and hepatitis C when compared with control ( 34265 ). more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Small studies suggest that oral berberine may be beneficial in adults with prediabetes. A very small clinical study in adults with overweight and prediabetes shows that taking berberine aqueous root extract (HIMABERB, Pharma Base S.A.) 500 mg 3 times daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by 15 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.7%, and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test by 28 mg/dL and improves fasting insulin levels and measures of insulin resistance when compared with placebo ( 111699 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a very small sample size. Another small clinical study in adults with prediabetes shows that taking berberine phospholipids (Berbevis, Indena, SpA, Italy) 550 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by 4 mg/dL and improves insulin levels when compared with placebo ( 111700 ). more Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). One small clinical study suggests that oral berberine may be beneficial in people with diarrhea-predominant IBS. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 400 mg twice daily for 8 weeks in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS reduces the frequency of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and defecation urgency when compared with placebo. Berberine may also improve overall symptom scores and IBS quality of life ( 97236 ). Observational research suggests that adding a supplement (Enterofytol PLUS, Tilman SA) providing berberine 200 mg and curcumin 42 mg orally twice daily for 2 months to conventional IBS treatment is associated with improvements in symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, distension, and stool status, by up to 48% when compared with conventional treatment alone. Use of the supplement was also associated with a 64% reduced need for conventional treatments ( 113354 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to berberine, curcumin, or the combination. more Menopausal symptoms. Oral berberine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of berberine plus soy isoflavones can reduce vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women when compared with taking calcium plus vitamin D ( 34287 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to berberine, soy isoflavones, or the combination. more Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in patients with MASLD. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with MASLD shows that taking berberine extract 500 mg orally three times daily for 12 weeks does not improve markers of liver damage or insulin resistance, fatty liver indices, or most lipid levels when compared with placebo ( 114769 ). Also review effectiveness in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a similar condition. more Metabolic syndrome. Berberine may reduce some of the signs and symptoms of metabolic syndrome, but the evidence is weak. Preliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking berberine hydrochloride 500 mg three times daily before meals for 3 months reduces body mass index (BMI) by 0.6 kg/m2, systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 8 mmHg, triglycerides by 18 mg/dL, and serum glucose levels by 2 mg/dL, and can also improve insulin sensitivity, when compared with baseline ( 91957 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group. Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination product (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm S.p.A.) containing berberine 500 mg, red yeast rice 200 mg, policosanol 10 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, coenzyme Q10 2 mg, and astaxanthin 0.5 mg daily for 18 weeks improves SBP, left ventricular mass, and flow-mediated dilation in patients with metabolic syndrome when compared with control ( 34289 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to berberine, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral berberine may improve some measures of liver function and blood lipids in people with NAFLD. A meta-analysis of clinical studies and preliminary clinical research in patients with NAFLD, some with comorbid type 2 diabetes, show that taking berberine 600 mg to 6.35 grams daily, alone or in combination with metformin or lifestyle interventions, for 7 to 22 weeks reduces markers of liver damage, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and improves body mass index (BMI), measures of insulin resistance, and most lipid parameters when compared with control and baseline ( 34286 , 113462 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 500 mg three times daily for 16 weeks reduces hepatic fat content by 21% when compared with lifestyle modification. Berberine also seems to reduce hepatic fat content, AST, and ALT similarly to pioglitazone 15 mg daily, while reducing body weight, body mass index, and total cholesterol more than pioglitazone ( 97237 ). Also review effectiveness in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a similar condition. more Obesity. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in patients with obesity. A meta-analysis of 12 small clinical studies, most in patients with various metabolic conditions, shows that taking berberine 300-1500 mg daily for up to 24 months reduces body weight by around 2 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 0.5 kg/m2, and waist circumference by about 1 cm when compared with a control group ( 104508 ). However, most of the studies are small, of varying quality, with significant heterogeneity, and likely inadequately powered to detect significant changes. Additionally, none of the studies required patients to have overweight or obesity for inclusion. more Radiation fibrosis. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial for reducing radiation-induced lung damage. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 20 mg/kg once daily for 6 weeks during radiation therapy reduces the incidence of radiation-induced lung injury and improves lung function in patients treated for NSCLC when compared with placebo ( 34253 ). more Radiation-induced diarrhea. One small study suggests that oral berberine may reduce diarrhea associated with radiation-induced intestinal damage. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 300 mg three times daily for 2 weeks can reduce the frequency and severity of radiation-induced intestinal damage and diarrhea in patients receiving abdominal or pelvic radiation therapy when compared with placebo ( 34263 ). more Stroke. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in adults with acute ischemic stroke. A meta-analysis of several small clinical studies in adults with acute ischemic stroke shows that taking berberine 0.3-1.0 grams daily for up to 6 months in addition to conventional therapy reduces stroke severity, as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale, improves markers of atherosclerosis and inflammation, and reduces triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared with routine therapy as control ( 111698 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the overall low quality of the included studies, with unclear blinding and randomization. Other limitations include significant heterogeneity in patient populations, berberine doses, and treatment durations studied. more Thrombocytopenia. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial for improving platelet counts in people with this condition. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine bisulfate 5 mg three times daily before meals for 15 days, either alone or with prednisolone, can increase platelet count in patients with primary or secondary thrombocytopenia when compared with baseline ( 34317 ). more Trachoma. It is unclear if berberine is beneficial for trachoma when administered as eye drops. Preliminary clinical research shows that berberine ophthalmic solution might be useful for treating trachoma, a common cause of blindness in developing countries. Solutions of 0.2% berberine have been applied three times daily for 3-12 weeks, or solutions of 0.5% three times daily for 1-3 weeks ( 13523 , 34303 , 34310 , 34313 ). more Ulcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral or rectal berberine is beneficial for ulcerative colitis. A meta-analysis of several small, lower quality clinical studies in adults with ulcerative colitis shows that taking berberine orally (600-900 mg daily) or rectally (4-6 grams daily) for 3-12 weeks, in addition to mesalamine, improves the rate of patients with complete remission or reduced symptoms, such as bowel movements, blood in stools, or abdominal pain, when compared to mesalamine alone ( 115724 ). The validity of these findings is limited by heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including route of administration and treatment duration. more Ventricular arrhythmias. Limited research suggests that oral berberine might lower the frequency of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Data from a meta-analysis of 10 small clinical trials, all conducted in China, shows that taking oral berberine, 0.3-0.6 grams 3 or 4 times daily for 7-30 days has a similar efficacy rate to antiarrhythmic drugs, and a lower incidence of adverse effects, in the management of PVCs. A combination of berberine and antiarrhythmic drugs has a higher efficacy rate and similar adverse effect rate, when compared with antiarrhythmic drugs alone ( 112947 ). The quality of this evidence is low. more More evidence is needed to rate berberine for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately. Berberine has been used safely in doses up to 1.5 grams daily for 6 months ( 262 , 13520 , 20579 ) ( 34317 , 34228 , 34247 , 34253 , 34262 , 34263 , 34265 , 34267 , 34277 , 34282 ), ( 34283 , 34286 , 34287 , 34289 , 34293 , 34301 , 34305 , 34306 , 34319 , 34325 )( 99920 , 99921 , 103194 ) or up to 1 gram daily for 24 months ( 99921 , 103197 ). ...when used topically. Berberine ointment has been applied with apparent safety for up to 20 days ( 13526 ). CHILDREN: Likely Unsafe when used orally in newborns. Berberine can cause kernicterus, particularly in preterm neonates with hyperbilirubinemia ( 2589 ). It is unclear if berberine is safe in older children. PREGNANCY: Likely Unsafe when used orally. Berberine is thought to cross the placenta and may cause harm to the fetus. Kernicterus has developed in newborn infants exposed to berberine ( 2589 ). Also, berberine may stimulate uterine contractions ( 91951 ). LACTATION: Likely Unsafe when used orally. Berberine can be transferred to the infant through breast milk ( 2589 ).</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: Berberine has been used in doses of up to 2 grams daily for 8 weeks. It is most often used in doses of 0.4-1.5 grams daily for a duration of 2 weeks to 2 years. In most cases these total daily dosages are divided into 2 or 3 doses throughout the day.

Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, berberine might increase the risk of bleeding when used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. In vitro and in vivo research suggest that berberine can inhibit platelet aggregation ( 33660 , 33694 ). Theoretically, berberine might have additive effects when used with anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs and increase the risk of bleeding. more ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, berberine may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when taken with antidiabetes drugs. Clinical research shows that berberine may lower blood glucose levels ( 20579 , 34247 , 34265 , 34282 , 111363 ). Theoretically, berberine might have additive effects with antidiabetes drugs and increase the risk of hypoglycemia. more ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, berberine might have additive effects with antihypertensive drugs. Animal research suggests that berberine can have hypotensive effects ( 33692 , 34308 ). Also, a clinical study suggests that taking berberine in combination with amlodipine can lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with amlodipine alone ( 91956 ). more CNS DEPRESSANTS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, berberine might increase the sedative effects of CNS depressants. Animal research suggests that berberine may have sedative effects ( 13519 , 33650 , 33664 , 33692 ). Theoretically, use of berberine along with CNS depressants might produce additive therapeutic and adverse effects. more CYCLOSPORINE (Neoral, Sandimmune) Interaction Rating Major Do not take this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence A (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT)) Berberine can increase serum levels of cyclosporine. Berberine can reduce metabolism and increase serum levels of cyclosporine.

Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, berberine might increase serum levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. In vitro research and preliminary clinical evidence show that berberine can inhibit CYP2D6 ( 21117 , 34279 , 34297 ). Theoretically, use of berberine with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 might increase drug levels and increase the risk of adverse effects. more CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence A (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT)) Theoretically, berberine might increase serum levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. In vitro research and preliminary clinical research show that berberine moderately inhibits CYP3A4 ( 13524 , 21114 , 34279 , 34297 ). Theoretically, use of berberine with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 might increase drug levels and increase the risk of adverse effects. more DEXTROMETHORPHAN (Robitussin DM, others) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination.

Preliminary clinical research shows that berberine can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) activity and reduce the metabolism of dextromethorphan ( 34279 ). This may increase the effects and side effects of dextromethorphan. more LOSARTAN (Cozaar) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Berberine might reduce the therapeutic effects of losartan by decreasing its conversion to its active form. Preliminary clinical research suggests that berberine can inhibit cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) activity and reduce metabolism of losartan ( 34279 ). more METFORMIN (Glucophage) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, berberine might increase the therapeutic and adverse effects of metformin. In vitro and animal studies show that berberine can increase the systemic exposure and half-life of metformin, potentially increasing metformin's effects and side effects. This interaction seems to be most apparent when berberine is administered 2 hours prior to metformin. Taking berberine and metformin at the same time does not appear to increase systemic exposure to metformin ( 103195 ). more MIDAZOLAM (Versed) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Berberine can reduce metabolism of midazolam, which might increase the risk of severe adverse effects. Preliminary clinical research shows that berberine can inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) activity and reduce metabolism of midazolam ( 34279 ). more PENTOBARBITAL (Nembutal) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination.

Oral and injectable biotin prevents and treats biotin deficiency. Biotin up to 10 mg daily has been used to treat and prevent biotin deficiency. Injections of biotin 150 mcg daily for 3-5 days have been used in adults. Biotin deficiency might occur due to different etiologies such as inherited biotinidase deficiency, malnutrition, chronic use of anticonvulsants, pregnancy, and excessive and chronic raw egg consumption ( 6243 , 19347 ). A very small study in newborns aged 1-6 months shows that adding biotin to infant formula safely improves biotin status in formula-fed infants. The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of blinding, no randomization, and the small sample size. more Possibly Ineffective Multiple sclerosis (MS). In spite of contrary reports, high-dose biotin (300 mg daily) does not reduce disability in patients with progressive MS. It also does not seem to be linked to an increased risk for relapse. Although most earlier research suggested benefit, the highest quality evidence shows that high-dose biotin does not improve outcomes in progressive MS. A large multi-centered randomized clinical trial (SPI2) in patients with progressive MS and high disability shows that taking biotin 100 mg three times daily for 15 months does not improve disability, as measured on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), or 25-foot walking time, when compared with placebo. The SPI2 clinical trial also did not find that biotin increases the rate of relapse ( 104011 ), a concern raised in one observational study of high-dose biotin ( 104000 ). Also, a large observational study of adults with progressive MS failed to identity an increase in annualized relapse rates in patients that reported taking biotin when compared with controls ( 105716 ). Other observational research has also found no effect on the relapse risk ( 102963 , 102964 ). There is some speculation that any increased rate of relapse identified in some high-dose biotin cohorts might be due to detection bias or reduced compliance with disease-modifying therapies. more Seborrheic dermatitis. Oral biotin doesn't seem to improve seborrheic dermatitis of infancy. A clinical trial in infants with seborrheic dermatitis shows that biotin given by mouth does not improve symptoms when compared with placebo ( 8469 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Alopecia areata. It is unclear if oral biotin is beneficial for alopecia areata. A small clinical study in healthy adults with alopecia areata shows that weekly injections of intramuscular biotin 5 mg/1 mL and dexpanthenol 250 mg/2 mL for 6 weeks reduces hair fall count and transiently increases hair density compared with baseline ( 111366 ). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of a placebo control group, small sample size, and short duration of treatment. It is unclear if the effects are due to biotin, dexpanthenol, or the combination. Another small clinical study in 9-year-old children with alopecia areata shows that taking biotin 20 mg with zinc aspartate 100 mg orally along with topical application of clobetasol propionate 0.025% daily for one year promotes hair regrowth in 33% of children, compared with 0% in the group receiving the steroid deflazacort ( 6932 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to biotin, zinc, topical clobetasol, or the combination. more Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Although there is interest in using oral biotin for ALS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of biotin for this condition. Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease. Adding oral biotin to oral thiamine does not seem to improve most symptoms associated with this condition, although it may slightly speed recovery from acute crisis in children. A small case series in children ages 1-12 years with biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease has found that adding biotin 5 mg/kg daily to thiamine 40 mg/kg daily for 30 months is not associated with additional symptomatic improvement in encephalopathy, seizures, dystonia, or other neurologic sequelae when compared with taking only thiamine. However, taking biotin with thiamine is associated with a 1-day reduction in recovery from acute crisis when compared with thiamine alone ( 95661 ). more Brittle nails. Low quality studies suggest that oral biotin might improve nail thickness and prevent the splitting of brittle nails. Some small, low quality clinical studies in people with brittle nails shows that taking biotin 2.5 mg orally daily for 1.5 to 15 months increases nail thickness and decreases the splitting of fingernails and toenails in some people when compared with baseline ( 171 , 35593 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study sizes and the lack of a comparator group. Biotin has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small retrospective observational study in adults with brittle nails suggests that taking oral biotin 1 mg combined with vitamin B6 100 mg daily for 3 months leads to a complete response rate (&gt;90% improvement) in 70% of participants compared with 10% and 11% with biotin and vitamin B6 alone, respectively, at 6-9 months post-treatment. The validity of these findings is limited by the poor methodology, including lack of blinding and lack of a control group ( 116681 ). more Depression. Although there is interest in using oral biotin for mild depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of biotin for this condition. Diabetes. It is unclear if oral biotin is beneficial for type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials shows that taking biotin 1.5-15 mg orally daily for 1-3 months does not improve fasting blood glucose or serum insulin levels when compared with placebo. However, the validity of these results is limited by inclusion of subjects with and without diabetes ( 110044 ). A very small study in adults with type 2 diabetes also shows that taking biotin 5 mg three times daily for 28 days does not affect glucose or insulin levels when compared to baseline ( 11579 ). Biotin has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. Preliminary clinical research shows that a taking a specific supplement containing a combination of biotin 2 mg and chromium picolinate 600 mcg (Diachrome, Nutrition 21) can lower blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes who are poorly controlled on oral hypoglycemic drugs ( 12385 , 12390 , 15169 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to biotin, chromium, or the combination. more Diabetic neuropathy. Although there is interest in using oral and intramuscular biotin for diabetic neuropathy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of biotin for this condition. Muscle cramps. It is unclear if biotin is beneficial for improving muscle cramps in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Patients undergoing hemodialysis are prone to muscle cramps. A small clinical study in patients with hemodialysis-related muscle cramps shows that taking biotin 1 mg in the morning daily for at least one week prevents and reduces severity of muscle cramps when compared to baseline. Cessation of biotin led to recurrence of cramps, and restarting oral biotin led to resolution of cramps during hemodialysis ( 89475 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of comparator group. more More evidence is needed to rate biotin for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately.

Possibly Safe when used intramuscularly and appropriately ( 8468 , 111366 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Biotin has been safely used at adequate intake doses of 5-25 mcg daily for up to 6 months ( 173 , 6243 , 19347 , 19348 , 111365 ). A tolerable upper intake level (UL) has not been established. PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Biotin has been safely used at the adequate intake (AI) dose of 30 mcg daily during pregnancy and 35 mcg daily during lactation. It has also been used in supplemental doses of up to 300 mcg daily. A tolerable upper intake level (UL) has not been established.</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: There is no recommended dietary allowance (RDA) established for biotin. The adequate intake (AI) for adults over 18 years and during pregnancy is 30 mcg daily. The AI during lactation is 35 mcg daily ( 6243 ). Biotin is most commonly used in doses up to 2.5 mg daily for up to 15 months ( 171 , 35593 ). It has also been used in doses up to 300 mg daily for up to 6 months ( 102965 ). Lab test interactions are more likely to occur with the use of these higher doses. Avidin, a protein in raw egg whites, binds to biotin in the intestine and prevents biotin absorption ( 6243 , 19352 , 19355 ). Eating 2 or more uncooked egg whites daily for several months might cause biotin deficiency. Topical: Biotin, in concentrations ranging from 0.0001% to 0.6%, is included in some commercial cosmetic products . Children Oral: There is no recommended dietary allowance (RDA) established for biotin. The daily adequate intakes (AI) for biotin are 7 mcg for infants 0-12 months, 8 mcg for children 1-3 years, 12 mcg for children 4-8 years, 20 mcg for children 9-13 years, and 25 mcg for adolescents 14-18 years ( 6243 ). Standardization &amp; Formulation There is insufficient reliable information available about the standardization of biotin.</data><data key="mechanism_text">General Biotin is a vitamin that is found in small amounts in numerous foods. In food, biotin is protein bound and is cleaved by the enzyme biotinidase ( 35526 ). Biotin is also synthesized in animals by intestinal microflora. Researchers think biotin is stored in the mitochondria, and that it acts as a coenzyme in bicarbonate-dependent carboxylation reactions ( 6243 ). Biotin-containing enzymes are involved in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, propionate metabolism, and the catabolism of leucine in mammals ( 173 , 19353 ). Pyruvate decarboxylase, a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is a biotin-dependent enzyme ( 35616 ). Decreased activity of this enzyme during biotin deficiency may result in accumulation of pyruvate or decreased aspartate concentration ( 8468 ). Biotin deficiency is difficult to detect because of the lack of assay techniques to determine biotin concentrations in blood ( 8501 ). Symptoms of deficiency include thinning of the hair, frequently with loss of hair color, and red scaly rash around the eyes, nose, and mouth. Neurological symptoms, including depression, lethargy, hallucinations, and paresthesias of the extremities, are also common in biotin deficiency ( 6243 , 35583 , 35600 , 35606 , 35611 ). Biotin deficiency is most likely to occur in people with congenital biotinidase deficiency, malabsorption syndromes, such as short-gut syndrome, during pregnancy, and in people receiving long-term parenteral nutrition ( 6243 , 7878 , 8501 ). There is some evidence that diabetes may produce a biotin-deficient state ( 8468 ). Antidiabetes effects Blood glucose concentrations decrease as plasma and tissue concentrations of biotin increase in people with and without diabetes, but this effect is more dramatic in people with diabetes ( 7880 ). Animal research suggests that biotin reduces blood glucose levels by stimulating the expression of proteins/enzymes that favor hypoglycemia such as insulin, pancreatic glucokinase, and hepatic glucokinase, as well as inhibiting the expression of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (an enzyme that stimulates glucose production) ( 35529 , 35557 ). Carcinogenic effects Laboratory research suggests that biotin might have some mutagenic effects, however this has not been seen in animals or humans. In vitro, biotin induced the expression and activity of cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) in human T lymphocyte (Jurkat) cells, which increased breaks of single-stranded DNA ( 19350 ). Developmental effects Dietary biotin deficiency has been associated with congenital malformations or teratogenicity in animal research ( 35556 ). Laboratory evidence suggests that biotin may be involved in mesenchyme proliferation ( 35556 ). Fertility effects Biotin deficiency has reportedly been associated with delayed spermatogenesis and decreased number of spermatozoa ( 35556 ). Animal research suggests that biotin deficiency is associated with decreased testicular and serum levels of testosterone. Treatment with biotin or biotin in combination with testosterone appears to normalize spermatogenesis in these animals. It is postulated that biotin may be involved in the formation of local testicular factor(s) involved in Leydig, Sertoli, and peritubular cell interactions that occur during spermatogenesis ( 35556 ). Growth effects Biotin appears to improve brittle nails by inducing epidermal differentiation ( 35569 ). Preliminary, low-quality, clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking biotin 2.5 mg by mouth daily for 4 weeks increases nail growth rate by 13% when compared with baseline. Applying minoxidil 5% topical spray twice daily increases nail growth rate more than biotin, but concomitant use of both biotin and minoxidil does not seem to provide further benefit. The validity of these findings is limited by non-randomized treatment allocation ( 105717 ). Hair growth effects In young, healthy males with normal hair growth, taking biotin 5 mg daily orally in combination with minoxidil 5% applied topically for 14 days increases the mean hair growth rate by about 0.3 mm per week when compared to baseline. Using either treatment alone does not increase the hair growth rate. Biotin may act as a cofactor in the hair growth cycle ( 114724 ). Immunomodulating effects Most evidence suggests that biotin deficiency has negative effects on immune function. Cases of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) not associated with adenosine deaminase deficiency have been associated with biotin-dependent carboxylase deficiency ( 35601 ). Also, biotin deficiency has been associated with thymic atrophy, decreased proliferation of spleen cells, reduced antibody synthesis, and delayed rejection of skin allographs ( 35607 ). However, the effects of biotin supplementation on immune function are less consistent. In biotin-deficient animals, treatment with biotin supplements seems to restore immune function ( 35607 ). However, biotin supplementation appears to reduce the activity of interleukins and interferons and decrease the number of lymphocytes when administered to healthy adults ( 7879 ). Lipid-lowering effects Some evidence from animal research suggests that biotin may affect lipid metabolism by decreasing the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC 2), an enzyme that regulates fatty acid oxidation ( 35557 ). Decreasing the activity of ACC 2 appears to increase fatty acid oxidation by decreasing levels of malonyl-CoA. Neurological effects In studies of animals that were not biotin deficient, biotin modulated gene expression in animals and altered astrocyte glucose utilization ( 35546 ). It is postulated that high doses of biotin could improve symptoms of multiple sclerosis by activating the Krebs cycle in demyelinated nerve cells and activating fatty acid synthesis required for myelin synthesis ( 95662 ).</data><data key="name">Biotin</data><data key="scientific_name">Cis-hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno[3,4-d]-imidazole-4-valeric acid</data><data key="overview_text">Biotin is an essential, water-soluble B vitamin also known as vitamin B7. Biotin serves as a cofactor for biotin-dependent carboxylases which participate in fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid catabolism (19353, 89471). In 1942, the role of biotin as an essential vitamin in humans was confirmed by demonstrating biotin deficiency, referred to then as egg-white injury, in human volunteers. This is because raw egg whites contain avidin, which binds to biotin and prevents its absorption</data></node>

Bitter melon contains alkaloids, glycosides, saponins, triterpenes, oils, steroids, sterols, polysaccharides, resins, and proteins ( 92129 , 100630 ). It also contains phenolic and flavonoid compounds, and various vitamins and minerals. The immature fruit provides vitamins A and C, and also contains phosphorus and iron ( 92129 ). It also contains cucurbitane-type triterpene glycosides, including furpyronecucubitane A, goyaglycoside I, charantagenin F, and cucurbitane triterpenoid saponins, including charantagenin E, charantosides D and E, karaviloside III, and karavilagenin B ( 100630 ). Bitter melon also contains MAP30, charantin, vicine, insulin-like peptide, alpha- and beta-momorcharin, momordicin, oleanic acids, and 9-cis,11-trans,13-trans-conjugated linolenic acid ( 37 , 38 , 3724 , 7540 , 15566 , 15568 , 35694 , 35695 , 35696 , 35711 , 35714 , 100633 ). Antineoplastic effects Laboratory research shows that bitter melon juice inhibits proliferation and increases necrotic cell death of gemcitabine-resistant human pancreatic adenocarcinoma AsPC-1 cells by targeting PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling, and enhancing autophagy ( 92128 ). This signaling is involved in developing chemoresistance. Bitter melon may also restrict energy and decrease phosphorylation of components that promote chemoresistance and anti-apoptotic effects. Other antineoplastic effects of bitter melon have been attributed to the reduced expression of growth factor receptors such as the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 (also known as neu or c-erb-2), which has been implicated in breast cancer ( 15568 , 35696 ). Bitter melon might also potentiate function of natural killer cells in cancer patients ( 3722 , 35701 ). In addition, 9-cis,11-trans,13-trans-conjugated linolenic acid extracted from bitter melon seed has shown antineoplastic effects in human colon cancer cell lines and in rats ( 35704 , 35711 ). Laboratory research also shows that bitter melon may inhibit RNA synthesis in human leukemic lymphocytes ( 35718 , 35724 ). Additionally, MAP30, a protein isolated from bitter melon extract appears to possess anti-neoplastic effects, possibly due to reduced expression of growth factor receptors ( 7540 , 15568 , 35694 , 35695 , 35696 ). Animal research shows that bitter melon extract reduces head and neck squamous cell carcinoma growth. This occurs via induction of apoptosis and inhibition of both proliferation of tumor cells and c-Myc expression. C-Myc is a protooncogene, and is involved in cancer cell growth and survival, and is overexpressed in various cancers. BME also modulates regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Regulatory T cells suppress anti-tumor immunity ( 92125 ). Antioxidant effects Laboratory research shows that bitter melon extract prevents lipid peroxidation and free radical generation, and scavenges free radicals ( 92129 ). Phenolic compounds present in bitter melon may be responsible for these effects. Antiplatelet effects An in vitro study and stroke model in rats suggests that protein extracts from bitter melon may have inhibitory effects on platelet activation, adhesion, and aggregation in animal tests or when compared with adenosine diphosphate during in vitro tests ( 112373 ). Antiviral effects Laboratory research attributes bitter melon's antiviral activity to a protein called MAP30, which has been isolated from bitter melon seeds and fruit ( 3720 , 3721 , 7540 , 7542 , 35695 ). MAP30 inhibits HIV and herpes simplex viruses, including acyclovir-resistant strains ( 7539 , 7540 ). It appears to inhibit HIV by inhibiting reverse transcriptase. MAP30 is also a N-glucosidase, which inhibits HIV ribosomal protein synthesis and might make viral and plasmid DNA inactive ( 7542 , 7543 ). MAP30 also seems to inhibit HIV integrase, which prevents integration of viral DNA into the genetic material of healthy cells, and causes irreversible relaxation of supercoiled viral nucleic acids ( 7542 , 35694 ). These changes render viruses unable to integrate into host cell genomes. Another protein, MRK29, found in the seed and fruit of a smaller variety of bitter melon found in Thailand, appears to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase and to increase tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity ( 7541 ). Cardiovascular effects In animals, bitter melon may help to decrease high blood pressure through acetylcholine pathways or through reduction of angiotensin converting enzyme ( 92129 ). Fertility effects Animal research shows that two proteins isolated from the raw fruit of bitter melon possess abortifacient properties ( 3724 , 35719 , 35722 ). In one study, the fertility rate of mice fed with daily bitter melon juice dropped from 90% to 20% ( 35728 ). Additionally, spermatogenesis was inhibited in dogs fed a bitter melon fruit extract for 60 days ( 35723 ). Hepatoprotective effects Bitter melon may be hepatoprotective due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects ( 92129 ). In animals, bitter melon appears to improve liver enzymes after carbon tetrachloride or ammonium chloride-induced liver damage, and to increase levels of antioxidants ( 92129 ). In animals, bitter melon may also downregulate factors contributing to development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In vitro studies suggest that karaviloside III and some other compounds in bitter melon inhibit development of hepatic fibrosis and also have activity against liver cancer cell lines ( 100630 ). Hormonal effects Animal research shows that an ethanolic extract of bitter melon seed has antispermatogenic effects and androgenic properties ( 7538 ). Hypoglycemic effects Bitter melon fruit, seed, and leaf extracts have demonstrated hypoglycemic activity in humans and animal models of diabetes ( 34 , 35 , 36 , 3762 , 3763 , 3764 , 3765 , 7700 , 8179 , 15566 , 92124 , 92126 , 92129 ). Preliminary evidence suggests that bitter melon decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis, increases hepatic glycogen synthesis, increases pancreatic insulin secretion, increases peripheral glucose oxidation in erythrocytes and adipocytes, and increases glucose uptake into skeletal muscle ( 12697 , 15568 , 35715 , 35716 , 35717 , 35720 , 92124 , 92126 , 92129 , 106408 ). Bitter melon fruit extract might also protect against hyperinsulinemia ( 7700 ). Bitter melon contains an insulin-like polypeptide called polypeptide P, plant insulin, or p-insulin. P-insulin seems to have pharmacologic effects similar to bovine insulin with an onset of action between 30 and 60 minutes, and a peak effect at about four hours ( 37 , 38 ). Other components of bitter melon reported to have hypoglycemic activity are charantin, which is a mixture of two steroid glycosides, and vicine ( 15566 , 15568 , 92124 ). Bitter melon also seems to increase the muscle content of the insulin-regulated glucose transporter, GLUT4 ( 92126 , 92129 ). Research in animal models shows that an aqueous extract of bitter melon fruit can slow the progression of microalbuminuria and diabetic nephropathy ( 8179 ). Hypolipidemic effects Animal research shows that bitter melon can decrease triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ( 35703 , 35705 , 92129 ). Laboratory research shows that bitter melon decreases accumulation of lipids and inhibits preadipocyte differentiation. It also downregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), which regulates adipogenesis, as well as decreases other adipogenic factors ( 92129 ). Bitter melon appears to have actions in the pancreas, liver, and fat cells ( 92129 ). It decreases ApoB secretion and alters phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. It also increases components that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and energy demand, leading to increased lipid metabolism and utilization. It also affects levels of mRNA of enzymes that are involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism ( 35706 , 35710 , 92129 ). Flavonoids and saponins may be responsible for these effects ( 8180 , 92129 ). Immunomodulatory effects Constituents of bitter melon called alpha- and beta-momorcharin have immunosuppressive activity in laboratory and animal research. They inhibit mitogenic responses of mouse splenocytes at non-cytotoxic concentrations. They also decrease the functional capacity of macrophages, as well as suppressing the cytotoxic lymphocyte response ( 3724 ). Weight loss effects In animals with diet-induced obesity, bitter melon can reduce body weight by increasing fatty acid oxidation ( 92129 ). Polysaccharides from fermented bitter melon juice decrease body weight in rats fed a high-fat diet, and this is associated with a decrease in the size of fat cells in adipose tissue ( 100629 ). Additionally, bitter melon increases carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-1), an enzyme that transports fatty acids into the mitochondria. It also increases uncoupling proteins and expression of regulators of lipid oxidation, which suggests that bitter melon has an effect on energy expenditure. Also in animals, bitter melon lowers mRNA levels of enzymes required for fatty acid synthesis ( 92129 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Possibly Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Bitter%20Melon</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Amenorrhea. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for amenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Athletic performance. It is unclear if oral bitter melon is beneficial for improving athletic performance. Preliminary clinical research in ten male tennis players taking part in high-intensity training at high temperatures shows that taking bitter melon extract orally, 100 mL six times daily for 4 weeks, improves some biomarkers of fatigue and physical fitness parameters including balance, flexibility, and cardiorespiratory fitness when compared with baseline. Levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone and cortisol are decreased, suggesting a reduction in oxidative stress ( 103295 , 106407 ). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Constipation. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for constipation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this purpose. Diabetes. Although some research suggests that bitter melon may improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes, evidence is conflicting and of limited quality. A meta-analysis of 10 low-quality studies in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking bitter melon powdered whole fruits or juice in doses of 0.5 to 12 grams daily for 4-16 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose (FBG) by 13 mg/dL, postprandial glucose by 26 mg/dL, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.26% when compared with placebo ( 100632 ). Another meta-analysis, pooling the results of 7 trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, shows that bitter melon modestly reduces HbA1c by 0.3% and FBG by 14 mg/dL when compared with no treatment, but a separate analysis of 2 other trials shows that bitter melon does not improve either outcome when compared with oral antidiabetic drugs ( 111503 ). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 3 clinical trials shows that taking bitter melon 1-6 grams daily for 4-12 weeks does not significantly improve fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c when compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 92124 ). Some other clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that bitter melon fruit, fruit pulp, fruit juice, and extract improve glucose tolerance and insulin secretion, reduce blood glucose levels, and lower HbA1c ( 34 , 35 , 36 , 38 , 12530 ). One clinical study shows that taking powdered bitter melon fruit 2-4 grams daily for 10 weeks lowers HbA1c similarly to glyburide 2.5 mg daily ( 92126 ). Reasons for the discrepancies among the evidence are not clear but may relate to the small study sizes, shorter durations of treatment, and varying dosages and formulations of bitter melon. more Dyspepsia. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for dyspepsia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this purpose. Genital herpes. Although there is interest in using topical bitter melon for genital herpes, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. HIV/AIDS. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral bitter melon is beneficial in patients with prediabetes. A small clinical study in patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that drinking a beverage containing bitter melon extract 1.25-3 grams as a single dose does not affect blood glucose or insulin response when compared with baseline ( 97508 ). A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with prediabetes shows that taking bitter melon (SugarKatcherS52, Kolmar BNH) 800 mg three times daily for 12 weeks reduces blood glucose by 22 mg/dL two hours after oral glucose tolerance test when compared with placebo, but does not improve insulin, C-peptide, or glucagon levels, nor markers of insulin resistance ( 112372 ). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons which can lead studies to erroneously show differences between treatment groups (i.e., false positive findings). more Intestinal parasite infection. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for intestinal parasite infection, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for kidney stones, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Liver disease. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for liver disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Metabolic syndrome. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for metabolic syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Obesity. It is unclear if oral bitter melon is beneficial for weight loss. A very small clinical study in patients with obesity shows that taking bitter melon 1 gram twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, or body fat percentage when compared to baseline. However, when compared with placebo, body weight and BMI were reduced by around 4 kg and 1.6 kg/m 2 , respectively. Patients in the placebo group experienced an increase in these measures ( 109583 ). more Osteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral bitter melon is beneficial in patients with osteoarthritis. A small preliminary clinical study in patients with osteoarthritis shows that taking bitter melon 1500 mg three times daily for 3 months reduces the need for rescue analgesic medications when compared with placebo. However, subjective scores of osteoarthritis symptoms improved similarly in both groups ( 100631 ). more Peptic ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for PCOS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Psoriasis. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for psoriasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Ulcerative colitis. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for ulcerative colitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Wound healing. Although there is interest in using topical bitter melon for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this purpose. More evidence is needed to rate bitter melon for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Possibly Safe when the fruit is used orally and appropriately, short-term. Powdered bitter melon fruit 0.5-12 grams daily for up to 4 months has been used ( 92126 , 100631 , 100632 , 109583 ). Extracts of bitter melon fruit have also been used safely for up to 3 months ( 36 , 15566 , 106408 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about long-term use of bitter melon or the safety of bitter melon when used topically. PREGNANCY: Possibly Unsafe when used orally. Animal research shows that two proteins isolated from the raw fruit of bitter melon possess abortifacient properties ( 3724 , 35719 , 35722 , 35728 ). Also, one animal study shows that bitter melon juice significantly reduces the fertility rate of mice ( 35728 ). However, these effects of bitter melon have not been assessed in humans.

Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Taking bitter melon with antidiabetes drugs might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Bitter melon can lower blood glucose levels and might have additive effects when used with antidiabetes drugs ( 34 , 35 , 36 , 38 , 8181 , 12530 , 92124 , 92126 , 92129 , 100632 , 111503 ). This might increase the risk of hypoglycemia in some patients. Monitor blood glucose levels closely. more P-GLYCOPROTEIN SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, bitter melon might increase levels of P-glycoprotein substrates. Bitter melon might inhibit the p-glycoprotein (P-gp) intestinal pump and increase intracellular levels of P-gp substrates. In vitro research in intestinal cells shows that 1-monopalmitin, a constituent of bitter melon, increases levels of daunomycin, a P-gp substrate ( 97509 ). Additionally, drinking bitter melon juice has been associated with a case of acute pancreatitis in a patient who had been taking pazopanib, a P-gp substrate, for 8 years. Researchers theorize that inhibition of P-gp led to increased levels of pazopanib, resulting in pazopanib-induced pancreatitis ( 109581 ). more PAZOPANIB (Votrient) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, bitter melon might increase levels of pazopanib, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects. In one case, a 65-year-old patient taking pazopanib for 8 years for renal cell carcinoma experienced signs and symptoms consistent with acute pancreatitis 4 days after drinking bitter melon juice at a dose of 100-150 mL daily. The patient's symptoms, amylase levels, and lipase levels improved upon discontinuation of bitter melon and pazopanib. Pazopanib treatment was re-initiated with no further evidence of pancreatitis. Researchers theorize that inhibition of P-glycoprotein by bitter melon led to increased levels of pazopanib, a P-glycoprotein substrate, resulting in pazopanib-induced pancreatitis ( 109581 ). more</data><data key="name">Bitter Melon</data><data key="scientific_name">Momordica charantia (synonym: Momordica murcata)</data><data key="overview_text">Bitter melon is an annual climbing vine that grows in India, Asia, East Africa, South America, and the Caribbean.

The activity of chromium depends on its valance state. Metallic chromium, or chromium 0, has no activity. The other two common forms, chromium III (Cr III) and chromium VI (Cr VI), have different activities. Cr VI is typically used in chemical and welding industries and is carcinogenic to humans. Cr III is the form found in foods and supplements ( 13721 ). Chromium is sometimes referred to as glucose tolerance factor (GTF), but GTF is actually a complex of molecules found in the body that includes chromium bound to single molecules of glycine, cysteine, glutamic acid, and two molecules of nicotinic acid. Chromium is thought to be the active component of the complex. Some dietary sources of chromium include canned foods (due to chromium leaching from the can), meats and animal fats, fish, brown sugar, coffee, tea, some spices, calf liver, whole wheat bread, rye bread, and brewer's yeast ( 7061 ). Symptomatic chromium deficiency is rare. When it does occur, it is most often due to malnutrition, pregnancy, stress, or long-term use of chromium deficient total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Symptoms include severe glucose intolerance, weight loss, and metabolic encephalopathy ( 6863 , 13730 ). Although not yet confirmed, some researchers suspect that tissue levels of chromium might decline with age ( 6863 ). Antidiabetes effects People with diabetes may have lower chromium levels ( 7058 , 11908 , 13725 ). Low chromium levels are associated with impaired glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism, and resultant increased cardiovascular risk ( 95097 ). Some athletes might also be at risk for low chromium levels since strenuous aerobic exercise seems to increase urinary excretion of chromium ( 6860 , 6861 ). However, exercise-induced losses seem to be less in those who regularly exercise ( 6862 ). People who strength train seem to have increased absorption of chromium ( 7136 ). It is difficult to measure chromium status to determine who might require supplementation. Blood chromium levels are not in equilibrium with chromium stores and, therefore, do not provide a good indicator of chromium status ( 6859 ). However, elevated blood chromium levels may indicate excessive chromium exposure ( 11786 ). Levels in the urine and hair do not reflect overall chromium status ( 6867 ). There is no reliable method available to diagnose chromium deficiency, other than observing the outcome following supplementation in patients suspected of being deficient ( 3859 , 6869 ). Symptoms of chromium deficiency can include impaired insulin function and glucose tolerance, leading to elevations in insulin and fasting hyperglycemia, impairments in growth, increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides, neuropathy, weight loss, decreased respiratory function, and nitrogen metabolism abnormalities ( 6863 , 6869 , 11786 , 95098 ). Discovery of the role of chromium in insulin function occurred when patients on long-term TPN developed symptoms of diabetes that did not respond to insulin, but were reversed by chromium ( 6869 , 42641 , 42787 ). Because of the symptoms associated with chromium deficiency, researchers have speculated that chromium supplementation might be an effective treatment for diabetes. There is some evidence that patients with diabetes might have lower than normal levels of chromium due to increased chromium excretion ( 6858 ). However, patients with diabetes also seem to have increased gastrointestinal absorption of chromium. It's also theorized that patients with diabetes may not be able to adequately convert chromium from the diet to a usable form in the body ( 6867 ). Chromium seems to be transported to insulin-sensitive cells by transferrin, in response to increases in plasma insulin levels ( 6869 ). It is suspected to potentiate insulin by increasing receptor numbers and affinity, and increasing insulin binding to cells ( 6859 , 6867 ). Chromium increases insulin sensitivity through activation of signaling pathways involved with glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), leading to translocation ( 95097 ). Chromium may also enhance the synthesis of insulin receptor mRNA as well as insulin-like growth factor receptors ( 95097 ). A single oral dose of chromium before a high carbohydrate meal seems to lessen postprandial hyperglycemia in healthy, young volunteers. This suggests chromium potentiates the effect of insulin ( 13726 ). Additionally, chromium picolinate has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and stimulate insulin receptor sites in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 42554 ). Other clinical research shows that chromium dinicocysteinate can reduce insulin resistance by reducing oxidative stress and blood levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 42707 ). However, chromium picolinate does not appear to have these effects. In animal models, a chromium-containing peptide called chromodulin has been identified, which potentiates the actions of insulin at its receptors, including activation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity ( 6869 ). Additionally, in laboratory study, chromium activated trafficking of glucose transporter-4 and increased insulin-stimulated glucose transport through a cholesterol-dependent mechanism ( 42602 ). In patients with diabetes, these actions seem to translate into decreased insulin resistance, improved glucose tolerance, and lower blood glucose levels ( 6862 ). Researchers are interested in chromium for treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome due to its potential effects on lipids and body composition. Some clinical research shows that chromium might reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, and thereby some of the adverse effects and complications of diabetes ( 13724 ). A meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults, most of whom have diabetes, shows that chromium supplementation is associated with modest reductions in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and TNF-alpha when compared with control ( 105030 ). But the clinical significance of this is not known. Clinical research suggests that adding 100 mg of nicotinic acid 200 mcg of chromium chloride significantly improves glucose metabolism ( 11687 ); the effects of chromium may be augmented by nicotinic acid. Antioxidant effects Chromium is considered to have antioxidant effects ( 13724 , 42785 ). In human research, chromium dinicocysteinate supplementation significantly lowered protein carbonyl levels, a marker of protein oxidation, from baseline in diabetic patients ( 42707 ). Another study in diabetic patients reported an improvement in plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) ( 30863 ). In patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, chromium lowered levels of malondialdehyde ( 98687 ). A meta-analysis of patients with diabetes and other chronic disorders shows that taking chromium 400-1000 mcg daily for 8-24 weeks improves some markers of oxidative stress, such as malondialdehyde levels, when compared with control; however other markers, such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels, were not improved ( 110608 ). Some clinical research also shows that chromium might reduce oxidative stress in patients with diabetes; however, in patients without diabetes, chromium might act as a pro-oxidant ( 13724 ). Bone-resorption effects In vitro evidence suggests that chromium extract may increase the release of bone-resorbing cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus, when used as an alloying element in metallic implants, chromium may increase tissue damage and bone resorption surrounding a metallic implant ( 42784 ). Genetic effects Although laboratory studies have shown that trivalent chromium compounds can produce chromosome or DNA oxidative damage, human studies have not demonstrated these findings ( 42790 ). On the other hand, hexavalent chromium penetrates the cells easily (unlike trivalent chromium) and appears to induce oxidative damage to DNA ( 7326 , 42565 , 42749 , 42778 ). Growth effects There is interest in using chromium to enhance muscle protein synthesis. In the presence of sufficient essential amino acids or protein, insulin stimulates muscle protein synthesis. With low amounts of essential amino acids, insulin inhibits protein breakdown and has minimal effects on the rate of muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, it has been speculated that an improvement in insulin signaling combined with adequate doses of essential amino acids, could affect muscle protein synthesis ( 95099 ). Chromium is hypothesized to increase muscle mass by increasing amino acid uptake into muscle cells via potentiation of insulin activity ( 6862 , 42813 ). Laboratory research suggests that chromium picolinate increases internalization of insulin and increases leucine uptake in muscle cells. Because of its effects on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) translocation, and its ability to increase insulin response through the AMPK pathway, chromium has been used in clinical research to improve muscle protein synthesis. In one small clinical study in healthy young adults, taking a suboptimal dose of whey protein isolate (BiPro USA) 6 grams and a combination product containing chromium picolinate/histidinate and amylopectin (Velositol, Nutrition 21, LLC) 2 grams, followed by acute resistance exercise, significantly increased the muscle fractional synthesis rate compared to whey protein alone ( 95099 ). Also, evidence from animal research suggests that chromium supplementation can increase growth rate in mice and rats ( 42733 ). Immunomodulating effects In vitro evidence suggests that chromium extract reduces cell proliferation and inhibits interleukin (IL)-2-dependent response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to phytohemagglutinin. Thus, when used as an alloying element in metallic implants, chromium may reduce lymphocyte-mediated immune response to an infection that develops in tissue surrounding a metallic implant ( 42784 ). Lipid effects Chromium inhibits the hepatic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase leading to interference of cholesterol metabolism ( 95097 ). Neurologic effects It is theorized that chromium might enhance glucose utilization in the brain and stimulate norepinephrine release ( 2659 ). There is also interest in using chromium as an adjunct to antidepressant medications in people with depression. Preliminary clinical research suggests that chromium decreases endocrine responses to serotonin receptor stimulation, which could produce antidepressant activity ( 8929 ). A case series of adults with persistent depressive disorder shows that chromium supplementation might improve response to antidepressants, such as sertraline and amitriptyline, in patients with inadequate response ( 2659 ). However, clinical research in patients with atypical depression has yielded conflicting results ( 10309 , 42600 ). Weight loss effects Clinical research shows that ingestion of chromium picolinate reduces fat cravings, food intake, and hunger, which may lead to weight loss ( 42634 ). Chromium may induce these effects by affecting the brain's hunger receptors. Some research suggests that chromium might sensitize insulin-sensitive glucoreceptors in the brain, resulting in appetite suppression, activation of the sympathetic nervous system, stimulation of thermogenesis, and down-regulation of insulin secretion ( 6170 , 6860 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Likely Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Chromium</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Likely Effective Chromium deficiency. Oral or parenteral chromium is effective for the treatment and prevention of chromium deficiency. Chromium is effective for preventing and treating symptoms of chromium deficiency, including hyperglycemia, glycosuria, sudden weight loss, peripheral neuropathy, and confusion ( 7135 ). more Possibly Effective Diabetes. Oral chromium seems to be modestly beneficial for improving glycemic control in diabetes, especially when used in doses greater than 200 mcg daily and in patients with poorly controlled diabetes. It is unclear if chromium helps to prevent the development of diabetes. Epidemiological research has found that lower toenail chromium levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease ( 11908 ). In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed a qualified health claim stating that chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the FDA has determined that any relationship between chromium picolinate and type 2 diabetes is highly uncertain and is based on limited scientific evidence ( 102362 ). Research on the use of chromium for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is conflicting but seems to show modest benefit in some patients. Several clinical studies, most including fewer than 80 patients with type 2 diabetes, show that taking chromium decreases fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and increases insulin sensitivity ( 6867 , 7137 , 12390 , 14440 , 15169 , 42628 , 42638 , 95097 , 103745 ). However, other small clinical studies show that chromium is no better than placebo for improving most glycemic indices in patients with diabetes ( 7060 , 14325 , 42679 , 42707 , 90059 , 103746 , 103749 ). Some of these studies may not have been adequately powered and some had a high risk of bias. Furthermore, these studies had high heterogeneity related to study population and size, chromium supplementation duration, formulation, and dose, and accepted standards of diabetes care. Multiple meta-analyses pooling results of these small clinical trials also show mixed results ( 90055 , 90063 , 95098 , 105026 , 110610 , 111420 ). The most recent of the aforementioned meta-analyses show that chromium picolinate lowers HbA1c by about 0.6%, with conflicting findings related to fasting blood glucose and measures of insulin resistance ( 110610 , 111420 ). It is unclear if chromium yeast, chromium dinicocysteinate, or chromium with biotin or other natural ingredients are beneficial. Chromium seems to be most beneficial in doses of greater than 200 mcg taken for 12 weeks or longer, and in patients with poorly controlled diabetes with a baseline HbA1c of 8% or greater ( 90063 , 105026 ). There is also speculation that chromium might primarily benefit patients with low chromium levels; however, there has not been an analysis specifically evaluating this population ( 6867 , 7058 , 13725 , 14325 , 95098 ). Some research suggests that chromium might also modestly improve lipid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 1934 , 6867 , 95098 ). A meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 42-1000 mcg daily for 5-26 weeks decreases triglyceride levels by 7 mg/dL and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 2 mg/dL when compared with control. Taking chromium did not affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, the validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity ( 110605 ). Another meta-analysis failed to demonstrate any effects of chromium on lipid levels ( 110610 ). Research on chromium's effect on blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes is mixed. A meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 200-1000 mcg daily for 8-25 weeks lowers diastolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg, but does not improve systolic blood pressure or body mass index, when compared with placebo ( 110607 ). Preliminary clinical research shows that chromium picolinate might improve metabolic parameters in patients with other forms of diabetes as well. This includes those with type 1 diabetes ( 1935 ), diabetes secondary to corticosteroid use ( 5039 , 42829 ), and gestational diabetes ( 42817 ). more Possibly Ineffective Hypertension. Meta-analyses of small clinical trials suggest that oral chromium does not lower blood pressure by a clinically meaningful amount. A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in adults with different metabolic disorders shows that taking chromium 42-1000 mcg daily for 12-24 weeks does not lower systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo ( 110609 ). A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in adults with different chronic disorders shows that taking chromium 42-1000 mcg daily for 4-25 weeks lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 3 mmHg and 1 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo. However, the validity of this meta-analysis is limited by high heterogeneity ( 110604 ). Another meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials including patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 200-1000 mcg daily for 8-25 weeks lowers diastolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg, but not systolic blood pressure, when compared with placebo ( 110607 ). In addition, the validity of these results is limited by inclusion of patients with and without hypertension at baseline ( 110604 , 110607 , 110609 ). more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Oral chromium does not seem to improve glycemic indices in patients with prediabetes. Some clinical research shows that adults with impaired glucose tolerance do not have improved glycemic parameters or insulin sensitivity after taking chromium picolinate 500-1000 mcg daily for up to 6 months when compared with placebo ( 13053 , 42670 ). Likewise, a small clinical study in elderly patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that chromium supplements do not improve glucose tolerance or triglyceride or cholesterol levels when compared with placebo ( 13722 ). Finally, a preliminary clinical study in overweight or obese adults with prediabetes shows that taking two capsules of a combination product containing chromium, cinnamon, and carnosine (Glycabiane, PiLeJe) daily for 4 months decreases fasting plasma glucose by approximately 4 mg/dL when compared with placebo, but does not improve fasting plasma insulin, measures of insulin sensitivity or resistance, or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) ( 94234 ). The small effect on fasting plasma glucose is clinically insignificant and may be due to the other ingredients in this product. more Schizophrenia. Oral chromium does not seem to improve psychological measures in patients with schizophrenia. Clinical research in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking chromium polynicotinate 400 mcg daily for 3 months does not affect weight or mental status when compared with placebo ( 42613 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Antiretroviral-induced insulin resistance. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial for preventing antiretroviral-induced insulin resistance. Preliminary clinical research in patients with HIV treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) shows that taking chromium nicotinate 200 mcg or chromium picolinate 1000 mcg daily for 8-16 weeks may help decrease insulin resistance and increase glucose disposal when compared to baseline ( 42630 , 42662 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. more Athletic performance. It is unclear if chromium enhances athletic performance, although some research suggests that it may improve body composition when used in conjunction with exercise. One large clinical study shows taking chromium 400 mcg daily, in conjunction with resistance training, can increase weight loss, body fat loss, and lean body mass when compared with placebo in conjunction with resistance training ( 6868 ). However, other, very small clinical studies show that adding chromium picolinate or chromium chloride 177-400 mcg daily to a weight-training program does not improve body composition when compared with weight-training alone ( 6860 , 6861 , 6862 , 42747 ). These studies may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference in outcomes. more Atypical depression. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with atypical depression. Preliminary clinical research in patients with atypical depression shows that taking chromium picolinate 400 mcg daily for 2 weeks followed by 600 mcg daily for an additional 6 weeks improves response and remission rates when compared with placebo ( 10309 ). However, other clinical research shows that taking elemental chromium 400 mcg in the form of chromium picolinate daily for 2 weeks followed by 600 mcg daily for an additional 6 weeks does not improve most symptoms of atypical depression, although appetite and sexual drive may improve, when compared with placebo ( 42600 ). more Beta blocker-induced dyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with dyslipidemia due to beta-blocker use. One small clinical study in patients who take beta-blockers shows that taking glucose tolerance factor (GTF)-chromium 600 mcg daily for 2 months increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by 16%, but does not affect other lipid parameters, when compared with placebo ( 5040 ). more Binge eating disorder. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with binge eating disorder. One small clinical study in adults with overweight and binge eating disorder shows that taking chromium picolinate 600 or 1000 mcg daily for 6 months does not affect binge eating frequency, body weight, or depressive symptoms when compared with placebo ( 90057 ). more Bipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar disorder. Preliminary clinical research in patients with treatment-resistant, rapid-cycling bipolar disorder shows that taking chromium chloride (Hypo-A Chrom, Hypo-A GmbH) 600-800 mcg daily for up to 2 years can decrease the frequency of affective episodes by approximately three episodes annually when compared to baseline ( 42618 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. more Cognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral chromium prevents or treats cognitive impairment. Some clinical research shows that taking chromium picolinate standardized to contain elemental chromium 1000 mcg daily for 12 weeks does not improve memory or depression in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment when compared with placebo. However, results from neuroimaging scans suggest that chromium increases the activity of certain regions of the brain during memory tasks when compared with placebo ( 42666 ). more Hyperlipidemia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral chromium may modestly reduce lipid levels in patients with hyperlipidemia. One small clinical study in patients with atherosclerotic disease shows that taking chromium 250 mcg as chromium chloride daily for 7-16 months decreases triglycerides and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, but not other lipid parameters, when compared with placebo ( 7060 ). Other small clinical studies in adults with hyperlipidemia show that taking chromium picolinate 200 mcg daily for 6 weeks, chromium polynicotinate 200 mcg twice daily, or brewer's yeast containing 48 mcg elemental chromium daily for 6-8 weeks decrease total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared to baseline ( 37178 , 42585 , 42710 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of comparison with a control group. A meta-analysis of small heterogeneous clinical studies in patients mostly without hyperlipidemia shows that taking chromium does not affect lipid levels when compared with placebo ( 105029 ). A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials including patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 42-1000 mcg daily for 5-26 weeks modestly improves triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels, but not LDL cholesterol levels, when compared with control. However, the validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity and inclusion of patients with and without hyperlipidemia ( 110605 ). In addition, some meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate any effects of chromium on lipid levels in adults with diabetes ( 110610 ). Limited research has tested high-dose chromium in children. One small clinical study in children with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking chromium polynicotinate 400-600 mcg with glucomannan 1000-1500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces total and LDL cholesterol when compared to baseline ( 90061 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to chromium, glucomannan, or the combination. more Hypoglycemia. It is unclear if oral chromium helps to reverse or prevent hypoglycemia. One very small clinical study in patients with reactive hypoglycemia shows that taking chromium chloride 200 mcg daily for 3 months increases blood glucose levels and improves insulin binding and hypoglycemic symptoms following an oral glucose load ( 6859 ). Another small clinical study in patients with symptomatic hypoglycemia shows that taking chromium yeast (Biochrome, Pharma-Nord) 125 mcg daily for 3 months improves symptoms, including chilliness, trembling, and disorientation, when compared with baseline ( 42711 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome. One small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a particular chromium picolinate product (Chromax, Nutrition 21) 500 mcg twice daily for 16 weeks does not affect weight, waist circumference, insulin sensitivity, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), or lipid levels when compared with placebo ( 42654 ). more Myocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if oral chromium helps to prevent MI. Epidemiological research has found that low toenail chromium concentrations are associated with an increased risk of MI ( 13728 ). However, toenail chromium concentrations might not be a reliable predictor of body stores of chromium. There is also no reliable research showing that chromium supplements can prevent MI. more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral chromium slows NAFLD progression. One small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking chromium picolinate 200 mcg two times daily after meals for 12 weeks does not affect liver enzyme levels or body weight when compared with placebo ( 105027 ). more Obesity. Although some research suggests that oral chromium may increase weight loss, this increase in weight loss is not likely to be considered clinically relevant. Meta-analyses of clinical studies in adults with overweight or obesity show that taking chromium picolinate 200-1000 mcg daily for 12-16 weeks might result in a cumulative weight loss of about 0.5-1 kg when compared with placebo ( 90062 , 90065 ). However, this small reduction in weight is unlikely to be considered clinically significant. Additionally, small clinical studies in healthy adults and children with overweight or obesity show that taking oral chromium 200-1000 mcg daily for 6-24 weeks does not reduce weight when compared with control ( 6860 , 13727 , 17224 , 42680 ). Some of these studies may not have been adequately powered to detect a smaller effect. A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials among adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 200-1000 mcg daily for 8-25 weeks does not lower body mass index when compared with placebo. However, the validity of these results is limited by inclusion of patients with and without obesity at baseline ( 110607 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral chromium improves symptoms of PCOS. One small clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking chromium picolinate 1000 mcg daily for 6 months along with diet and exercise counseling decreases body mass index and improves rates of ovulation and regular menstruation when compared with placebo ( 95094 ). Also, some clinical research shows that taking chromium picolinate (21st Century HealthCare, Inc. or Nature Made) 200 mcg daily for 8 weeks increases insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo ( 95095 , 98687 ). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking chromium picolinate 200 mcg daily for 4 months does not affect insulin sensitivity or improve ovulation rates ( 42603 ). Although chromium picolinate at doses of less than 1000 mcg might have very small effects on fasting glucose, these doses do not seem to have clinically beneficial effects on fasting glucose, pregnancy rate, or testosterone levels ( 95094 , 95095 , 98687 ). A lower dose of chromium has also been studied in combination with carnitine. One small clinical study in adults with overweight and PCOS shows that taking chromium picolinate 200 mcg daily with carnitine 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and body weight, and slightly increases insulin sensitivity, when compared with placebo ( 103747 ). However, it is unclear if this benefit is clinically significant. Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to chromium, carnitine, or the combination. Carnitine has demonstrated clinical benefit when used alone in PCOS. more Turner syndrome. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with this condition. A small clinical study shows that taking brewer's yeast 30 grams containing chromium 50 mcg daily for 8 weeks might improve abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism when compared with baseline in patients with Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder that has a high incidence of diabetes ( 13729 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more More evidence is needed to rate chromium for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts, short-term. Chromium has been safely used in doses up to 1000 mcg daily for up to 6 months ( 1934 , 5039 , 5040 , 6858 , 6859 , 6860 , 6861 , 6862 , 6867 , 6868 )( 7135 , 7137 , 10309 , 13053 , 14325 , 14440 , 17224 , 90057 , 90061 )( 90063 , 94234 , 95095 , 95096 , 95097 , 98687 ); however, most of these studies have used chromium doses in a range of 150-600 mcg. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Institute of Medicine (IOM) evaluations of the safety of chromium suggest that it is safe when used in doses of 200 mcg daily for up to 6 months ( 13241 , 13242 ). Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts, long-term. Chromium has been safely used in a small number of studies at doses of 200-1000 mcg daily for up to 2 years ( 7060 , 7135 , 42618 , 42628 , 42666 , 110605 , 110607 , 110609 ). However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Institute of Medicine (IOM) evaluations of the safety of chromium suggest that it is safe when used in doses of 200 mcg daily for up to 6 months ( 13241 , 13242 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately in amounts not exceeding the daily adequate intake (AI) levels by age: 0-6 months, 0.2 mcg; 7-12 months, 5.5 mcg; 1-3 years, 11 mcg; 4-8 years, 15 mcg; males 9-13 years, 25 mcg; males 14-18 years, 35 mcg; females 9-13 years, 21 mcg; females 14-18 years, 24 mcg ( 7135 ). POSSIBLY SAFE...when used orally and appropriately in amounts exceeding AI levels. Chromium 400 mcg daily has been used safely for up to 6 weeks ( 42680 ). PREGNANCY: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately in amounts not exceeding adequate intake (AI) levels. The AI for pregnancy is 28 mcg daily for those 14-18 years of age and 30 mcg daily for those 19-50 years of age ( 7135 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Safe when used orally in amounts exceeding the adequate intake (AI) levels. There is some evidence that patients with gestational diabetes can safely use chromium in doses of 4-8 mcg/kg ( 1953 ); however, patients should not take chromium supplements during pregnancy without medical supervision. LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately in amounts not exceeding adequate intake (AI) levels. The AI for lactation is 44 mcg daily for those 14-18 years of age and 45 mcg daily for those 19-50 years of age ( 7135 ). Chromium supplements do not seem to increase normal chromium concentration in human breast milk ( 1937 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of chromium when used in higher amounts while breast-feeding.</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: General : There is insufficient information to establish safe and tolerable upper intake levels for chromium ( 7135 ). However, daily adequate intake (AI) levels for chromium have been established: males 19-50 years, 35 mcg; males 51 and older, 30 mcg; females 19-50 years, 25 mcg; females 51 and older, 20 mcg. During pregnancy: 14-18 years, 29 mcg; 19-50 years, 30 mcg. When lactating: 14-18 years, 44 mcg; 19-50 years, 45 mcg. Sometimes chromium amounts are listed in micromols. The conversion factor to mcg is: 1.92 micromol = 100 mcg ( 6867 ). Chromium has been used in various salt forms and at various doses. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Children Oral: General : There is insufficient information to establish safe and tolerable upper intake levels for chromium ( 7135 ). However, daily adequate intake (AI) levels for chromium have been established by age: 0-6 months, 0.2 mcg; 7-12 months, 5.5 mcg; 1-3 years, 11 mcg; 4-8 years, 15 mcg; males 9-13 years, 25 mcg; females 9-13 years, 21 mcg; males 14-18 years, 35 mcg; females 14-18 years, 24 mcg ( 6867 , 42580 ). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization &amp; Formulation Chromium chloride is the natural form of trivalent chromium ( 95098 ). The most common chromium salt used in supplements is the synthetic chromium picolinate. Other chromium salts used include chromium chloride and chromium polynicotinate ( 2659 , 95098 ). Chromium may also come in the form of brewer's yeast or chromium yeast ( 95098 ). Chromium picolinate is a complex of chromium and picolinic acid, which is a naturally occurring metabolic derivative of tryptophan. It contains 12.4% elemental trivalent chromium ( 2659 , 95094 ). Chromium polynicotinate is often referred to as niacin-bound chromium because it includes chromium bound to molecules of niacin ( 2659 ).</data><data key="interactions_text">Expand All | Collapse All ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence A (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT)) Theoretically, chromium may have additive effects with antidiabetic agents and increase the risk of hypoglycemia.

The dried or fresh leaves are also used as an herb or vegetable ( 96068 ). Fenugreek constituents include flavonoids, alkaloids, coumarins, and saponins ( 96068 ). Fenugreek seeds have a distinctive bitter taste and odor due to the alkaloids of volatiles found in the seed ( 96068 ). The active constituents include trigonelline, 4-hydroxyisoleucine, and sotolon ( 12533 , 49582 ). Sotolon is frequently used as a flavoring for artificial maple syrup ( 12533 ). Soaking fenugreek seeds overnight and washing the seeds in water can decrease some of the taste and odor ( 9783 ). Other constituents of fenugreek include steroidal saponins, including diosgenin ( 49571 , 49683 ), yamogenin ( 96068 ), protodioscin ( 49573 ), and trigoneosides ( 49543 ). Fenugreek seeds are high in dietary fiber, including galactomannan ( 49655 , 49774 ). They contain about 50% dietary fiber and pectin. Fenugreek seed is also a good source of protein ( 49827 ). About 80% of the total content of free amino acids in the seeds is present as 4-hydroxyisoleucine ( 12533 , 49641 ). Fenugreek seed oil contains the following fatty acids: linoleic, oleic, linolenic, arachidic, palmitolic, eicosadienoic, palmitic, stearic, and myristic acids, with combined linoleic and oleic acids making up 67% to 76% of fatty acids ( 90119 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Fenugreek is used in traditional topical anti-inflammatory treatments. In various animal models, fenugreek seed extract had anti-inflammatory effects. However, a mechanism of action is not clear ( 49550 , 49720 ). Anticancer effects Fenugreek is traditionally used orally for cancer prevention. Epidemiological evidence suggests that a diet rich in fresh vegetables, including fenugreek leaves, protected against gallbladder cancer ( 49651 ). In animal research, fenugreek seeds inhibited colon carcinogenesis ( 49601 , 49686 ) and breast cancer ( 49631 ). This may be due to the apoptotic and growth inhibitory effects of fenugreek and its constituents on cancer cells, as shown in vitro ( 49573 , 49692 , 49724 ). Although the mechanisms of action are not clear, various laboratory studies have shown that fenugreek constituents interfere with cell signaling pathways in cancer cells ( 49731 , 49751 ), as well as increase antioxidant status ( 49686 ). Antidiabetic effects Many clinical studies show that taking fenugreek seed improves postprandial and fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance test results, and 24-hour urinary glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 90112 , 96065 ). In patients with type 1 diabetes, 50 grams of defatted fenugreek seed powder taken twice daily with meals for 10 days reduced 24-hour urine glucose levels by 54% ( 622 ). Fenugreek seeds contain about 50% dietary fiber and pectin and may affect gastrointestinal transit, slowing glucose absorption ( 49723 , 49791 ). About 80% of the total content of free amino acids in the seeds is present as 4-hydroxyisoleucine, which appears to directly stimulate insulin ( 8112 , 12532 , 12533 ). This effect is glucose-dependent and only occurs in the presence of moderate to high glucose concentrations. In other laboratory research, fenugreek seed extract appears to stimulate the effects of insulin in adipocyte, muscle, and liver cells ( 49635 , 49659 ). Other fenugreek constituents with potential hypoglycemic effects include trigonelline, as shown in animal research ( 49763 ). Antioxidant activity The antioxidant effects of fenugreek and its constituents may explain some of its clinical effects. Antioxidant effects of fenugreek have been shown in various animal models, resulting in improvements in both antioxidant and oxidant levels ( 49526 , 49565 , 49586 , 49640 , 49686 , 49754 , 49866 ). Antiplatelet activity Fenugreek contains coumarins and other constituents that might affect platelet aggregation, but these constituents may not be present in quantities that would produce clinically significant effects ( 7389 ). In animal research, a fenugreek leaf extract inhibited adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation ( 49643 ). Antiulcer effects Fenugreek is traditionally used for dyspepsia, GERD, and mouth ulcers. Animal research shows that fenugreek protects against aspirin- and ethanol-induced gastric injury, possibly by increasing the antioxidant activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and by decreasing thiol groups ( 49867 , 113501 ). It was also suggested that fenugreek gel has effects on mucosal glycoproteins and prevents a rise in lipid peroxidation induced by aspirin ( 49867 ). However, in laboratory research, fenugreek extract did not have bactericidal effects against Helicobacter pylori ( 36131 ). Ergogenic effects In young males, a specific fenugreek extract (Torabolic, Indus Biotech) increased leg and bench press performance ( 18353 ). Clinical research in untrained adults performing an incremental cycle to exhaustion test shows that taking either a specific fenugreek soluble fiber (FenuMAT; Akay Group, Ltd) 300 mg or a specific combination product containing turmeric and fenugreek (CurQfen; Akay Group Ltd) 500 mg daily for 28 days increases ventilatory threshold, but has no effect on peak oxygen consumption or respiratory exchange ratio, when compared with placebo ( 108702 ). Other human studies have examined the possible mechanism of action on exercise performance. Although the constituent amino acid, 4-hydroxyisoleucine, increased muscle glycogen concentration ( 49624 ), fenugreek extract was found to have no effect on muscle glycogen synthesis ( 49689 ). In animal research, fenugreek increased swimming endurance, perhaps by increasing the utilization of fatty acids as an energy source ( 49664 ). Hormonal effects In males with oligospermia, fenugreek seed oil, but not remaining fenugreek seed components, improves sperm count and quality ( 90119 ). These improvements have also been observed in males with primary hypogonadism using a specific fenugreek seed extract (Furosap; Chemical Resources) ( 108700 ). In males, fenugreek has been shown to increase testosterone levels. This is mainly due to an increase in free testosterone and not total testosterone ( 18352 , 93419 , 93423 , 103282 ). Other clinical research in males with symptomatic hypogonadism shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract fortified with protodioscin 20% (Furosap; Chemical Resources) 500 mg daily for 12 weeks increases free and total testosterone levels by 0.9 ng/dL and 110 ng/dL, respectively, and modestly decreases dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S) levels when compared with baseline ( 108700 ). This increase in testosterone levels is also seen in animal models of diabetes or testicular damage ( 93424 , 93426 ) but not in castrated animals where only total testosterone was measured ( 93425 ). However, in one study of healthy young males, fenugreek extract did not increase testosterone levels ( 93421 ). It is possible that fenugreek extract only improves testosterone levels in individuals with lower baseline levels. Fenugreek also appears to increase testosterone levels in females ( 93420 ). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, it has been suggested that fenugreek saponins might increase testosterone levels by partially inhibiting 5-alpha reductase and aromatase enzymes ( 93419 ) or upregulating enzymes involved in steroid synthesis in the testis ( 93426 ). The fenugreek saponins might also bind to estrogen receptors and induce estrogen-responsive genes ( 93420 , 93421 ). In females, fenugreek extract increases estradiol levels ( 93421 ), as well as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ( 93422 ). Fenugreek extract does not appear to alter levels of DHEA-S, androstenedione, estradiol, sex hormone-blinding globulin, or prolactin ( 93419 ). Animal models suggest the potential for anti-fertility, abortifacient, and teratogenic effects at oral doses of at least 100 mg/kg. In male animals, complete infertility, hormonal changes, and sperm toxicity, including decreased sperm count and motility and morphological abnormalities, have been seen. In female animals, high levels of fenugreek have resulted in changes in hormone levels, decreased implantation rates, and increased abortifacient effects. Fetal size was reduced and fetal mortality increased ( 96068 ). Teratogenic effects include neurological abnormalities ( 96068 ). The human equivalent of the lowest dose causing negative effects during pregnancy is 972 mg per 60 kg ( 96068 ). Hypolipidemic effects Preliminary clinical research shows that taking fenugreek seed reduces total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but has inconsistent effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides ( 622 , 7389 , 9783 , 18359 , 18361 , 18362 ). In vitro, the hypolipidemic effect of fenugreek seeds was thought to be mediated through inhibition of fat accumulation and upregulation of the LDL receptor ( 49746 ). The hypolipidemic effects of fenugreek may also be due to their constituent saponins. Saponins are altered to sapogenins in the gastrointestinal tract. Sapogenins increase biliary cholesterol secretion, potentially leading to lower serum cholesterol levels ( 49766 , 49839 ). Renoprotective effects Some evidence from animal research suggests that fenugreek seed consumption might decrease calcium oxalate deposition in the kidneys ( 720 , 49687 ). Stimulating effects Preliminary research suggests fenugreek has stimulating effects on the uterus, intestine, and heart ( 12531 ). Teratogenic effects Animal research shows that fenugreek has antifertility and teratogenic effects ( 96068 ). These effects might be related to the hormonal activities of the saponins in fenugreek. Also, the flavonoids in fenugreek could cross the placenta and cause pro-oxidant effects, damaging the DNA ( 96068 ). Neurotoxic effects of fenugreek have been shown in animal models suggesting that prenatal exposure to fenugreek could impact the neurological development and later performance ( 96068 ). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, the monoaminergic and cholinergic systems might be involved ( 96068 ). Fenugreek also seems to inhibit hematopoietic regulatory elements in bone marrow, altering the hematological count of the fetus ( 96068 ). Weight loss effects In short-term human research, a fenugreek seed extract has been shown to reduce daily fat intake but it does not appear to affect weight, appetite, or satiety ( 18348 , 18349 ). Fenugreek fiber intake at breakfast increases feelings of satiety ( 18350 ). Although effects on weight loss in humans is not clear, in animal models, fenugreek fiber and seed extract have been shown to reduce body weight and food intake ( 49634 , 49681 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Likely Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Fenugreek</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Diabetes. Oral fenugreek seed seems to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Meta-analyses of up to14 clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes or other metabolic conditions show that taking fenugreek with or without standard diabetes medications lowers fasting glucose by approximately 14-27 mg/dL, 2-hour postprandial glucose by 21-30 mg/dL, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.5-1.2% when compared with placebo ( 90112 , 96065 , 105016 , 111503 , 112120 , 113499 , 113604 , 113630 ). The most effective doses and formulations seem to include powdered seed or debitterized seed powder 100 grams daily, taken as capsules or added to meals, for up to 3 years or seed hydroalcoholic extract about 1 gram daily for up to 2 months ( 90112 , 96065 , 105016 , 111503 , 112120 , 113499 ). The validity of these effects is limited by high heterogeneity and low quality in the included studies. Most research also shows that fenugreek seed lowers total cholesterol levels and triglycerides in patients with diabetes, but has inconsistent effects on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ( 96065 , 102252 , 113630 ). Some research shows that taking fenugreek in combination with other ingredients also seems to improve glycemic indices in people with diabetes. These combination products have combined fenugreek with guar gum and gymnema ( 10284 ) or millets and legumes ( 9784 ). Limited research has also evaluated fenugreek in type 1 diabetes. In one small clinical study, taking 50 grams of defatted fenugreek seed powder twice daily with meals for 10 days reduced 24-hour urine glucose levels by 54% when compared to baseline ( 622 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Dysmenorrhea. Oral fenugreek seed might help to reduce menstrual pain. A meta-analysis of 2 clinical studies in patients with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea shows that taking fenugreek capsules 5.4-6.3 grams daily for 3 days beginning on the first day of the menstrual cycle for 2 consecutive months reduces pain intensity when compared with placebo ( 113628 ). However, low-quality clinical studies show that fenugreek seed is not more effective for reducing menstrual pain when compared with garden cress or the anti-inflammatory medication mefenamic acid ( 113628 ). more Sexual arousal. Oral fenugreek seed might help to improve sexual arousal. Clinical research shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (Testofen, Gencor Pacific Ltd) 600 mg daily for 12 weeks increases sexual function by 15% over baseline, compared with no change in the placebo group; the main benefits were in sexual arousal and drive. Morning erection and sexual frequency also improve by 2- to 3-fold ( 93419 ). Another clinical study in healthy males shows that taking the same fenugreek seed extract 600 mg daily in combination with magnesium 34 mg, zinc 30 mg, and vitamin B6 10 mg for 6 weeks, improves a composite of symptoms such as sexual cognition, sexual arousal, sexual behavior, and orgasm. The overall improvement in the composite score was 23%, compared with a worsening in the placebo group ( 93421 ). more Sexual dysfunction. Oral fenugreek seed extract might help to improve sexual dysfunction. Clinical research shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (Libifem, Gencor Pacific Ltd.) 300 mg twice daily for two menstrual cycles improves sexual function in healthy pre-menopausal adults with low sex drive. In one clinical trial, overall improvement based on a composite of symptoms was 26% in the fenugreek group, compared with only 2% in the placebo group. Individual scores for sexual cognition, arousal, behavior, drive, and orgasm were all improved. Patients taking fenugreek also had an increased frequency of sexual activity from 1-2 times per month to once per week, compared to no change in the placebo group ( 93420 ). Other clinical research in males aged 35-60 years with symptomatic hypogonadism shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (Furosap; Chemical Resources) 500 mg daily after breakfast for 12 weeks improves sexual arousal, mental alertness, and mood when compared with baseline. This fenugreek seed extract was fortified with 20% protodioscin; the other constituents were not specified ( 108700 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of comparator group. more Possibly Ineffective Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oral fenugreek extract does not seem to improve BPH symptoms. A clinical study in healthy adults with BPH shows that taking a specific fenugreek extract (Testofen, Bluegum Pharmaceuticals) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve BPH symptoms when compared with placebo ( 102253 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Alopecia areata. Although there is interest in using oral fenugreek for alopecia areata, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition. Alzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed extract is beneficial for Alzheimer disease. A moderate-sized study in adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking fenugreek seed extract 5 mL daily for 4 months modestly improves memory but does not improve depression or quality of life measures when compared with placebo ( 113498 ). more Athletic performance. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for improving athletic performance. Research evaluating fenugreek for athletic performance has yielded inconsistent results. The reason for these mixed findings is unclear. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in healthy adult males shows that taking fenugreek or fenugreek seed extract 250-600 mg daily for 8-12 weeks does not improve upper or lower body strength, lean body mass, or fat mass when compared with placebo ( 113629 ). Other small clinical studies in resistance-trained young males show that taking a fenugreek supplement (AI or Torabolic, Indus Biotech; Fenu-FG, Indus Biotech Private Limited) for 8 weeks in addition to training does not improve power or strength when compared with placebo, but modestly improves some measures, such as leg and bench press performance, and slightly reduces body fat ( 18352 , 18353 , 93423 ). While most clinical research is in males, a clinical study in healthy adult females shows that taking fenugreek (Libifem, Gencor Pacific Ltd.) 600 mg daily for 8 weeks in conjunction with resistance training improves lower body strength, lean body mass, and fat mass when compared with placebo. However, there was no change in upper body strength, endurance, or power when compared with placebo ( 113631 ). more Atopic dermatitis (eczema). Although there is interest in using topical fenugreek for eczema, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition. Cough. Although there is interest in using oral fenugreek for cough, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this purpose. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It is unclear if oral fenugreek fiber is beneficial for improving heartburn symptoms. A small clinical study in patients with frequent heartburn shows that taking a specific fenugreek fiber product (FenuLife, Frutarom Belgium), 2 grams twice daily 30 minutes before the two biggest meals of the day, improves heartburn after one week of treatment and continuing through the 2-week study period. Fenugreek seemed to be similarly effective to ranitidine 75 mg twice daily ( 17372 ). more Gout. Although there is interest in using topical fenugreek for gout, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition. Hyperlipidemia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral fenugreek supplements might be beneficial for improving lipid levels. Overall, fenugreek powdered seed seems to modestly reduce lipid levels in people with or without hyperlipidemia; however, most studies have been low-quality, small, and exploratory. Meta-analyses of these studies show that fenugreek reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ( 103283 , 103284 ). Powdered fenugreek seed has been studied in doses of 0.5-100 grams daily for 10 days to 3 years. While some studies show modest improvement, others show no benefit ( 622 , 7389 , 9783 , 18359 , 18361 , 18362 , 102252 , 103283 , 103284 , 113497 ). more Hypertension. Analysis of small clinical studies suggests that oral fenugreek might slightly improve systolic blood pressure (SBP). A meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies in healthy adults or those with diabetes, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome shows that taking fenugreek seed 0.5-50 grams daily for 6-144 weeks reduces SBP by 3.5 mmHg but does not improve diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when compared with placebo. However, subgroup analysis suggests that taking fenugreek at a dose of 15 grams or more daily or for a duration of 12 weeks or less modestly reduces DBP ( 112110 ). more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral fenugreek is beneficial in patients with prediabetes. A small clinical study in adults with prediabetes shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (Trigogen, Gencor Pacific Ltd.) 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose and postprandial blood glucose but not glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting insulin, or postprandial insulin when compared with placebo ( 113497 ). Another small clinical trial in patients with prediabetes shows that taking fenugreek seed extract 200 mg, bergamot extract 500 mg, and olive leaf extract 100 mg daily for 6 months does not improve glycated hemoglobin or fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo ( 102251 ). more Joint pain. Although there is interest in using oral fenugreek for joint pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition. Lactation. Small clinical studies suggest that oral fenugreek, either as a supplement or tea, might increase lactation. A network meta-analysis of 4 small clinical trials shows that taking fenugreek shortly after delivery may modestly increase breast milk production when compared with placebo. Patients in the included studies took fenugreek 1-2 grams as capsules or tea up to 3 times daily for 21-244 days. In most cases, fenugreek treatment was initiated one or two days after delivery. However, fenugreek might be less beneficial for breast milk production when compared with the natural ingredients Indian borage or palm date ( 96067 ). Fenugreek has also been used in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study suggests that drinking a specific herbal tea containing fenugreek. hibiscus, fennel, rooibos, vervain, raspberry, goat's rue, and fennel oil (Humana Still-Tee, Humana, Germany) 200 mL three times daily modestly increases milk production when compared with placebo ( 22569 ). Another study in exclusively breastfeeding parents of 2-month-old infants shows that eating lactation cookies containing fenugreek, oatmeal, brewer's yeast, and flaxseed meal daily for 30 days do not improve milk production, perceived insufficiency, or breastfeeding self-efficacy when compared with control ( 112116 ). more Male infertility. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for improving sperm quality in males with infertility. A small clinical study in healthy male patients ages 20-30 years with oligospermia shows that taking fenugreek seed oil 12 macro drops orally three times daily for 4 months improves sperm count from 6.2 million to 20.1 million, increases sperm motility from 43% to 61%, and reduces sperm abnormality from 68% to 53% when compared with baseline. However, taking the remaining fenugreek seed components 10 grams three times daily for 4 months does not seem to have this effect ( 90119 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Menopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for improving menopausal symptoms. A small clinical study in perimenopausal patients shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (FenuSMART) 250 mg, standardized to protodioscin 10.3%, trigonelline 3.1%, and total saponin 42.6%, twice daily with meals for 42 days does not improve menopausal symptoms when compared with placebo. However, there was a non-significant trend to reduced hot flashes, night sweats, depression, and insomnia in the treatment group ( 105000 ). This study was funded by the supplement manufacturer. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for metabolic syndrome. A meta-analysis of 29 small clinical studies in healthy adults or those with type 2 diabetes or other metabolic conditions shows that taking fenugreek at doses ranging from 25 mg to 60 grams daily for up to 144 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by 17 mg/dL, triglycerides by 20 mg/dL, waist circumference by 2.5 cm, and systolic blood pressure by 3.5 mmHg and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 3.5 mg/dL when compared with control. However, no effect was found on diastolic blood pressure or body mass index ( 113500 ). more Muscle strength. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for increasing muscle strength. A small study in healthy, active males shows that taking fenugreek seed extract 400 mg or 500 mg daily for 60 days increases grip strength when compared with placebo ( 103285 ). more Myalgia. Although there is interest in using topical fenugreek for myalgia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition. Obesity. Small clinical studies suggest that oral fenugreek seed or fiber may increase satiety and decrease caloric intake. Two small clinical studies in overweight and normal weight males shows that taking fenugreek seed extract modestly reduces daily fat intake. At a dose of 392 mg three times daily for 2-6 weeks, fat intake is reduced by 13% to 17%. However, a lower dose of 196 mg three times daily appears to be ineffective. Neither of the doses affect weight, appetite, or satiety ( 18348 , 18349 ). Another small clinical study in obese adults shows that adding 8 grams of fenugreek fiber powder (FenuLife, Frutarom Inc) to a low-calorie beverage increases feelings of satiety and decreases hunger and lunchtime food intake. A lower dose of 4 grams appears to be less effective for reducing hunger but was considered to be more palatable ( 18350 ). more Parkinson disease. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for Parkinson disease symptoms. One small clinical study in patients with Parkinson disease who are also using levodopa shows that taking fenugreek seed extract (Indus Biotech Private Limited, Pune) 300 mg twice daily for 6 months does not seem to improve behavioral or motor symptoms when compared with placebo ( 90113 ). more Peptic ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral fenugreek for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for PCOS. A small clinical study in adults with symptomatic PCOS shows that adding a specific fenugreek seed extract (Goldarou Pharmaceutical Co.) 500 mg twice daily to metformin for 8 weeks does not improve insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity, or other symptoms when compared with placebo and metformin ( 90117 ). However, other small clinical studies in adults with PCOS show that taking another specific fenugreek seed extract (Furocyst, Cepham Inc.) 1000 mg, enriched with 40% furostanolic saponins, daily for 90 days is associated with a reduction in ovarian cyst size in 46% of patients, complete dissolution in 36% of patients, normalization of menstrual cycles in 71% to 80% of patients, and subsequent pregnancy in 12% of patients. Further, this extract appears to reduce mean cyst size by 42% to 45%, the number of cysts by 38%, ovary volume by 24% to 40%, and hirsutism by 27% while reducing luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, free testosterone, and prolactin and improving liver function and the severity of PCOS-associated ailments including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia ( 93422 , 112112 , 113502 ). The validity of some of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Furthermore, this study was funded by the supplement manufacturer. more Vaginitis. There is limited evidence on the topical use of fenugreek cream in patients with atrophic vaginitis. One small clinical study in postmenopausal patients with atrophic vaginitis shows that administration of 0.5 grams of fenugreek 5% cream intravaginally twice weekly for 12 weeks reduces symptoms of atrophic vaginitis and reduces vaginal pH when compared to baseline. However, fenugreek was not as effective as vaginal cream containing conjugated estrogens ( 103286 ). Another small clinical study in postmenopausal patients with vaginal atrophy shows that applying a fenugreek cream 5% intravaginally daily for 8 weeks seems to reduce dyspareunia and vaginal dryness and increase vaginal maturation when compared with a placebo cream ( 105023 ). more Wound healing. Although there is interest in using topical fenugreek for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this purpose. More evidence is needed to rate fenugreek for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Fenugreek has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the US ( 4912 ). Possibly Safe when the seed is used orally in medicinal amounts. Fenugreek seed powder 5-10 grams daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 3 years. Fenugreek seed extract 1 gram daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 3 months ( 7389 , 9783 , 18359 , 18362 , 49868 , 90112 , 90113 , 90117 , 93419 , 93420 )( 93421 , 93422 , 93423 , 96065 , 103285 , 108704 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods ( 4912 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of fenugreek when used in larger amounts. Unusual body and urine odor has been reported after consumption of fenugreek tea. Although the odor appears to be harmless, it may be misdiagnosed as maple syrup urine disease ( 9782 , 96068 ). PREGNANCY: Likely Unsafe when used orally in amounts greater than those found in food. Fenugreek has potential oxytoxic and uterine stimulant activity ( 12531 ). There are case reports of congenital malformations, including hydrocephalus, anencephaly, cleft palate, and spina bifida, after consumption of fenugreek seeds during pregnancy ( 96068 ). Consumption of fenugreek immediately prior to delivery may cause the neonate to have unusual body odor. Although this does not appear to cause long-term sequelae, it may be misdiagnosed as maple syrup urine disease ( 9781 , 96068 ). LACTATION: Possibly Safe when used orally to stimulate lactation, short-term. Although most available clinical studies lack safety testing in the lactating parent or infant ( 12535 , 22569 , 22570 ), some evidence suggests that taking fenugreek 1725 mg three times daily orally for 21 days does not cause negative side effects in the infant ( 90115 ).</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: Fenugreek seed powder has most often been used in doses of 5-10 grams daily for up to 3 years; daily doses as high as 100 grams have been used for up to 20 days. Fenugreek seed extract is most often used in doses of about 0.6-1.2 grams daily for up to 3 months ( 90112 , 93420 , 93422 , 96065 ). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Topical: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Standardization &amp; Formulation One capsule of a specific fenugreek product (FenuLife, Frutarom Belgium) has been standardized to contain 500 mg of fractioned tempered fenugreek seeds (85% total fiber) and galactomannan with a 1:1 mannose to galactose ratio ( 17372 ). One capsule of a different fenugreek product (Libifem, Gencor Pacific Ltd.) contains 300 mg of an extract equivalent to 9.9 grams of dry fenugreek product and is standardized to 50% saponin glycosides ( 93420 ). Another fenugreek product is an extract standardized to 40% furostanolic saponins (Furocyst, Cepham Inc.). Each capsule contains 500 mg fenugreek extract. Batch #FCYS0813 was used in the study ( 93422 ). Fenu-FG capsules contain 300 mg of fenugreek furostanol glycosides (Indus Biotech Private Ltd., Pune, India), characterized by HPLC fingerprinting ( 93423 ).

Severity HIGH Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, fenugreek might have additive effects when used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. Some of the constituents in fenugreek have antiplatelet effects in animal and in vitro research. However, common fenugreek products might not contain sufficient concentrations of these constituents for clinical effects. A clinical study in patients with coronary artery disease or diabetes shows that taking fenugreek seed powder 2.5 grams twice daily for 3 months does not affect platelet aggregation, fibrinolytic activity, or fibrinogen levels ( 5191 , 7389 , 49643 ). more ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, fenugreek seed might have additive hypoglycemic effects when used with antidiabetes drugs. Clinical research shows that fenugreek seed can reduce fasting blood glucose and 2-hour postprandial glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes ( 10284 , 90112 , 96065 , 105016 ). more CLOPIDOGREL (Plavix) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, fenugreek seed might alter the clinical effects of clopidogrel by inhibiting its conversion to the active form. Animal research shows that fenugreek seed 200 mg/kg daily for 14 days increases the maximum serum concentration of clopidogrel by 21%. It is unclear how this affects the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of clopidogrel; however, this study found that concomitant use of fenugreek seed and clopidogrel prolonged bleeding time by an additional 11% ( 108701 ). more METOPROLOL (Toprol) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, fenugreek seed might have additive hypotensive effects when used with metoprolol. Animal research shows that fenugreek seed 300 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks decreases systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 9% and 11%, respectively, when administered alone, and by 15% and 22%, respectively, when given with metoprolol 10 mg/kg ( 108703 ). more PHENYTOIN (Dilantin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, fenugreek might decrease plasma levels of phenytoin. Animal research shows that taking fenugreek seeds for 1 week decreases maximum concentrations and the area under the curve of a single dose of phenytoin by 44% and 72%, respectively. This seems to be related to increased clearance ( 110905 ). So far, this interaction has not been reported in humans. more SILDENAFIL (Viagra) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, concurrent use of sildenafil and fenugreek might reduce levels and therapeutic effects of sildenafil. Animal research shows that taking fenugreek seeds for 1 week reduces maximum concentrations and the area under the curve of a single dose of sildenafil by 27% and 48%, respectively ( 110898 ). So far, this interaction has not been reported in humans. more THEOPHYLLINE Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, fenugreek may reduce the levels and clinical effects of theophylline. Animal research shows that fenugreek 50 grams daily for 7 days reduces the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of theophylline by 28% and the area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC) by 22% ( 90118 ). more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, fenugreek might have additive effects with warfarin and increase the international normalized ratio (INR). Some fenugreek constituents have antiplatelet effects, although these might not be present in concentrations that are clinically significant ( 7389 ). In one case report, a patient taking warfarin experienced an increased INR when starting to take fenugreek in combination with boldo ( 5191 ). more</data><data key="name">Fenugreek</data><data key="scientific_name">Trigonella foenugraecum, Trigonella foenum-graecum</data><data key="overview_text">Fenugreek is an aromatic, clover-like herb that is native to the Mediterranean region, southern Europe, and western Asia. The plant has seed-containing pods that form as it matures. The taste and odor of fenugreek seeds resemble maple syrup, leading to its use as a flavoring agent in imitation maple syrup, foods, beverages, and tobacco and to mask the taste of medicines. The seeds have also been used as a spice and traditional medicine. Fenugreek leaves are eaten in India as a vegetable.</data></node>

Shellfish, such as oyster, shrimp, and scallop, also contain omega-3 fatty acids, but in lesser amounts. These types of fish contain oil with long-chain polyunsaturated acids of the omega-3 family. Omega-3 fatty acids refer to the hydrocarbon chains with a methyl group at one end (called the omega position) and a carboxyl group at the other. Omega-3 fatty acids have a double bond at the third carbon (n-3). Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are two omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil. EPA is sometimes written C20:5 omega-3 (20 carbons, 5 double bonds with the first at the n-3 position). DHA is C22:6 omega-3 (22 carbons, 6 double bonds with the first at the n-3 position) ( 12914 ). Fish oil supplements contain varying amounts of EPA and DHA (18-51% and 12-32%, respectively). The body cannot produce the parent omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid, nor can it convert omega-6 fatty acids, which are plentiful in the Western diet, into omega-3 fatty acids. EPA and DHA seem to have different physiologic effects than their precursor alpha-linolenic acid, a plant-derived omega-3 fatty acid ( 10323 , 12918 , 13763 ). Alpha-linolenic acid, even with long-term consumption, doesn't have the same effect as fish oil on triglyceride concentrations, on tissue DHA concentrations, or on in vitro susceptibility to oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ( 12918 ). However, the effects of fish oil and alpha-linolenic acid seem to be similar with respect to hemostatic factors such as thromboxane production, bleeding time, and other factors ( 13768 ). Fish oil can change the way other dietary fatty acids are utilized. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil compete metabolically with omega-6 fatty acids and other omega-3 fatty acids in vegetable oils. Alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid are the primary omega-3 and omega-6 (respectively) fatty acids found in vegetable oils. Fish oil can modify the way these dietary fatty acids are incorporated into fatty acid chains and cell membranes and how they are used in other metabolic processes ( 7381 , 8693 , 9772 ). By increasing the intake of omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, there is a simultaneous reduction of omega-6 fatty acids corresponding to an increase of omega-3 fatty acids in cell membranes and circulatory lipids ( 8677 , 113222 ). Although there is some concern that dietary vegetable oils in the diet might negate the beneficial cardiovascular effects of fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil seem to reduce cardiovascular risk factors despite concurrent omega-6 fatty acid ingestion ( 7381 , 8693 ). The efficacy of omega-3 fatty acid containing products such as fish oil seems to be determined by an increased intake of omega-3 fatty-acids, a decreased intake of omega-6 fatty acids, and a decreased ratio of arachidonic acid to EPA and DHA ( 8671 , 8694 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Fish oil has anti-inflammatory effects and is of interest for a variety of inflammatory conditions, including psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and others. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, due to decreased levels of these fatty acids in the plasma and synovial fluid of these patients ( 5710 , 13759 , 110337 ). The anti-inflammatory effects of fish oil might explain the relationship shown in epidemiological research between fish consumption and lower risk of dry eye syndrome ( 13770 ). Various mechanisms of action might explain the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids compete with arachidonic acid in the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways and inhibit leukotriene synthesis ( 13759 ). Fish oils and omega-3 fatty acids appear to suppress mediators of immune function by reducing the production of cytokines and suppressing the synthesis and levels of interleukin-1 (alpha and beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) ( 12471 , 17523 , 65716 , 65721 , 66007 , 66016 , 66229 , 66377 , 66510 , 66511 )( 66512 , 105225 , 107190 , 107194 , 116624 ). Some clinical research suggests omega-3 fatty acids decrease endothelial activation by reducing intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and thrombomodulin levels, indicating a reduction in inflammation ( 13754 ). In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, fish oil has been shown to reduce the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ( 107188 ). In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, taking fish oil increased levels of the anti-inflammatory D- and E-series resolvin and protectin precursors, 14- and 17-HDHA, and 15- and 18-HEPE ( 110337 ). Due to conflicting findings, it is unclear if taking fish oil reduces plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) or other inflammatory mediators in human research. In one clinical trial, taking omega-3 fatty acids along with simvastatin appears to reduce hs-CRP in coronary heart disease (CHD) and CHD risk equivalent patients with dyslipidemias when compared to simvastatin alone ( 65606 ). In people at high cardiovascular risk, consuming high levels of omega-3 fatty acids from oily fish modestly reduces levels of hs-CRP ( 106074 ). Fish oil has also been shown to reduce CRP levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, patients with lung cancer, and patients undergoing hemodialysis ( 107188 , 107190 , 107194 , 115740 ). However, in one study, although taking atorvastatin along with fish oil appears to reduce plasma levels of hs-CRP and IL-6 in dyslipidemic obese patients, taking fish oil alone has no effect ( 65537 ). Also, fish oil doesn't appear to affect CRP levels in otherwise healthy people, or patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ( 10155 , 12925 , 13735 , 107189 , 107197 , 10815 ). It also does not appear to affect IL-6 levels in patients with lung cancer ( 107194 ). In patients with schizophrenia and metabolic syndrome on long-term olanzapine, the decrease of triglyceride levels occurring after fish oil supplementation seems to be related to a decrease in TNF-alpha ( 105225 ). Anti-stress effects In human research, fish oil blunted adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels in healthy humans submitted to intravenous lipopolysaccharide ( 65741 ). In hemodialysis patients, fish oil reduced adrenal over-reactivity (reduced epinephrine) induced by oral glucose; glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity were not affected ( 65812 ). In human research, omega-3 fatty acids decreased plasma norepinephrine ( 65639 ). Antiallergic effects Perinatal omega-3 fatty acid supplementation seems to reduce the prevalence of positive egg skin prick tests in the infant and the prevalence of childhood asthma, possibly by reducing cord blood interleukin-13 levels ( 66112 ). Antiarrhythmic properties Fish oil may be beneficial for arrhythmias because EPA may block fast voltage-dependent sodium channels via specific binding, which results in prolongation of the inactivated states of these channels ( 66409 , 66419 ). In dogs, the frequency of ectopic beats after myocardial infarction was reduced from 80% to less than 30% with omega-3 fatty acid ingestion ( 66304 ). There is evidence that omega-3 fatty acids may decrease the risk of cardiac arrhythmias in humans ( 7360 , 66397 , 66503 ); however, other studies reported conflicting results ( 14382 , 16732 , 65923 , 89343 , 114186 ). Antiasthmatic effects Omega-3 fatty acids seem to reduce the synthesis of leukotrienes by competing with and inhibiting the synthesis of arachidonic acid, suggesting usefulness for conditions such as asthma ( 13759 ). Sputum concentrations of leukotriene C4 and E4, prostaglandin D2, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were reduced in a clinical trial of patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction who were ingesting fish oil ( 65680 ). However, other research has not confirmed these results ( 66464 ). Antihypertensive effects DHA may have greater effects in reducing blood pressure than EPA ( 47975 ). Linoleic acid and fish oil fatty acids (administered by subcutaneous injection) were equally potent in reducing the rise in systolic arterial pressure induced by the chronic infusion of angiotensin II in rats ( 66209 ). Antineoplastic effects Some researchers think fish oil might also help prevent some forms of cancer. People with high EPA and DHA levels in their erythrocytes seem to have decreased rates of prostate cancer ( 6395 ). Animal and in vitro research suggests supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids slows the growth or inhibit the development of lung, colon, breast, pancreatic, intestinal/gastric, colorectal, and prostate cancers as well as lymphoma ( 6398 , 13764 , 65519 , 65831 , 65863 , 65892 , 66160 , 66199 , 66235 , 66276 )( 66277 , 66368 , 66369 , 66403 , 91249 ). In humans, research suggests that modifying the omega-6/omega-3 ratio through dietary intervention plus fish oil supplements reduces the tumor progression marker Ki-67, in patients with prostate cancer ( 116625 ). EPA and DHA might compete with arachidonic acid as substrates for cyclooxygenases that produce prostaglandins that can enhance tumor growth ( 6385 , 7378 ). There is evidence fish oil supplementation decreases the expression of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which has been found in prostate cancer tissue and is thought to play a role in promoting the growth of cancer cells ( 8689 ). There is also preliminary evidence that high levels of EPA and DHA can be beneficial for prolonging cancer remission. Fish oil might decrease production of lactic acid by tumor cells. Lactic acidosis is a marker of unfavorable metabolic conditions associated with many cancers ( 6398 ). There is also some evidence that fish oil might be cytotoxic to some cancer cells ( 1008 ). Preliminary evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids are first oxidized and then accumulate in tumor cell membranes, resulting in cell membrane perforation and eventually tumor cell death ( 8691 ). In vitro evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acids can inhibit ecto-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase disulfide-thiol exchanger 2 (ENOX2) in human epithelial cells. ENOX2 is a protein on the cell surface of cancer cells that is involved in unregulated growth ( 66513 ). In vitro, omega-3 fatty acids upregulate components of the transforming growth factor beta-1 pathway in ovarian cancer cell lines. Activation of this pathway can negatively regulate cell growth and reduce the risk of malignant transformation ( 65942 ). Antinociceptive effects Clinical research shows that increasing dietary intakes of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA reduces the duration and frequency of migraine headaches. Taking these fatty acids increases levels of the DHA oxylipin metabolites, including 17-hydroxydocosahexaeonic acid (17- HDHA). This compound has antinociceptive effects in animal models and is associated with reduced pain in patients with osteoarthritis ( 105289 ). Antioxidant effects In humans exposed to particulate matter, supplementation with fish oil increased Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione levels ( 65902 ). In patients with Alzheimer disease, taking fish oil increased activity of catalase and decreased oxidation of proteins and lipids. However, there was no effect on superoxide dismutase activity ( 110334 ). In vitro, DHA decreased oxidative stress in human fibroblasts ( 65683 ). GSH content was increased and was associated with elevated catalytic activities of gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl ligase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase. Antiplatelet effects Some research suggests that EPA and DHA might block the inflammatory, vasoconstrictive, and thrombogenic effects of omega-6 fatty acids ( 10007 , 12914 ). Omega-3 fatty acids compete with arachidonic acid in the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Omega-3s are metabolized to products that inhibit platelet aggregation. Therefore fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids decrease synthesis of thromboxane A2 (and its precursor thromboxane B2) from arachidonic acid and increase the formation of thromboxane A3 ( 65847 , 66087 , 66128 , 66243 , 66294 , 66321 , 66364 , 66383 , 66391 ). Thromboxane A2 causes platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, while thromboxane A3 does not ( 66216 ). By decreasing synthesis of thromboxane A2, omega-3 fatty acids decrease platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction ( 66128 ). Preliminary clinical evidence suggest fish oil supplements might prolong pregnancy and depress levels of thromboxane A2 which is thought to cause vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, and reduced uteroplacental blood flow associated with pre-eclampsia ( 8707 ). Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that fish oil might have an additive or synergistic effect with aspirin on inhibiting synthesis of thromboxane A2 and the highly inflammatory leukotriene B4 ( 8701 ), but it's too early to recommend this combination. Fish oil can also cause increased production of prostacyclin and prostaglandin I3, prostaglandins that causes vasodilation and reduces platelet aggregation ( 8671 , 8679 , 8696 , 66099 , 66243 , 66295 ). Fish oil decreases platelet adhesion in ADP-stimulated platelets ( 14821 ). However, fish oil 10 grams/day appears to have less effect on platelet function than 100 mg of aspirin given intravenously ( 13769 ). Fish oil or omega-3 fatty acids may also increase fibrinolysis and vascular plasminogen activator levels, as well as altered levels of inhibitors of vascular plasminogen activator ( 66242 , 65825 , 66192 , 66197 , 65573 , 65914 ) and prothrombin fragment 1-2 ( 65460 ). Bone effects In adult hyperlipidemic patients, dietary supplementation with a milk drink fortified with fish oil, olive oil, vitamins A, B6, and E, and folic acid improved nutritional status and bone formation markers ( 66063 ). Furthermore, clinical research shows that EPA plus DHA supplementation increases levels of osteocalcin and procollagen, as well as serum and urinary levels of calcium in females with osteoporosis, which suggest an improvement in calcium absorption and osteoblastic activity ( 66507 ). However, omega-3 fatty acids in combination with other agents have mixed effects on bone mineral density (BMD) in human research ( 21001 , 66506 , 65530 , 65599 ). Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acids alone do NOT seem to affect BMD. One study shows that taking fish oil containing 0.45 or 4.5 grams EPA plus DHA daily for 2 years does not improve bone mineral density in patients with knee osteoarthritis ( 96122 ). Cardioprotective effects Fish oil is used for cardiovascular conditions, including stroke and heart disease, due to anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects. Fish oil decreases blood viscosity, increases red blood cell deformability, and possibly provides protection against red cell hemolysis. Vasodilatory effects of omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil may also prevent increases in blood pressure and maintain renal function. For example, fish oil can cause increased production of prostacyclin, a prostaglandin that causes vasodilation ( 8671 , 8679 , 8696 ). Fish oil may have an antiarrhythmic effect. There is some evidence prostaglandins derived from arachidonic acid are pro-arrhythmic, whereas equivalent prostaglandins derived from EPA are not. Preclinical research suggests fish oil might have a membrane stabilizing effect ( 12987 ). Fish oil might regulate calcium movement through calcium channels in the heart and suppress intracellular calcium activity, which has been associated with arrhythmias. Increased dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids increases the amount of EPA and DHA in cell membranes, which is thought to cause changes in enzyme and receptor function that secondarily leads to changes in calcium fluxes across cell membranes ( 8676 ). There's also some evidence fish oil might affect sodium and potassium channels and inhibit ischemia-induced arrhythmias ( 7362 , 7363 , 8671 , 8676 , 8677 , 8687 , 13767 ). Preliminary clinical research suggests that omega-3 fatty acids have antiarrhythmic effects, but do not induce arrhythmia in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia ( 13752 ). Regular consumption of fish seems to decrease heart rate, which might protect against cardiovascular events. Omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil, especially DHA, are associated with decreased heart rate ( 65746 ). Fish oil might also protect the heart by reducing inflammation and thrombosis, and inhibiting atherosclerosis ( 10154 , 11344 , 12919 , 12920 , 13751 , 98250 ). However, animal research suggests that long-term use of fish oil with or without aspirin does not prevent atherosclerosis in venous bypass grafts ( 13749 ). Additionally, some observational research has found that dietary or supplemental intake of fish oil is not associated with reduced plaque formation or plaque size ( 98251 ). Fish oil might also improve arterial flow. In some patients, fish oil appears to improve arterial compliance ( 1029 , 5707 ). Preliminary research suggests fish oil can reduce aortic wall thickness in hypertensive animals ( 14040 ). Research in adults with familial hypertension shows that taking fish oil 4 grams orally daily for 8 weeks improves post-prandial arterial elasticity following a fat load when compared with no intervention ( 111458 ). In other human research, marine omega-3 fatty acids improved large artery endothelium-dependent dilation in subjects with hypercholesterolemia without affecting endothelium-independent dilation ( 5702 ). However, in healthy adults, fish oil supplementation does not improve flow-mediated dilation or reduce the effects of prolonged sitting on leg endothelial function ( 102402 ). Fish oil also seems to reduce the death of cardiomyocytes, which increases in left ventricular hypertrophy ( 14039 ). In humans, red blood cell levels of omega-3 fatty acids were inversely associated with ventricular fibrillation during the acute ischemic phase of a myocardial infarction ( 65877 ). Overall, a 1% increase in the omega-3 index was associated with a 48% reduction in risk of ventricular fibrillation, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.52 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28-0.96; p=0.037). In hypertriglyceridemic men, DHA decreased fasting plasma remnant-like particle-cholesterol (RLP-C) and improved the red blood cell omega-3 index, novel risk factors for cardiovascular disease ( 65826 ). In hypertriglyceridemic men, DHA decreased levels of triglyceride as well as small, dense LDL particles ( 48174 ). In humans with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa and IIb, ex vivo and in vivo, platelet activation parameters exhibited signs of decreased activation by a six-week diet supplemented with omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which might be beneficial in reducing atherothrombotic risk ( 66515 ). In healthy volunteers, DHA improved lymphocyte activation (increased IL-2 mRNA following stimulation) and increased monocyte resistance to oxidized LDL-induced apoptosis ( 48226 ). Supplementary DHA and arachidonic acid (omega-6) resulted in increased coronary flow velocity reserve in Japanese elderly individuals ( 65781 ). Immune effects Fish oil can suppress mediators of immune function by reducing the production of cytokines such as interleukin-1(IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Some researchers think fish oil might prevent weight loss in cancer patients by inhibiting cytokines, which cause muscle catabolism. Fish oil also suppresses T- and B-cell proliferation and decrease delayed-type hypersensitivity skin response (DTH). They also decrease antibody production and increase free radical activity. In patients with IgA nephropathy, omega-3 fatty acids seem to reduce renal inflammation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines ( 1313 , 7383 , 7384 , 11979 , 13756 , 65775 , 65968 ). However, other human studies have found a lack of effect of omega-3 fatty acids on inflammatory cytokines ( 66490 , 65957 , 65985 , 65702 ). In human research, omega-3 fatty acids increased synthesis of leukotriene B5 and suppression of leukotriene B4 synthesis by ionophore-stimulated neutrophils ( 1040 , 65568 ). In healthy volunteers, DHA improved lymphocyte activation (increased IL-2 mRNA following stimulation) and increased monocyte resistance to oxidized LDL-induced apoptosis ( 48226 ). In male volunteers, DHA-rich fish oil stimulated an increase in phagocytic activity of neutrophils and monocytes, and increased neutrophil chemotactic response ( 48129 ). In older men, EPA caused a dose-dependent decrease in neutrophil respiratory burst and a reduction in prostaglandin E2 in younger and older men ( 65687 ). In human research, fish oil supplementation reduced CD44 expression and increased CD44v3 expression in cultured monocytes of peripheral arterial disease patients ( 65903 ). In healthy men, fish oil had immunostimulating effects, resulting in an increased zymosan-induced oxidative burst ( 65829 ). There is also interest in using fish oil in pregnant females with obesity to improve immune mediators in colostrum breast milk. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil 2.4 grams (containing DHA 1.9 grams and EPA 0.22 grams) orally once daily, beginning early in pregnancy, reduces colostrum levels of certain proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-alpha and interleukin-12, when compared with placebo ( 111454 ). A fish oil-enriched diet increased survival of mice following Klebsiella pneumonia infection compared to a control diet (olive oil- or corn oil-enriched diet) ( 66462 ). Fish oil as the exclusive source of lipid suppressed autoimmune lupus in MKL-lpR mice by decreasing lymphoid hyperplasia and macrophage surface I a expression, as well as delaying the onset of renal disease ( 66280 ). In another mouse model of lupus, suppression of autoimmune disease by DHA and EPA was felt to be related to a decrease in interleukin-1-beta gene transcription ( 66275 , 66315 , 66384 ). In animal studies after transplant, intravenous alimentation with fish oil-derived lipid emulsions prolonged heart transplant survival compared to omega-6 lipids ( 66395 ). Infant development effects Epidemiological research directly associates consumption of fish and fish oil in pregnancy with higher birth weight and length, and larger head circumference. However, very high consumption of fish and fish oil is also associated with smaller birth size and head circumference ( 13746 ). There is interest in using fish oil supplements to increase maternal supply of omega-3 fatty acids to the fetus. Taking fish oil 4 grams daily from 20 weeks gestation until delivery significantly increases EPA and DHA levels in the mother at 30 and 37 weeks gestation and for 6-weeks post-partum. EPA and DHA levels were also significantly higher in the erythrocytes of the newborn infants ( 15015 ). Animal studies suggest that perinatal omega-3 maternal supplementation may result in a lower fat mass of the offspring ( 66108 ). Lipid effects Fish oil may decrease cholesterol absorption from the gut and decrease cholesterol synthesis ( 5707 ). There is evidence fish and fish oil increase high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and decrease the total cholesterol to HDL ratio ( 2318 , 5707 , 8674 , 8678 , 8698 , 113210 ). Fish oil may increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations ( 2299 , 2318 , 8678 , 8698 ) by increasing the size of LDL particles ( 9771 ). It is thought that fish oil might cause a more buoyant LDL to be formed, which might be less atherogenic ( 2299 , 8678 ). In hypertriglyceridemia, fish oil is thought to lower triglycerides by decreasing secretion of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), increasing VLDL apolipoprotein B secretion, possibly by increasing VLDL clearance, and reducing triglyceride transport ( 5707 ). In addition, fish oil appears to decrease synthesis of VLDL by inhibiting 1,2-diacylglycerol-sterol o-acyltransferase or phosphatidate phosphatase ( 6394 ). Fish oil may decrease chylomicron concentrations. More lipoprotein lipase becomes available due to decreased VLDL levels, which causes increased hydrolysis of chylomicrons ( 6394 ). Fish oil also increases fatty acid oxidation by peroxisomal and mitochondrial routes, reduce fatty acid synthesis, divert fatty acids into phospholipid synthesis, increase hepatic uptake of triglycerides, and down-regulate fatty acid esterifying enzymes ( 5707 ). There is some evidence that vitamin B12 used with fish oil might have additive effects in lowering cholesterol, but the mechanism for this effect is unknown ( 8894 ). Fish oil also improves flow-mediated arterial dilation in people with hypercholesterolemia ( 5702 ). Unlike some other kinds of dietary fat, omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil do not seem to impair endothelial function, which is thought to be a precursor to atherogenesis ( 5702 , 7382 ). It was initially suggested that fish oil fatty acids are utilized in the liver for the synthesis of phospholipids, located on the surface of lipoproteins ( 66324 ). However, in the majority of studies reporting reductions in total cholesterol and LDL, saturated fat intake was lowered when switching from a control diet to a fish oil diet. When fish oil was administered to subjects under constant saturated fat intake, there was no effect on total cholesterol levels ( 66222 ). Nevertheless, there were reports that even under such rigorously controlled conditions (e.g., at low and high fixed concentrations of saturated fatty acids), fish oil was capable of lowering plasma total cholesterol, VLDL, and LDL ( 66394 , 66214 , 59271 ). In hens, fish oil increased expression of some PPAR-alpha target genes and decreased the nuclear concentration of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP)-2 in the liver ( 45397 ). PPAR-alpha activation has been shown to reduce cholesterol synthesis by reducing SREBP-2 abundance. There is interest in using fish oil in combination with "statin" drugs for mixed hyperlipidemia patients. There has been concern about whether taking fish oil might interfere with statin therapy. Preliminary evidence shows that fish oil does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of the statin drug simvastatin ( 15116 ). Musculoskeletal effects Fish oil has been tried for improving muscle growth in elderly people and improving muscular performance in athletes during exercise. This is because the anti-inflammatory effects of fish oils are thought to inhibit muscle damage after exercise, allowing for more muscular growth. Evidence from a small clinical trial shows that consuming fish oil containing 600 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 260 mg of docosahexaenoic acid daily for 8 weeks seems to improve maximal voluntary contraction, muscle soreness and range of motion compared to placebo in healthy men performing eccentric contraction exercise ( 98257 ). Other preliminary research in untrained adult males shows that taking fish oil daily for 4 to 6 weeks lowers plasma creatine kinase, and possibly lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 levels, when compared with control or placebo ( 111450 , 114188 ). However, other clinical research in trained males shows that taking fish oil 5 grams, containing EPA 1882 mg and DHA 485 mg, orally daily for 4 weeks does not lower plasma creatine kinase levels after eccentric exercises when compared with placebo ( 111451 ). Neurologic/psychiatric effects In depression, omega-3s might normalize altered neuronal membrane microstructure and faulty neurotransmission. Omega-3s might also play a role in correcting defects in the arachidonic acid cascade, which is involved in second messenger processes that affect neurotransmitter uptake ( 10871 ). A diet deficient in omega-3 fatty acids may affect the fatty acid composition of cells in the central nervous system and alter neural function, including intellectual or cognitive development. Reduced omega-3 fatty acid levels have been reported in people with schizophrenia, and it is suggested that dysfunctional fatty acid metabolism contributes to the disorder. Omega-3 fatty acids might alter membrane fluidity and receptor responses when incorporated into cell membranes, and they might interact with dopaminergic and serotonergic systems ( 17084 ). Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids 2.2 grams daily for 26 weeks modestly improves symptoms and also seems to attenuate loss of cortical brain thickness compared to placebo in patients with schizophrenia ( 97183 , 97184 ). DHA is thought to be important for normal neural function and might play a key role in the structural development of neural and synaptic membranes ( 8704 , 8705 , 8803 ). There is preliminary evidence that low levels of omega-3 fatty acids, especially DHA, might affect retinal, visual, learning, and memory function ( 8704 , 8705 , 8715 ). However, omega-3 fatty acids might be beneficial only up to a point. Taking fish oil seems to improve the processing of information by the brain during cognitive tasks ( 109310 ). In individuals with bipolar disorder, the fatty acids in fish oil are thought to have an effect similar to lithium or valproate, slowing nerve signaling ( 7202 ). Although some conflicting evidence exists ( 65821 ), several studies suggest that moderate consumption of fish or increased omega-3 intake is associated with a reduced risk of neuropsychiatric disorders including depression ( 65767 , 65794 ). An inverse correlation between intake of omega-3 fatty acids and severity of depression has also been noted ( 10859 ). Also, a positive correlation between the ratio of erythrocyte phospholipid arachidonic acid to EPA and depression severity has also been observed ( 65867 , 65934 , 66410 ). In addition, low levels of DHA and elevated omega-6:omega-3 ratios have been shown to be associated with predicted suicide, depressive symptomology, and neuroticism ( 65713 , 65815 ). A greater frequency of behavior problems assessed by the Conner Rating Scale, temper tantrums and sleep disturbances have been registered in young males with lower total omega-3 fatty acids in plasma phospholipids ( 66413 ). Also, fish oil has been proposed as a treatment for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) due to epidemiological data that suggests symptoms of ADHD might be inversely related to the omega 3-fatty acid phospholipid content ( 5711 ). Omega-3 fatty acids are also of interest for their neuroprotective effects related to neuropathies. Clinical research in patients with type 1 diabetes shows that taking fish oil for 6 months improves the length of the central corneal nerve fiber ( 106072 ). Renal effects In 10 young healthy subjects whose diets were supplemented daily with omega-3 PUFAs 6 grams containing EPA 3.6 grams and DHA 2.4 grams, a significant increase in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate, as well as decreased vascular resistance, occurred ( 66195 ). However, no such effects were observed in elderly subjects who took EPA 1.7 grams daily for 4 weeks ( 66466 ). Respiratory effects There is interest in using fish oil to protect the lungs from pollution. A small clinical trial in young adults with low omega-3 status shows that, when compared with olive oil or no supplement, taking fish oil (Pharmavite, LLC) 3 grams daily for 4 weeks has a modest protective effect on lung function during an acute exposure to air containing ozone 300 ppb. Each gram of fish oil provided eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 410 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 274 mg as ethyl ester ( 109291 ). Weight loss effects Although there is interest in using fish oil to improve weight loss, most clinical research shows that fish oil supplements are not effective in overweight or obese individuals ( 15737 , 66004 , 89355 , 89356 , 100247 , 100250 , 106073 ). However, taking fish oil has been shown to increase the resting metabolic rate in overweight and obese adults ( 107177 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Likely Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Fish%20Oil</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Effective Hypertriglyceridemia. Oral prescription fish oil products reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, especially in severe cases. Oral fish oil supplements may reduce triglyceride levels when used in very high doses of up to 12 capsules per dose. Fish oil can reduce triglyceride levels by 20% to 50% ( 1024 , 2299 , 2300 , 2301 , 2302 , 2315 , 2317 , 5702 , 5705 , 5706 )( 6394 , 6399 , 7368 , 7369 , 7380 , 12921 , 12922 , 13011 , 13766 , 65846 )( 66154 , 65504 , 66370 , 66156 , 66338 , 65589 , 66221 , 66257 , 66278 , 98004 , 100253 ). The effect is dose-dependent and greatest in individuals with severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride levels of 500 mg/dL and above) ( 5706 , 7380 , 65846 , 66278 , 100253 ). However, fish oil might be less effective than fibrates. One clinical study shows that fish oil in doses of 4 grams daily is not as effective as gemfibrozil (Lopid) 1200 mg daily ( 7377 ). For patients with hypertriglyceridemia associated with the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (ALP), which is thought to be a marker for cardiovascular disease, taking fish oil 6 grams daily might reduce triglyceride levels by 35% ( 8683 ). Preliminary clinical research shows that taking the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil might also reduce fatty liver disease and serum transaminase levels associated with hypertriglyceridemia ( 13755 ). Three specific fish oil preparations (Lovaza, formerly known as Omacor, GlaxoSmithKline; Omtryg, Trygg Pharma, Inc.; Epanova, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals), are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as an adjunct to diet to lower triglyceride levels in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia ( 12982 , 96117 ). These prescription-only products are typically used at dosages of 4 grams providing 3.4-3.6 grams of omega-3 fatty acids daily ( 98004 ). When a 4-gram daily dose is used, triglycerides are lowered by about 20% to 30%. When a 2-gram daily dose is used, the triglyceride-lowering effect is reduced by about half ( 100253 ). In 2019, the American Heart Association (AHA) stated that prescription fish oil products, taken in doses of 4 grams daily, are clinically useful for lowering triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or severe hypertriglyceridemia ( 100253 ). Fish oil supplements have also shown benefit in clinical research when used in doses ranging from 1-15 grams daily for up to 6 months, or when providing EPA 1.45 to 2.7 grams and DHA 1.05 to 1.8 grams daily for 2 to 12 weeks ( 1024 , 2301 , 2315 , 2317 , 5705 , 5707 , 6394 , 6399 , 7368 , 7369 )( 8683 , 13766 , 65589 , 66156 , 66257 , 66370 ). However, some experts view these forms of fish oil as inadequate, as the omega-3 fatty acid content of fish oil supplements is usually lower and often variable compared to prescription fish oil. Often, up to 12 capsules of fish oil supplements daily may be needed to produce the same triglyceride-lowering effect as prescription fish oil ( 98004 ). In 2019, the AHA did not recommend for or against the use of fish oil supplements for hypertriglyceridemia ( 100253 ). There is limited evidence regarding the effects of fish oil in younger patients with hypertriglyceridemia ( 100253 ). Two small clinical studies in adolescents with hypertriglyceridemia show that fish oil supplements 4 grams daily for 2-6 months do not reduce triglyceride levels when compared with placebo ( 89339 , 100253 ). However, the lack of benefit in this patient population might be due to the small study sizes or due to potential underlying genetic resistance to treatment. more Possibly Effective Angioplasty. Oral fish oil seems to prevent restenosis when started at least 3 weeks before percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking fish oil orally prevents restenosis after PTCA ( 13750 , 66376 , 65569 ). Also, clinical research shows that fish oil decreases restenosis rate by up to 45% when given for at least three weeks before PTCA and continued for one month thereafter ( 8680 , 65614 ). In these clinical trials, two different dosing regimens were used; fish oil 6 grams daily starting at least one month before PTCA and continuing one month after PTCA, followed by 3 grams of fish oil daily for 6 months thereafter ( 8680 ); and fifteen 1 gram capsules of fish oil (containing 2.7 grams of EPA 1.8 grams of DHA daily) daily starting 3 weeks before PTCA and continuing for 6 months thereafter ( 65614 ). When given for two weeks or less before PTCA, fish oil doesn't seem to have any effect on restenosis ( 1028 , 1038 , 2320 , 65462 , 66390 , 65626 , 66203 , 66212 ), although some conflicting evidence exists ( 66202 ). more Cachexia. Oral fish oil in doses of 7.5-8.1 grams daily seems to slow weight loss in patients with cachexia. Lower doses might not be effective. Taking a high-dose fish oil supplement seems to slow weight loss in some patients with cancer-related cachexia ( 11979 , 62390 ). Lower doses (3 grams daily) do not seem to have any effect ( 10008 ). Higher doses (7.5-8.1 grams daily) have come from a specific fish oil preparation (ACO Omega-3, Pharmacia) 30 mL providing EPA 4.9 grams and DHA 3.2 grams daily for 4 weeks ( 62390 ), or fish oil 7.5 grams daily providing EPA 4.7 grams and DHA 2.8 grams for a median of 5 weeks ( 11979 ). There is also preliminary evidence that a product providing protein 32 grams, EPA 2.18 grams, and DHA 1.92 grams daily for up to 7 weeks might help to improve appetite and increase lean body mass in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer ( 5701 ). In contrast, a meta-analysis of three studies in cancer patients shows that taking fish oil for 4-25 weeks does not seem to prevent loss of fat-free mass or body weight, or prevent a decrease in upper arm circumference, when compared with placebo. However, it is unclear how many of the included patients had malnutrition and/or weight loss ( 106070 ). more Cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity. Oral fish oil seems to prevent cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity. Some clinical research shows that taking fish oil orally seems to significantly improve glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow in individuals taking cyclosporine after kidney or liver transplant ( 1021 , 66187 ). Taking fish oil orally also seems to improve kidney function during the recovery phase following a rejection episode in kidney transplant recipients taking cyclosporine when compared with coconut oil ( 65590 ). In addition, another clinical study shows that taking fish oil modestly improves kidney function in patients following a recent kidney transplant ( 66472 ). Doses used in these studies include fish oil 12 grams, containing 18% EPA and 12% DHA, daily for 2 months following liver transplant or fish oil 3-6 grams, usually containing 30% EPA and 20% DHA, daily for up to 12 months following kidney transplant ( 1021 , 66187 , 65590 , 66472 ). more Dysmenorrhea. Oral fish oil seems to reduce symptoms of dysmenorrhea. Clinical research in adolescents and adults with dysmenorrhea shows that taking fish oil, alone or in combination with vitamin B1 100 mg, vitamin B12 11 mcg, or vitamin E 1.5 mg or 200 IU, seems to decrease pain, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) consumption, and interference with daily activities ( 7574 , 7575 , 15738 , 89341 , 99367 , 107174 ). Doses of fish oil used in these studies provided EPA 1080 mg and DHA 720 mg daily for up to 2 months or EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg daily for 5 days ( 7574 , 99367 ). Alternatively, fish oil 2.5 grams daily for 3-4 months or 500 mg daily for 2 months has been used ( 7575 , 89341 ). more Heart failure. Dietary fish oil seems to prevent heart failure. Also, oral fish oil seems to prevent further hospitalization, and possibly mortality, in patients with heart failure. Dietary fish oil might be beneficial for primary prevention of heart failure. Population research found that higher intake of DIETARY fish oil is associated with a 15% reduced risk of incident heart failure ( 17994 ). Based on this data and other population research, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that patients consume 1-2 weekly servings of non-fried fish in place of less healthy protein options to reduce the risk of congestive heart failure ( 97185 ). There is not enough available information to know if fish oil SUPPLEMENTS are beneficial for primary prevention of heart failure ( 93568 ). However, taking fish oil supplements seems to be beneficial for secondary prevention of outcomes in patients with heart failure. A large population study in patients with heart failure suggests that regular use of fish oil supplements is associated with a modest reduction in mortality when compared with non-use of fish oil supplements ( 114182 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 600-4300 mg orally daily for up to 12 months can improve left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac function in patients with non-ischemic chronic heart failure ( 89373 ). Another meta-analysis shows that although taking omega-3 fatty acids 961-6000 mg orally daily for up to 6.2 years does not reduce cardiovascular mortality or first hospitalization due to heart failure, recurrent hospitalizations due to heart failure were reduced by approximately 9% when compared with placebo ( 106061 ). A large-scale clinical trial (GISSI-HF) also shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily, providing 850-882 mg of EPA and DHA as ethyl esters in a ratio of 1:1.2, for an average of 3.9 years significantly reduces the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization in patients with New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure. Based on these findings, approximately 56 patients would need to be treated for 3.9 years to prevent one death. Approximately 44 patients would need to be treated for 3.9 years to prevent one cardiovascular-related death or hospitalization ( 16733 ). Based on these findings, an AHA science advisory states that it is reasonable to consider supplementation with fish oil 1 gram daily in patients with heart failure ( 93568 ). more HIV/AIDS-related dyslipidemia. Oral fish oil seems to reduce triglyceride levels in patients with this condition. It is unclear if oral fish oil reduces levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in these patients. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that supplementation with fish oil reduces triglycerides by 12-99 mg/dL in patients with HIV treatment-related dyslipidemia when compared to control ( 66177 , 66144 , 65993 ). Two capsules of a specific fish oil supplement (Omacor, Pronova BioPharma) containing EPA 460 mg plus DHA 380 mg twice daily for 12 weeks has been used in one study ( 65993 ). The effect of fish oil on total cholesterol levels is mixed, with some evidence showing a decrease in total cholesterol of 14 mg/dL ( 66177 ), while other evidence suggests that fish oil does not affect total cholesterol levels in these patients ( 65993 , 89359 ). An observational cohort study has found that taking fish oil is associated with reduced triglyceride levels in patients with HIV and hypertriglyceridemia, with overall effects similar to statins but less than fibrates ( 89354 ). more Hypertension. Oral fish oil seems to reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults with moderate or severe hypertension. It is unclear if oral fish oil reduces blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension or in those using antihypertensive drugs. Most clinical research shows that taking fish oil produces modest but significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in adults with moderate or severe hypertension ( 1020 , 2301 , 66215 , 66095 ). In patients with mild hypertension, however, the evidence is mixed ( 1001 , 66385 , 66180 ). The discrepancy regarding the hypotensive effect of fish oil in individuals with mild hypertension may result from the type of fish oil used for treatment ( 66180 ). Meta-analyses of clinical research suggest that, in general, fish oil reduces systolic blood pressure by 2.5-5.5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 1.5-3.5 mmHg in individuals with hypertension ( 66358 , 66379 , 89324 , 89350 ). In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed a qualified health claim stating that consuming EPA and DHA in combination may be beneficial for moderating blood pressure and reducing the risk of hypertension in the general population. However, the FDA noted that this claim is based on inconsistent and inconclusive evidence ( 102372 ). It is unclear whether fish oil is beneficial in people who are already using antihypertensive drugs. Some clinical research suggests that taking fish oil 5 grams daily for 6 weeks does not further improve the hypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors in individuals being treated for hypertension ( 66359 ), while other research suggests that fish oil decreases systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive individuals currently taking beta-blockers or diuretics ( 66331 , 66100 ). However, taking fish oil does not seem to significantly improve blood pressure in individuals with hypertension that remains uncontrolled despite the use of antihypertensive drugs ( 66418 ). Clinical trials showing blood pressure-lowering effects have used fish oil 4-15 grams daily, in single or divided doses, for up to 36 weeks, or fish oil providing EPA 2.04 grams and DHA 1.4 grams daily ( 1001 , 1020 , 2301 , 66100 , 66180 , 66331 , 66385 ). Omega-3 fatty acids 3-15 grams daily for 4 weeks have also been used ( 66215 ). There is conflicting evidence regarding whether the hypotensive effect of fish oil is dose-dependent ( 66358 , 66379 , 89350 ). Other research has assessed whether fish oil affects the risk of developing additional cardiometabolic disorders in adults with hypertension. In a cohort of over 81,500 patients followed for 9 years, those who consumed fish oil as supplements or in the diet at baseline had a 9%, 11%, and 14% reduction, respectively, in the risk for diabetes, coronary heart disease, and cardiac death, when compared with those with hypertension who did not consume fish oil ( 108508 ). more IgA nephropathy. When used for 2-4 years, oral fish oil seems to slow the rate of renal function loss in high-risk patients. It is unclear if oral fish oil slows renal function loss when used for shorter time periods or in low-risk patients. Some clinical research shows that long-term use (2-4 years) of fish oil 1-12 grams daily can slow the rate of renal function loss in high-risk patients with IgA nephropathy ( 8686 , 8711 , 66343 , 65615 ). However, short-term use may not be as effective. Some research shows that fish oil 4-6 grams daily for 6 months does not attenuate the loss of renal function ( 66351 , 65593 ), although a combination of fish oil 3 grams containing 85% EPA plus DHA daily plus renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASB) for 6 months seems to reduce proteinuria in patients with IgA nephropathy when compared with RASB alone ( 65887 ). The conflicting data regarding the effect of fish oil on IgA nephropathy has been attributed to different factors. One analysis of clinical evidence suggests that the effects of fish oil on proteinuria in patients with IgA nephropathy is dose-dependent ( 65792 ). Another analysis suggests that the effect of fish oil may be beneficial in only IgA nephropathy patients with more proteinuria ( 66455 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral fish oil seems to reduce liver steatosis in adults and children with NAFLD. Meta-analyses of mainly small clinical studies show that taking omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil or seal oil reduces serum liver enzymes and liver fat when compared with control treatment in patients with NAFLD ( 98258 , 103498 ). However, these analyses are limited by the heterogeneity and small size of the available studies. In one small clinical trial not included in these analyses, taking fish oil providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 735 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 1605 mg daily for 3 months modestly reduces triglyceride levels and waist circumference when compared with control. However, insulin and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were only reduced when fish oil was used in combination with vitamin D 1680 IU daily. There was no effect of fish oil on other liver, glycemic, or lipid parameters ( 107186 ). In one meta-analysis, omega-3 fatty acids such as fish oil were used in a median dose of 2.7 grams daily for an average of 6 months ( 98258 ). Omega-3 fatty acids such as fish oil might also benefit children with NAFLD. A meta-analysis of three small clinical trials shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids modestly improves steatosis grade in children with NAFLD when compared with placebo ( 98241 ). Larger studies are needed to confirm these results. Also review effectiveness in MASLD, a similar condition. more Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral fish oil seems to reduce pain and stiffness in patients with RA; however, oral fish oil does not seem to be beneficial for RA prevention when used alone. Taking fish oil orally, alone or in combination with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen, seems to significantly decrease the duration of morning stiffness and the number of tender joints in patients with RA ( 1017 , 1039 , 1041 , 12924 , 12925 , 15738 , 65629 , 66313 , 66352 , 66191 ) ( 66248 ). Use of fish oil might also reduce NSAID requirements when used concomitantly ( 1031 , 15738 , 65610 ). Also, taking omega-3 fatty acids 5.5 grams daily for 12 months upon initiating treatment with methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine may slow time to conventional therapy failure and decrease time to first remission in patients with early onset RA ( 89362 ). In this clinical research, fish oil 10 grams daily for 6 months or fish oil preparations containing EPA 0.5-4.6 grams and DHA 0.2-3 grams, sometimes along with vitamin E 15 IU, have been used daily for up to 15 months ( 1017 , 1031 , 1039 , 1041 , 12924 , 12925 , 15738 , 65610 , 66352 , 66191 , 66248 ). The effect of oral fish oil on RA prevention has also been investigated in a large clinical trial of approximately 25,000 older adults. Taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 5 years providing EPA 0.46 grams and DHA 0.38 grams does not reduce the risk of developing definite or probable RA when compared with placebo. However, the risk of RA is reduced by 77% when fish oil is taken in combination with vitamin D3 2000 IU daily ( 107184 ). Although this study was large, the primary endpoint was the effect of taking fish oil and/or vitamin D on the development of autoimmune diseases as a group. The number of patients with a specific autoimmune disease such as RA was relatively small. more Gastroenteritis-associated nausea and vomiting . Oral fish oil during pregnancy seems to be beneficial for preventing gastroenteritis in early childhood. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for gastroenteritis prevention or treatment in children or adults. Clinical research shows that taking fish oil 2.4 grams daily (Incromega TG33/22, Croda Health Care), containing 55% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 37% docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), from week 24 of pregnancy until one week postpartum reduces the number of days of gastroenteritis in the first 3 years of the child's life by 2.5 days or 14% when compared with an olive oil control. There was also a 16% reduction in the number of gastroenteritis episodes and a 20% reduced risk of having a gastroenteritis episode. A sub-analysis suggests that benefits are limited to the winter months and to the children of mothers with the lowest blood levels of EPA and DHA ( 107182 ). More research is needed to determine the effect of fish oil in children or adults. more Possibly Ineffective Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral fish oil does not seem to prevent the incidence or progression of AMD. However, eating fish regularly might help to reduce the risk of AMD. The best available clinical research shows that fish oil supplements (Omacor) are not beneficial for preventing AMD or its progression. A large, high-quality clinical study in over 25,800 adults at least 50 years of age shows that taking fish oil providing DHA 450 mg and EPA 550 mg daily for 3.8 to 6.1 years, with or without vitamin D, does not prevent AMD or its progression ( 105214 ). Other clinical research shows that taking fish oil containing DHA 350 mg and EPA 650 mg daily for up to 6.1 years does not prevent the development of advanced AMD ( 60281 ). Also, clinical research shows that taking fish oil containing DHA 840 mg and EPA 270 mg by mouth daily for 3 years does not prevent choroidal neovascularization in patients with AMD ( 89369 ). However, regular consumption of fish might be beneficial for preventing the incidence or progression of AMD. Observational research has found that consuming dietary fish more than once weekly is associated with a reduced risk of developing age-related maculopathy or AMD ( 6260 , 65724 , 65725 , 65889 ). Also, a meta-analysis of observational research has found a 6% and 22% decreased risk of early or late AMD, respectively, for every gram increase in dietary omega-3 fatty acid intake, and a 13% and 14% decreased risk, respectively, for every 15-gram daily increase in fish intake. Sub-analyses found 9% to 15% decreased risks for early or late AMD per 0.15 grams daily of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), but not alpha-linolenic acid. Although research examining the relationship between omega-3 intake and AMD progression is limited, the highest consumption of dietary fish is associated with a 36% lower risk of AMD progression when compared with the lowest consumption ( 107176 ). more Angina. Oral fish oil does not seem to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with angina. Clinical research shows that taking fish oil supplements does not improve mortality or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with angina ( 66255 ). In fact, some evidence suggests that fish oil supplements or increasing oily fish intake might increase the risk of cardiac death by 26% and sudden cardiac death by 54% in males with angina ( 17988 ). More evidence is needed before this potential risk can be confirmed. more Atherosclerosis. Oral fish oil does not seem to attenuate atherosclerosis progression. Most research shows that fish oil supplementation does not attenuate atherosclerosis progression when compared with placebo ( 1022 , 8681 ). Also, fish oil doesn't seem to improve luminal diameter ( 1022 , 2311 ) or decrease intima-media thickness of the carotid arteries in people with coronary artery disease (CAD) ( 8681 ). However, some research disagrees. One clinical study in adults with CAD shows that taking fish oil supplements 6 grams daily for 3 months and then 3 grams daily for 21 months modestly slows the progression, or causes mild to moderate regression, of atherosclerosis as measured by angiography ( 2311 ). more Atopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral fish oil does not seem to treat or prevent atopic dermatitis. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that fish oil is not effective for TREATING established atopic dermatitis ( 13758 , 66151 , 13758 ). Also, despite conflicting results from preliminary clinical research ( 12971 , 17409 ), higher quality clinical studies show that fish oil does not PREVENT eczema development. A meta-analysis of clinical research, as well as results from more recent clinical trials, show that maternal supplementation or infant supplementation with fish oil does not reduce the risk of eczema development in infants or young children ( 66112 , 89338 , 89360 , 89361 , 96120 ). However, a secondary analysis of one of these clinical studies suggests that the risk may vary by maternal genotype ( 115737 ). However, some population research suggests that eating fish in early childhood is associated with a reduced risk of developing childhood eczema ( 65992 ). more Atrial fibrillation. Oral fish oil does not seem to reduce the risk of new or recurrent atrial fibrillation. Some clinical research suggests that high-dose fish oil may actually increase the risk for new atrial fibrillation. Although some population research has found that consuming fish as part of the diet is associated with a reduced risk of atrial fibrillation ( 12055 ), most evidence from epidemiological and clinical research suggests that eating fatty fish or taking fish oil supplements does not reduce the risk of new onset or recurrent atrial fibrillation ( 12919 , 17995 , 66101 , 89357 , 105209 , 106075 , 107171 , 107181 , 109306 , 110332 ). Recent research suggests that consuming fish oil increases the risk of atrial fibrillation, particularly at higher doses. In 2023, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency issued a public statement on the use of omega-3-acid ethyl esters, concluding that exposure to omega-3-acid ethyl esters for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of atrial fibrillation in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or risk factors for CVD when compared with placebo. The highest risk of atrial fibrillation is associated with a dose of 4 grams daily ( 112467 ). Additionally, one large, high-quality clinical study (the STRENGTH trial) in patients at high risk for CVD shows that taking a prescription fish oil product (Epanova) 4 grams daily for up to 5 years is associated with an increased risk for atrial fibrillation, with a number needed to harm of 114 when compared with a corn oil control ( 103491 ). Meta-analyses and a large epidemiological study suggest that taking fish oil supplements at doses over 1 gram daily is associated with a 25% to 37% increased risk of atrial fibrillation in individuals with or without CVD, including those with risk factors for CVD, regardless of genetic predisposition ( 106075 , 107171 , 107181 , 109306 ). The available meta-analyses are limited by the small number of studies in which atrial fibrillation is the primary endpoint, possibly over-estimating the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplements on atrial fibrillation ( 110332 , 103491 ). Fish oil also seems to increase the risk of atrial fibrillation after myocardial infarction. In a secondary analysis of the Omega-3 fatty acids in Elderly patients with Myocardial Infarction (OMEMI) trial, adults aged 70-82 years old with recent myocardial infarction supplementing with 1.8 grams daily of omega-3 fatty acid supplements for 24 months had a 90% increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation or micro-atrial fibrillation, which is characterized by short, atrial fibrillation-like activity lasting less than 30 seconds. Changes in serum EPA levels seem to mediate this risk, with higher serum EPA levels predictive of an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and intermediate serum EPA levels predictive of an increased risk of micro-atrial fibrillation ( 112469 ). There is conflicting evidence regarding the effects of fish oil on recurrent atrial fibrillation following cardioversion. Some clinical research shows that taking fish oil 6 grams daily by mouth for one month prior to cardioversion and continuing for up to one year thereafter reduces the absolute risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence by about 39% when compared with placebo ( 89344 ). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that fish oil does not reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation following cardioversion ( 89325 ). A reason for this discrepancy may be the duration of fish oil supplementation prior to cardioversion. Taking fish oil for at least 4 weeks before cardioversion appears to decrease the absolute risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation by about 18% when compared with placebo, whereas taking fish oil for less than 4 weeks before cardioversion appears to increase the absolute risk of atrial fibrillation by about 6% ( 89325 ). Most clinical research shows that fish oil does not decrease the risk of atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery ( 17996 , 89352 , 89374 ). However, it is possible that fish oil formulations containing at least 1 gram of DHA may be beneficial. Evidence from clinical research and analysis of clinical data shows that taking fish oil containing DHA 1 gram or more reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery by about 37% to 72% ( 89374 , 96113 ). Fish oil containing lower doses of DHA does not appear to be beneficial ( 89374 ). A science advisory statement published by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 2017 states that fish oil is not indicated for secondary prevention of atrial fibrillation in patients with prior atrial fibrillation or those with atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. The cumulative evidence showed no benefit of fish oil in these populations ( 93568 ). more Bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oral fish oil does not seem to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. A meta-analysis of the available clinical research in over 3,500 preterm infants shows that receiving fish oil daily as part of formula or as a direct oral dose, starting within one month of birth, does not reduce the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia when compared with control ( 102390 ). more Cerebrovascular disease. Oral fish oil does not seem to prevent cerebrovascular disease. Although a meta-analysis of population studies has found that increased fish consumption lowers the risk of cerebrovascular disease, results from a pooled analysis of clinical trials show that fish oil supplementation does not reduce the risk of primary or secondary cerebrovascular disease ( 89334 ). more Cognitive function. Oral fish oil does not seem to improve cognitive function in most people. Most clinical research shows that fish oil supplementation does NOT improve cognitive function in healthy elderly individuals, elderly patients with self-reported cognitive decline, or adults and children ( 65880 , 66030 , 66492 , 97175 , 98248 , 103501 , 109310 ). However, fish oil supplementation may modestly help older patients with self-reported cognitive decline to perform daily activities ( 97181 ). Also, clinical research in young and middle-aged adults shows that taking a fish oil supplement providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 900 mg plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 360 mg (Accelon EPA EE, BASF) daily for 6 months improves some measures of cognitive function, including overall speed and overall and memory-related accuracy, when compared with both placebo or a fish oil supplement providing DHA 900 mg and EPA 270 mg daily (Accelon DHA EE, BASF). There were no benefits on other measures of cognitive performance ( 109215 ). This suggests that any beneficial effects associated with fish oil might be related to the levels or ratio of EPA to DHA or the specific endpoints measured. Observational research has also found conflicting associations between dietary fish and fish oil intake and cognitive function ( 13747 , 15740 , 15741 , 15742 ). more Helicobacter pylori. Oral fish oil does not seem to aid in the Helicobacter pylori eradication. Clinical research shows that taking fish oil (Eicosapen) orally, in combination with pantoprazole and clarithromycin, is inferior for eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection when compared with a combination of pantoprazole, clarithromycin, and metronidazole ( 8710 ). more Kidney transplant. Oral fish oil does not seem to improve survival or rejection rate following a kidney transplant. A meta-analysis of a small number of clinical studies shows that taking fish oil does not improve patient survival, graft survival, or acute rejection rates when compared with placebo following kidney transplant ( 96121 ). more Mastalgia. Oral fish oil does not seem to reduce chronic breast pain. Clinical research shows that taking fish oil orally 3 grams daily for 6 months does not improve severe chronic breast pain when compared with placebo ( 9156 ). more Multiple sclerosis (MS). Oral fish oil does not seem to improve symptoms in patients with MS. Clinical research shows that taking fish oil (MaxEPA) 10 grams containing EPA 1.71 grams and DHA 1.14 grams daily for 2 years does not improve the duration, frequency, or severity of relapses when compared with placebo in patients with MS ( 66205 ). Also, in patients with relapsing remitting MS who are taking the medication fingolimod, taking fish oil 1 gram, providing EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg, daily for 12 months does not improve levels of inflammatory markers or symptoms of disability when compared with placebo ( 103502 ). more Osteoarthritis. Oral fish oil does not seem to improve pain or function in patients with osteoarthritis. However, oral fish oil might be beneficial for osteoarthritis-related joint pain in overweight patients. Clinical research shows that patients with osteoarthritis or knee pain taking low-dose fish oil 0.45 grams daily for 2 years have better pain and function scores when compared with those taking high-dose fish oil 4.5 grams daily ( 97179 ). The unexpected improvement in pain and function score in the low-dose fish oil group might be due to a placebo effect. Other clinical research shows that adding fish oil 444 mg to a glucosamine sulfate supplement does not further decrease osteoarthritis symptoms, such as morning stiffness or pain in the hips and knees, when compared with glucosamine alone ( 65998 ). In addition, one large study shows that taking fish oil (Omacor) 1 gram daily for an average of 5.3 years has no effect on knee pain due to osteoarthritis when compared with placebo ( 101548 ). In contrast to these findings, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking fish oil seems to reduce joint pain ( 106066 ). However, only two studies were included in this analysis and both used fish oil in combination with other ingredients, including stinging nettle ( 76415 ) and lemon verbena ( 17748 ). In addition, one of these studies did not limit to patients with osteoarthritis ( 17748 ). Due to the overall negative findings, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) conditionally recommends AGAINST the use of fish oil in patients with knee, hip, or hand osteoarthritis ( 102114 ). Taking fish oil might be beneficial for joint pain reduction in a population of older overweight or obese patients with osteoarthritis-specific pain in the knees, lower back, or shoulders. Clinical research shows that taking fish oil (Blackmores Omega Brain) providing EPA 400 mg and DHA 2000 mg daily for 16 weeks reduces pain by approximately 42%. This is significantly greater than placebo. The overall osteoarthritis burden was reduced by about 40% ( 103499 ). more Pre-eclampsia. Oral fish oil does not seem to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia. A meta-analysis of 16 moderate-quality, mostly randomized controlled studies in adults shows that taking fish oil 1-3 grams daily, starting in the 12 th to 20 th week of gestation, reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia when compared with placebo ( 115741 ). However, some individual clinical studies show that fish oil does not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia ( 1042 , 89376 , 97174 , 110338 ). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be related to the heterogeneous methods across clinical studies, including dose, duration, and timing of therapy initiation. more Pregnancy-induced hypertension. Oral fish oil does not seem to reduce the risk for hypertension during pregnancy. Clinical research shows that fish oil does not reduce the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension ( 1026 , 1027 , 12972 , 97174 , 110338 ). more Psychosis. Most research shows that oral fish oil is not beneficial for the treatment or prevention of psychosis. Although some individual research shows that taking fish oil modestly reduces symptoms of psychosis and the absolute conversion rate to psychotic disorders ( 17084 ), most research disagrees ( 105217 , 105554 , 109308 ). A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in patients with psychosis shows that taking fish oil does not reduce psychotic symptoms when compared with placebo. However, it might modestly improve function ( 109308 ). Doses of fish oil used in the available research have ranged from 570 mg to 3000 mg daily for up to 1 year ( 17084 , 105554 , 109308 ). more Unstable angina. Oral fish oil does not seem to prevent unstable angina. In patients at high cardiovascular risk, taking a fish oil-based preparation (Epanova, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals) 4 grams daily for up to 5 years does not prevent unstable angina requiring hospitalization ( 103491 ). more Ventricular arrhythmias. Oral fish oil does not seem to prevent ventricular arrhythmias or prevent mortality in patients with a history of ventricular arrhythmias. Epidemiological research suggests that eating a diet high in fish has no effect on risk for premature ventricular complexes ( 12920 ). Clinical research is inconsistent. In one clinical trial, taking fish oil 2.6 grams daily did not prolong the time to the first event, such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or death, in patients with implantable defibrillators. However, in the subgroup of patients who adhered to therapy for a full 11 months, fish oil treatment did seem to significantly prolong time to first event ( 14436 ). Other clinical evidence suggests that taking fish oil 2 grams daily for 1-2 years does not reduce cardiac events such as cardiac defibrillation, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, or death from any cause in patients with implantable defibrillators ( 12986 , 14382 ). Also, other research suggests that taking fish oil supplements might actually increase the risk of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation in some patients with implantable defibrillators ( 12986 ). Overall, meta-analyses of clinical studies show that taking fish oil does not reduce implantable defibrillator events for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in patients with an implantable defibrillator or all-cause mortality in patients with an implantable defibrillator or history of ventricular arrhythmias ( 16732 , 65923 , 89343 , 114186 ). more Likely Ineffective Diabetes. Oral fish oil does not improve glycemic control or prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, oral fish oil may lower triglyceride levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Clinical research shows that taking fish oil may reduce triglyceride levels in patients with diabetes ( 65577 , 65834 , 65878 , 66027 , 66436 , 66444 , 101538 , 101541 , 113215 ). However, although some individual studies disagree, most clinical research shows that taking fish oil has no clinically significant effect on fasting plasma glucose levels or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 2299 , 2300 , 2302 , 7368 , 7369 , 12182 , 12925 , 13011 , 13147 , 13149 )( 65577 , 65834 , 65878 , 66316 , 66372 , 66426 , 66442 , 101504 , 101541 , 101542 )( 113212 ). A large, high-quality clinical study also shows that taking fish oil 840 mg daily with or without aspirin for an average of 7.4 years does not decrease the risk for serious vascular complications, including myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack (TIA), when compared with placebo ( 102401 ). However, observational research in adults over 60 years of age with diabetes suggests that habitual use of fish oil supplements is associated with a 24% lower risk of dementia over about 7 years when compared with not using fish oil. Consumption of oily or non-oily fish is not associated with dementia risk in individuals with diabetes ( 113213 ). Fish oil is also of interest for gestational diabetes. Taking fish oil does not seem to reduce the risk of gestational diabetes ( 89376 , 97174 , 110338 ). Also, taking fish oil does not seem to have beneficial effects on levels of fasting blood glucose during pregnancy in patients with or without any type of diabetes, including gestational diabetes ( 113211 ). One clinical trial shows that increased blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids following fish oil supplementation during pregnancy are associated with an increased odds of gestational diabetes. However, this association was no longer significant after taking dietary total and saturated fat into consideration ( 113222 ). However, a meta-analysis of 3 small clinical trials in patients with gestational diabetes shows that taking fish oil for 6 weeks during pregnancy modestly improves insulin resistance ( 113211 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is unclear if enteral fish oil is beneficial in patients with ARDS. The effect of enteral fish oil, with or without borage oil and antioxidants, has been evaluated for improving outcomes in patients with ARDS. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating these ingredients, provided as a specific enteral formula (Oxepa, Abbott Nutrition) or a combination supplement given as a bolus, shows that there is no effect on overall all-cause mortality or ventilator- or ICU-free days when compared with generally isonitrogenous and isocaloric control formulas. A sub-group analysis of lower quality research shows that there may be a modest benefit for patients with a higher risk of mortality ( 105250 ). Two more recent meta-analyses have yielded similar results ( 105248 , 105249 ). Most studies included in these analyses investigated the use of Oxepa and found there was no effect on mortality when compared with control enteral formulas. Studies investigating other sources of enteral or intravenous fish oil were also included in these analyses ( 105248 , 105249 ). In one of these analyses, some overall low- to very low-quality evidence suggests that use of Oxepa modestly reduces mortality at 28 days, as well as ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation ( 105248 ). However, these benefits were not found in the second meta-analysis ( 105249 ). Most studies included in these analyses used fish oil in combination with other ingredients. Therefore, the effect of fish oil alone is unclear. more Age-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral fish oil prevents age-related cognitive decline. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that there is no effect of increased dietary or supplemental omega-3 intake on global cognition in older adults ( 103501 ). The effect of fish oil supplements, specifically, is unclear. more Allergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if taking oral fish oil during pregnancy prevents allergic rhinitis in the child. Preliminary clinical research shows that maternal ingestion of fish oil 4 grams daily, providing 32% EPA and 23% DHA with tocopherol, during late pregnancy might reduce the occurrence of allergic rhinitis in the offspring at 16 years of age when compared with placebo ( 17409 ). However, higher-quality clinical research shows that maternal intake of fish oil supplements containing DHA 800 mg and EPA 100 mg by mouth daily starting at 21 weeks gestation and continuing until delivery, does not affect the development of allergic rhinitis in offspring by the age of 3 or 6 years ( 89361 , 97172 ). more Alzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for preventing Alzheimer disease or for improving cognition in those with this condition. Higher fish and fish oil intake has been linked to a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer disease in population studies ( 15040 , 15041 , 65817 ). However, in patients with existing mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease, taking a specific fish oil supplement (EPAX1050TG, Pronova Biocare A/S) providing the omega-3 fatty acids DHA 1.7 grams and EPA 0.6 grams daily for 6 months does not significantly delay cognitive decline, although this fish oil supplement might slow cognitive decline in a subgroup of patients with very mild cognitive dysfunction ( 15024 ). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking fish oil 1 gram (providing docosahexaenoic acid 500 mg and eicosapentaenoic acid 150 mg), lutein 10 mg, zeaxanthin 2 mg, meso-zeaxanthin 10 mg, and vitamin E 15 mg (Memory Health) daily for 12 months does not affect disease severity when compared with placebo. However, there were modest increases the number of patients experiencing either an improvement or an attenuated decline in memory and mood ( 109764 ). The effect of fish oil alone is unclear from this study. more Antiphospholipid syndrome-associated miscarriage. It is unclear if oral fish oil prevents miscarriage in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil 5.1 grams standardized to a 1.5 ratio of EPA:DHA, daily for 3 years seems to prevent recurrent miscarriage and increase live birth rate in pregnant patients with antiphospholipid syndrome ( 1032 ). more Antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for metabolic side effects related to the use of olanzapine. In patients with both schizophrenia and metabolic syndrome using olanzapine, clinical research shows that taking fish oil (Nature Made) providing EPA 720 mg and DHA 480 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces triglyceride levels by about 27% when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on blood pressure or levels of fasting glucose or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ( 105225 ). In patients taking olanzapine with sodium valproate or lithium, a small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil (Zahravi Pharmaceutical Company), starting at a dose of 300 mg EPA plus DHA to 600 mg daily in two divided doses and titrating up to 900 mg daily in three divided doses for a total of 6 weeks, does not improve anthropometric measures or lipid parameters when compared with placebo ( 105226 ). These differing findings may be due to differences in fish oil dose and duration. more Asthma. It is unclear if oral fish oil prevents or treats asthma. Some research suggests that fish oil supplements may help TREAT asthma symptoms in some patients, but results are conflicting. Some clinical research shows that taking a fish oil supplement improves peak flow and reduces medication use and cough in children with asthma ( 12954 , 12963 ). Fish oil providing EPA 17-26.8 mg/kg and DHA 7.3-11.5 mg/kg has been used in one study ( 12954 ). However, other clinical research shows that taking fish oil does not improve asthma severity in children with bronchial asthma when compared to control, although asthma severity seems to be reduced when compared to baseline ( 65497 ). In adults, fish oil does not seem to improve measures of asthma such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), peak flow rate, asthma symptoms, asthma medication use, or bronchial hyper-reactivity ( 12954 , 17411 , 66266 , 1036 , 20546 , 66206 ). However, in asthmatic patients experiencing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, fish oil (EPAX 3000 TG; Pronova Biocare), 20 capsules totaling 3.2 grams of EPA and 2 grams of DHA daily for 3 weeks seems to improve pulmonary function and reduce bronchodilator use when compared with placebo ( 65680 ). There is also conflicting evidence for the use of fish oil in asthma PREVENTION. For example, clinical research shows that maternal ingestion of fish oil supplements 4 grams daily or omega-3 fatty acids 0.65-3.7 grams daily during late-phase pregnancy reduces the occurrence of asthma in infants and children by 31% to 63% when compared with control ( 17409 , 66112 , 96120 ). The benefit seems to be greater for children of mothers with the lowest blood levels of EPA and DHA at baseline ( 96120 ). Conversely, other research found no benefit for asthma prevention with fish oil supplementation during lactation ( 66112 ). Also, giving fish oil containing DHA 280 mg plus EPA 110 mg daily to children during the first 6 months of life does not appear to prevent asthma development by the age of 6-12 months ( 89338 ). However, in a meta-analysis of 10 trials with follow-up of 6 months to 24 years, maternal intake of fish oil supplements at a dose of at least 1200 mg daily during pregnancy, lactation, or both, reduces the risk of asthma in the infant, but does not affect the rate of wheezing ( 108506 ). more Athletic performance. It is unclear if oral fish oil improves athletic performance. Evidence on the effect of fish oil in athletic performance is mixed. Some clinical research in athletes participating in intensive wrestling training shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 12 weeks improves pulmonary function when compared with placebo ( 65971 ). In another small clinical study in professional rugby players, taking fish oil containing EPA 551 mg and DHA 551 mg twice daily for 5 weeks during training attenuates the decline in counter movement jump when compared with placebo ( 99357 ). However, taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 5 weeks does not seem to improve endurance or recovery in professional Australian Football League athletes when compared with baseline or placebo ( 65876 ). more Atopic disease. Oral fish oil does not seem to reduce the odds of a child developing atopic disease when taken during pregnancy. One clinical trial shows that taking fish oil capsules providing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 1.9 grams, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 0. 22 grams, and other omega-3 fatty acids 0.28 grams, starting in early pregnancy and continuing until 6 months postpartum, does not reduce the odds of the child developing atopic eczema, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, recurrent wheezing, asthma, or food allergy at 12 or 24 months of age when compared with placebo ( 112465 ). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in children or adults with ADHD. Some, but not all, preliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil or other sources of long chain omega-3 fatty acids orally improves attention, cognitive function, and behavior in children aged 8-13 years with or without an official diagnosis of ADHD ( 8800 , 65868 ). Omega-3 fatty acids 250 mg esterified to phosphatidylserine 300 mg daily for 3 months has been used ( 65868 ). Additional clinical research shows that taking a specific supplement containing fish oil 400 mg and evening primrose oil 100 mg (Eye Q, Novasel), six capsules daily for 15 weeks, improves cognitive function, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and behavior in children aged 7-12 years with ADHD ( 15739 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to fish oil, evening primrose oil, or the combination. However, research is conflicting. A meta-analysis of 22 clinical studies that include some studies mentioned above in children aged 7-12 years old with ADHD shows that taking oral fish oil 51-2513 mg daily with or without stimulants for 4 weeks to 12 months does not improve parent-rated ADHD core symptoms when compared with control. However, subgroup analysis suggests that long-term supplementation with fish oil for 4 months or longer may improve parent-rated ADHD core symptoms when compared with control ( 112468 ). Fish oil has also been evaluated in adults with ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. One clinical study in this population shows that taking fish oil 5.2 grams daily for 4 weeks modestly improves inattention when compared with control ( 108725 ). Despite some positive findings from mainly preliminary clinical research, Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that omega-3 fatty acids in doses of 120 mg to 1200 mg are not currently recommended for adjunctive or monotherapy use in children with ADHD. Furthermore, there is not enough research in adults to make a recommendation ( 110318 ). more Autism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in prevention or treatment of children or adults with autism spectrum disorder. Clinical research in children with autism shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids (Zahravi Company) 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks, providing EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg, modestly reduces overall autism severity and modestly improves stereotyped behavior and social communication when compared with a control group taking medium chain triglycerides. However, there was no benefit on social interaction ( 105218 ). The evidence related to hyperactivity in children with autism is mixed. One small clinical study in children aged 5-17 years shows that taking 1.5 grams of fish oil providing EPA 0.84 grams and DHA 0.7 grams daily for 6 weeks reduces hyperactivity when compared with placebo. However, there was a large between-group difference in baseline hyperactivity ratings, which may have exaggerated the effect size ( 65732 ). Other clinical research in children aged 3-8 years shows that taking fish oil 1.3 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve hyperactivity when compared with placebo ( 66070 ). Fish oil has also been evaluated in adults with autism. One small clinical study shows that taking fish oil 5.2 grams daily for 4 weeks improves neurocognition, including attention and working memory, when compared with placebo. However, it does not affect social interaction ( 108725 ). Other clinical research in adults with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) shows that taking fish oil 5.2 grams daily for 4 weeks modestly improves inattention when compared with control ( 108725 ). Oral fish oil has also been evaluated to determine its impact on the likelihood of autism in children. An observational study shows that self-reported prenatal DIETARY fish intake is associated with a 16% lower odds of autism diagnosis, while SUPPLEMENTAL fish oil is not associated with odds of autism diagnosis ( 115739 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the possibility of residual confounding and the lack of data on type of fish oil supplementation. more Autoimmune thyroiditis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for autoimmune thyroiditis prevention. The effect of oral fish oil on autoimmune thyroiditis prevention has been investigated in a large clinical trial of approximately 25,000 older adults. Taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 5 years providing EPA 0.46 grams and DHA 0.38 grams, alone or in combination with vitamin D3 2000 IU daily, does not reduce the risk of developing definite or probable autoimmune thyroiditis when compared with placebo ( 107184 ). Although this study was large, the primary endpoint was the effect of taking fish oil and/or vitamin D on the development of autoimmune diseases as a group. The number of patients with a specific autoimmune disease such as autoimmune thyroiditis was relatively small. more Bipolar disorder. Oral fish oil may be beneficial for symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar disorder. However, taking fish oil does not seem to prevent mood relapses or improve symptoms of mania in these patients. Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that omega-3 fatty acids in doses standardized to 1-2 grams eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are weakly recommended for adjunctive use in bipolar depression ( 110318 ). This recommendation is based mainly on an early meta-analysis of clinical research of flaxseed oil, EPA alone, or oil containing EPA and DHA ( 66126 ). Also, some preliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil along with conventional therapies may improve symptoms of depression and increase length of remission when compared with placebo. The doses of fish oil used in these studies provided EPA 6.2 grams and DHA 3.4 grams daily for 4 months or EPA 1.7 grams and DHA 0.9 grams daily for 6 months ( 7202 , 113218 ). However, a more recent small clinical trial shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA 1 gram plus DHA 1 gram daily for 52 weeks, in a 200 mL smoothie (Nutrifriend, Smartfish) also providing vitamin D 35 micrograms and vitamin E 1.89 mg does not reduce the number of mood episode relapses, increase the time to first mood episode relapse, or improve measures of depression when compared with placebo ( 105216 ). Omega-3 fatty acids have not been shown to be effective in attenuating mania or hypomania. Most research shows that fish oil doesn't seem to have beneficial effects on manic symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder ( 5713 , 7202 , 66126 , 105216 , 110318 ). Also, theoretically, fish oil might increase symptoms of mania in patients with bipolar disorder. Cases of hypomania have been reported in patients with bipolar disorder using fish oil ( 5713 , 7202 ). more Borderline personality disorder. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for borderline personality disorder. A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with borderline personality disorder shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids modestly reduces overall symptom severity, especially impulsive behavior, when compared with control. However, one of the studies included in the analysis used eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) alone and another was limited by the lack of a placebo group ( 106065 ). more Burns. Oral fish oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in hospitalized adults with 20-45% surface area 2 nd or 3 rd degree burns shows that consuming a beverage containing fish oil 3 grams and collagen peptides 40 grams daily for 4 weeks shortens the time to wound healing and improves scar scores but does not limit wound infections when compared with placebo ( 110667 ). more Cancer. It is unclear if dietary or supplemental fish oil can reduce the risk for cancer; the available research is conflicting. There is conflicting evidence about the role of fish oil in cancer prevention. Many epidemiological studies have found that increased intake of supplemental or dietary fish oil, as well as higher blood levels or dietary intakes of omega-3 fatty acids, are associated with a decreased risk of several cancers including oral, pharyngeal, esophageal, pancreatic, colon, rectal, lung, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers ( 6395 , 7378 , 9773 , 9774 , 10153 , 12958 , 12959 , 12960 , 12961 , 12962 , 15736 , 17412 )( 25937 , 101536 , 103494 , 107175 ). Also, a meta-analysis of epidemiological research has found that the highest fish or fish oil intake is associated with a 13% or 19% reduced incidence of mortality in patients with cancer when compared to the lowest intake ( 107183 ). However, most meta-analyses of epidemiological research have identified no benefit ( 14264 , 66078 , 66092 , 103494 ) and a large clinical trial shows that fish oil does not reduce the risk of invasive cancers ( 99362 ). Also, one large epidemiological study has found that dietary intake of fish oil from fatty fish twice a week or more was associated with a 16% increased risk of breast cancer when compared with eating fatty fish less than twice weekly ( 107175 ). In addition, a meta-analysis of results from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial suggests that higher blood percentages of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are associated with a 2.5-fold higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer, but not low-grade prostate cancer, when compared with lower blood percentages of DHA ( 25936 ). more Canker sores. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for preventing or treating canker sores. In patients with chronic canker sores presenting with 1-3 ulcers at baseline, preliminary clinical research shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids (Zahravi Company) 1000 mg daily, providing EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg, for 6 months reduces the size, number, duration, pain, and overall severity of ulcers by 32% to 63%. These changes were significant when compared with placebo. In addition, the ulcer-free period was increased by approximately 45% ( 105219 ). more Cardiovascular disease (CVD). The effect of fish oil on cardiovascular health is controversial. Oral fish oil in doses of up to 4 grams daily does not seem to be beneficial for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. It is unclear whether dietary fish oil or a higher daily dose is beneficial for prevention of CVD. In 2018, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommended that healthy individuals consume 1-2 servings of non-fried fish weekly in place of less healthy sources of protein and fat for primary prevention of CVD. This recommendation was based mainly on evidence from prospective cohort studies showing a modestly lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) with higher seafood intake or dietary intake of fish oil ( 97185 ). Some population research has also found that increased consumption of dietary fish oil is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, sudden death, and myocardial infarction in people without CVD ( 2309 , 8676 , 10006 , 12915 , 12917 , 12977 , 65723 , 94231 ). However, a large cohort study from the United Kingdom has found that increased consumption of dietary fish oil is associated with an INCREASED risk of atrial fibrillation and stroke in people without CVD compared with non-use of fish oil ( 114182 ). Also, clinical research generally shows that taking fish oil has little benefit for the primary prevention of CVD. A large meta-analysis of moderate to high quality clinical research published in 2018 shows that higher intake of fish oil as part of the diet or from supplements has little to no benefit for primary prevention of CVD, including all-cause mortality, CVD or CHD mortality, CVD or CHD events, stroke, or arrhythmias ( 98231 ). An additional meta-analysis published in 2020 shows that although fish oil supplementation had a very small protective effect overall against CVD death, there was no benefit on all-cause mortality or on primary prevention of CVD death ( 104547 ). Reasons for these conflicting results may relate to the fact that most of the primary prevention studies included in these meta-analyses evaluated fish oil supplements rather than dietary fish oil. Only two studies included in one of the meta-analyses assessed the effects of dietary fish oil, while up to 33 studies assessed the effects of fish oil supplements ( 98231 , 104547 ). Some newer, large, high-quality clinical studies have also found no benefit with fish oil supplements for this purpose. One high-quality study shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily for about 5.3 years is not beneficial for primary prevention of CVD ( 99362 ). Another large study including 15,480 patients with diabetes and no evidence of CVD at baseline shows that taking fish oil supplements 1 gram daily does not reduce the risk of serious vascular events, such as nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, transient ischemic attack, or vascular death, when compared with placebo over a 7.4-year follow-up period ( 98232 ). Also, in patients at high cardiovascular risk, taking a prescription-only fish oil product (Epanova, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals) 4 grams daily for up to 5 years does not prevent major adverse cardiovascular events, such as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina, when compared with a corn oil placebo ( 103491 ). Based on the cumulative evidence, fish oil SUPPLEMENTS do not appear to be beneficial for primary prevention of CVD. DIETARY fish oil may reduce the risk of CVD, but results are conflicting and any benefit is probably modest at best. Research has also evaluated fish oil for prevention of cardiovascular events in people with existing CVD (secondary prevention). An analysis of two secondary prevention trials shows that consuming fatty fish 2-3 times weekly reduces the risk of overall mortality by 30%, but does not reduce the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction ( 7359 , 8673 ). Population research in patients with existing CVD suggests that intake of fish oil supplements is associated with a reduced risk of some cardiovascular events when compared with non-use of fish oil supplements ( 114182 ). One population study in patients with at least two cardiometabolic diseases suggests that use of fish oil supplements is associated with a 19% lower risk of CVD-related mortality over 12 years, and a 17% lower risk of overall mortality, when compared with not using fish oil supplements. The additional life expectancy range of 1.4 to 2.3 years was dependent on age and the severity of cardiometabolic morbidity ( 110333 ). Another large population study suggests that regular use of fish oil supplements is associated with a small reduction in transitions from atrial fibrillation to major adverse cardiovascular events or myocardial infarction, and from heart failure to death ( 114182 ). However, in clinical research, the effect of fish oil supplements for secondary prevention of CVD is controversial and contradictory. Most older research shows that taking fish oil supplements provides benefit; however, these studies are at high risk for bias ( 1007 , 2307 , 8673 , 12916 , 12917 , 13750 , 65723 , 66495 ). Additionally, newer research shows that supplemental fish oil does not help with secondary prevention of CVD. A large meta-analysis of moderate to high quality clinical research published in 2018 also shows that higher intake of fish oil, mainly as supplements, has little to no benefit for secondary prevention of CVD, including all-cause mortality, CVD or CHD mortality, CVD or CHD events, stroke, or arrhythmias ( 98231 ). In addition, a meta-analysis published in 2020 shows that although fish oil supplementation had a very small protective effect overall against CVD death, there was no benefit on all-cause mortality or on the secondary prevention of CVD death ( 104547 ). A large clinical trial shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 5 years does not significantly reduce cardiovascular events when compared with an olive oil control in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors or atherosclerosis ( 93576 ). In patients with a recent myocardial infarction, a smaller clinical trial shows that taking fish oil (Lovaza, formerly known as Omacor, GlaxoSmithKline) 4 grams daily for 6 months does not reduce the risk of a major adverse cardiovascular event over about 6 years, including death, heart failure hospitalization, recurrent acute coronary syndrome, or late coronary artery bypass graft, when compared with placebo. However, there was a statistically significant reduction in having at least one major adverse cardiovascular event in patients with at least a 5% increase in blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids ( 113220 ). Multiple other meta-analyses published from 2012 to 2018 also show no benefit of fish oil supplements for cardiovascular risk in patients with existing CVD ( 17990 , 94231 , 96116 ). Some meta-analyses have combined all studies related to both primary and secondary prevention. A meta-analysis published in 2021 shows that fish oil supplementation reduces the risk of CVD death by 7%, non-fatal myocardial infarction by 13%, CHD events by 9%, and major adverse cardiovascular events by 5%, with no benefit on all-cause mortality or stroke. This analysis also showed that use of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) alone, as investigated in only four of the 38 trials, offered the largest protective effect ( 107181 ). Another meta-analysis of a small group of randomized trials analyzing the effectiveness of fish oil for protection against CHD in patients with and without CHD at baseline shows that taking fish oil reduces CHD by 16%. However, there was no effect on angina, sepsis, or death ( 107185 ). This analysis is limited by the small number and suboptimal quality of studies, as well as the age of the publications. Since these analyses combine patients with and without CVD at baseline, it is difficult to draw any conclusions related to primary CVD outcomes. There has been speculation that patients in more recent studies were more likely to be receiving protective effects from treatment with statins and other drugs, which could reduce the potential benefit of fish oil ( 17990 , 17991 ). However, two meta-analyses of clinical data shows that fish oil does not reduce the risk of major vascular events, regardless of prior or concomitant statin use ( 96116 , 98231 ). Interestingly, in 2017 the AHA published a science advisory stating that it is reasonable to supplement with fish oil 1 gram daily for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular disease. The AHA concluded that the cumulative evidence generally supports that fish oil supplementation reduces cardiovascular death, though not nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction, and the benefit of using fish oil for secondary prevention outweighs the treatment risk. However, the AHA noted that most evidence of benefit is based on research published before 2002 ( 93568 ). Furthermore, the AHA recommendation was released prior to the publication of the most recent clinical trials and meta-analyses showing no benefit of fish oil for secondary prevention of CVD. Many other guidelines including that of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, the European Society of Cardiology, and European Atherosclerosis Society state that fish oil supplements are not significantly beneficial for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events ( 96116 , 97477 ). Overall, best evidence to date show that fish oil SUPPLEMENTS, typically taken in doses of 1 gram daily, are not beneficial for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. Additionally, prescription fish oil products in higher doses of 4 grams daily do not seem to be beneficial for primary prevention of CVD. DIETARY fish oil might be beneficial for primary or secondary prevention, but benefits are probably modest at best. Still, people should continue to eat fish and other foods that provide omega-3 fatty acids, as these foods make up part of a healthy diet. In fact, in 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that foods containing EPA and DHA may reduce the risk of CHD. However, the FDA has determined that this claim is based on supportive, rather than conclusive, evidence ( 102370 ). more Cataracts. It is unclear if oral fish oil prevents the development of cataracts. Epidemiological research has found that eating fish three times weekly is associated with a modestly reduced risk of developing cataracts in females. Eating fish three times weekly rather than once monthly is associated with an 11% reduction in developing cataracts ( 12955 ). more Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for the prevention of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving chemotherapy. A meta-analysis of three clinical trials with unclear or high risk of bias in patients with breast, colon, lung, or ovarian cancer shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids for 3-6 months reduces the odds of developing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy by approximately 80% when compared with placebo ( 106070 ). more Chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral or dietary fish oil is beneficial in patients with CKD or for CKD prevention. A meta-analysis of the available clinical research in adults with CKD who are receiving hemodialysis shows that taking fish oil supplements might reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality. However, this finding is based on low to very-low quality evidence, and there was no difference identified for risk of all-cause mortality. Additionally, adults with CKD who are not receiving hemodialysis do not seem to benefit from fish oil supplementation ( 102395 ). Observational research in adults with CKD has found that dietary omega-3 fatty acid intake of 1.93-9.65 grams daily is associated with a 33% reduced risk of mortality when compared with intakes of less than 0.86 gram daily. However, the amount of omega-3 intake from fish oil, specifically, is unknown ( 107173 ). Observational research has also been conducted to examine the association between habitual fish oil supplementation and developing CKD. A large observational study in individuals without prior CKD has found that taking fish oil supplements is associated with a 10% reduced incidence of CKD over the next 10 years when compared with not taking fish oil supplements ( 110330 ). more Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with COPD or for COPD prevention. A small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil (Omax3, Cenestra Health) 3 grams daily for 6 months does not improve pulmonary function, respiratory symptoms, or endothelial function when compared with placebo in patients with COPD. However, it increased the number of people experiencing improvements in health-related quality of life ( 104546 ). Another small clinical trial in patients with COPD shows that taking a specific medical nutrition product (Nutrifriend Cachexia; Smartfish) providing omega-3 fatty acids 2 grams, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 10 mcg, and whey protein 10 grams twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve lung function when compared with an isocaloric placebo based on milk protein and sunflower oil. However, there was a modest increase in fat mass, as well as modest reductions in triglyceride levels, systolic blood pressure, and exercise-induced fatigue and dyspnea in those taking the omega-3 fatty acid combination product ( 107189 ). Observational research has also been conducted to examine the association between habitual fish oil supplementation and developing COPD. A large observational study in individuals without prior COPD has found that taking fish oil supplements is associated with a 12% reduced incidence of COPD over the next 9 years when compared with not taking fish oil supplements ( 110331 ). more Cirrhosis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with cirrhosis. Preliminary clinical research in adults with advanced cirrhosis shows that taking fish oil orally does not seem to improve the severity of renal impairment associated with cirrhosis ( 1013 ). more Cognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral fish oil prevents or treats cognitive impairment. Some clinical research suggests that taking 3 fish oil capsules (EPAX 1050TG; EPAX AS) by mouth daily for 12 months may improve memory in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Each capsule contained 1 gram of fish oil, comprised of DHA 430 mg and EPA 150 mg ( 89346 ). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that increased dietary or supplemental omega-3 intake has no preventive effect on cognitive impairment in older adults ( 103501 ). The effect of fish oil is unclear. Fish oil has also been evaluated as part of combination therapy. A large clinical study in adults at least 55 years of age with cognitive impairment shows that taking fish oil, containing DHA 1.1 grams and EPA 0.4 grams, and dark chocolate containing 500 mg cocoa flavanols daily for 12 months does not improve cognitive function scores when compared with placebo ( 111453 ). more Colorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral fish oil prevents or treats colorectal cancer. Fish oil has been evaluated for the PREVENTION of colorectal cancer. A large, high-quality clinical study shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily for a median of 5.3 years does not reduce the risk for colorectal cancer precursors, including colorectal adenomas and serrated polyps, when compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses suggest that patients with low omega-3 fatty acid levels at baseline or those with African American heritage might have a reduced risk for colorectal cancer precursors; however, further research is needed to confirm these findings ( 102400 ). Fish oil has also been evaluated for the TREATMENT of colorectal cancer. One small clinical trial shows that taking a specific fish oil supplement (Omega-3, Phytomare) 2 grams daily containing 360 mg of EPA and 240 mg of DHA for 9 weeks along with chemotherapy prolongs the time to tumor progression when compared with not receiving a fish oil supplement. However, it does not reduce the number of patients with tumor progression, hospitalizations, deaths, or chemotherapy requirements ( 91249 ). Observational research has found that increased dietary or supplemental fish oil intake is not associated with increased survival in stage three colon cancer patients overall. However, it is associated with increased survival in patients with wild-type KRAS tumors ( 101274 ). Further research is needed to confirm whether specific patient populations might benefit from fish oil supplementation. more Contrast induced nephropathy. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for preventing contrast induced nephropathy. Preliminary clinical research in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing coronary angiography shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids (Omacor, Abbott Laboratories) 4 grams twice daily on the day before and the day of angiography does not reduce the number of patients with an increase in serum creatinine levels of at least 0.5 mg/dL within 48 hours, or the need for renal replacement therapy, when compared with taking N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg ( 107193 ). more Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial following CABG surgery. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking supplemental fish oil 4 grams orally, containing EPA 2.04 grams and DHA 1.3 grams, beginning on the first postoperative day and continuing for one year thereafter, seems to decrease the incidence of CABG occlusion following surgery when compared with control ( 2314 ). more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for reducing symptoms in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. A small preliminary clinical trial in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 2 grams daily for 2 weeks modestly reduces body pain and fatigue and improves appetite when compared with patients not taking omega-3 fatty acids. However, there were no significant differences in olfactory symptoms between groups. All patients were also taking hydroxychloroquine 800 mg daily ( 107188 ). more Crohn disease. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for reducing the risk of Crohn disease or the risk for relapse in patients with Crohn disease who are in remission; the available evidence is conflicting. Population research has found that habitual intake of fish oil supplements is not associated with a decreased risk of Crohn disease ( 109303 ). However, taking fish oil might reduce the risk of relapse in patients with Crohn disease. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific enteric coated fish oil supplement (Purepa, Tillotts Pharma) providing 2.7 grams omega-3 fatty acids daily for 12 months can reduce the relapse rate for patients who are in remission ( 6257 ). However, other clinical trials show that taking fish oil 4-5 grams daily does not significantly reduce relapse when compared with placebo ( 6259 , 16734 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that treatment with enteric-coated, time-released omega-3 fatty acid or fish oil capsules containing EPA 1.2-3.3 grams and DHA 0.6-1.8 grams daily for up to one year reduces the relapse rate by 13% when compared to control ( 66061 , 89347 ). However, this risk reduction was not observed when only high-quality studies were considered. Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids for 12-24 months does not reduce relapse rate when compared with control ( 105224 ). more Cyclosporine-induced hypertension. Small clinical studies suggest that oral fish oil may prevent or modestly improve symptoms in patients with cyclosporine-induced hypertension. Taking fish oil 3 grams daily for 3 months orally seems to prevent cyclosporine-induced hypertension following cardiac transplant ( 66367 ). There is also some evidence that fish oil 4 grams daily for 6 months can maintain pre-cyclosporine blood pressure in patients taking cyclosporine ( 1012 ). A meta-analysis of two small clinical studies shows that fish oil 2-18 grams containing 0.6-5.4 grams of EPA and DHA daily for 1-12 months reduces diastolic blood pressure by 4.5 mmHg in kidney transplant recipients using calcineurin inhibitors, including cyclosporine, when compared with placebo ( 65770 ). more Cystic fibrosis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with cystic fibrosis. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids (EPA plus DHA) as 1.3% of total caloric intake for up to 8 months improves pulmonary function based on forced expiratory volume and reduces the number of days during which antibiotics are needed when compared to baseline ( 65553 ). more Dementia. It is unclear if oral fish oil, as supplements or in the diet, reduces the risk of dementia; the available research is conflicting. Some epidemiological research suggests that eating fish at least once weekly or the regular use of fish oil supplements is associated with a 7% to 57% reduced risk of developing dementia in older adults and elderly individuals ( 65595 , 108507 , 108724 , 109307 , 111452 ); however, other research has found no correlation between overall dementia risk and the consumption of fish or fish oil ( 65962 , 103501 ). Some epidemiological research has examined the association between the regular use of fish oil supplements and the risk of individual types of dementia in large prospective studies. These studies suggest that regular use of fish oil supplements is not associated with the risk of Alzheimer disease ( 108507 , 108724 , 109307 ). Also, a study in over 215,000 older adults suggests that regular use of fish oil supplements is not associated with the risk of vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia ( 108507 ). However, other studies suggest that regular use of fish oil supplements may be associated with 15% and 57% lower risks of vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia, respectively ( 108724 , 109307 ). The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear. One large epidemiological study suggests that associations between the regular use of fish oil supplements and the risks of all-cause or vascular dementia are stronger in males ( 109307 ). Some research suggests that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype may alter the association between fish oil intake and dementia risk ( 65817 , 108507 , 108724 ), however, other research disagrees ( 111452 ). One large epidemiological study suggests that regular use of fish oil supplements is associated with a 15% lower risk of vascular dementia. However, this study suggests that the risk of vascular dementia is INCREASED by 86% in individuals with two APOE-e4 alleles, whereas the risk is reduced by 19% in those with one APOE-e4 allele and by 22% in those with no APOE-e4 alleles ( 108724 ). Further research is needed to confirm the clinical relevance of this potential interaction. more Depression. It is unclear if oral or dietary fish oil is beneficial for the prevention of depression or in patients with depressive symptoms. There is some evidence that benefits vary depending on the form of fish oil used and the patient population studied. Observational research has found that higher dietary intake of fish has been associated with a lower risk of depression and suicide ( 10867 , 10868 , 99368 ). Also, low omega-3 fatty acid levels in plasma and red blood cells have been associated with depression ( 10859 , 10860 ). However, clinical research does not show that taking fish oil is beneficial for the prevention of depression. A large clinical trial in adults 50 years or older without depression shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily, providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 465 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 375 mg, for a median of 5.3 years results in a small increased risk of depression or symptoms of depression when compared with placebo ( 107196 ). Also, one small clinical study in healthy female nurses shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids containing EPA 1200 mg and DHA 600 mg daily for 90 days does not affect measures or depression or prevent a major depressive episode when compared with placebo ( 105220 ). It is also unclear whether oral fish oil is beneficial for reducing symptoms of depression. Results from meta-analyses have been mixed ( 48282 , 66129 , 99356 , 102391 , 104551 , 107191 , 112032 ). However, populations included in these analyses have included older adults with or without clinical depression ( 99356 , 112032 ), mixed populations ( 48282 , 66129 , 102391 ), patients with perinatal depression ( 104551 ), patients with mild depression ( 48282 ), or patients with major or unipolar depression ( 107191 ). Despite the mixed findings overall, most research suggests that taking fish oil may have a small beneficial effect in patients with clinical depression. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with clinical depression shows that fish oil supplementation has a small to modest beneficial effect on symptoms when compared with placebo ( 107191 ). However, it is unknown if these benefits are clinically meaningful since most studies are small and generally low-quality. Also, this analysis combined studies investigating fish oil with studies investigating EPA or DHA alone ( 107191 ). Small clinical studies in children and adults with clinical depression support the potential for beneficial effects of fish oil ( 10871 , 65712 , 65869 ). Also, clinical research in postmenopausal females with moderate to severe psychiatric distress shows that fish oil reduces depressive symptoms when compared with placebo ( 65925 ). However, a small clinical study in Japanese workers with mild to moderate depression shows that taking fish oil containing DHA 500 mg and EPA 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks in addition to a psychological intervention is no different than the psychological intervention alone ( 100251 ). Also, a large clinical trial in patients with depression and coronary heart disease shows that adding fish oil 2 grams daily for 10 weeks, providing 930 mg of EPA and 750 mg of DHA, to sertraline 50 mg daily does not improve depression when compared with sertraline and placebo ( 17408 ). Additionally, clinical research in patients with a history of ischemic stroke shows that taking fish oil 3 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve depression or other mood-related parameters when compared with placebo ( 65996 ). An analysis of a cohort of older adults with subthreshold depression or high-risk factors for depression from the VITAL-DEP trial shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily for 2 years does not reduce the risk of major depressive disorder or improve mood scores when compared with placebo ( 112032 ). Most research in patients with perinatal depression has found no benefit. One small study using fish oil capsules 6 grams daily in divided doses for 6 weeks showed positive outcomes ( 48198 ). However, a meta-analysis and individual clinical studies show that taking EPA plus DHA does not help to prevent or improve depression in these patients, and, when used along with supportive psychotherapy, is no more effective than therapy alone ( 65830 , 89353 , 104551 ). Taking fish oil 1.9 grams daily or omega-3 fatty acids containing EPA 900-1060 mg and DHA 180-274 mg daily for 6-8 weeks does not improve depression when compared with control ( 65830 , 89353 ). The best dose of fish oil for reduction of depression symptoms is unknown. Doses of omega-3 fatty acids used in clinical trials in adults have included fish oil supplements providing EPA, usually 0.6-4 grams daily, alone or with DHA 0.15-2.4 grams daily for 4-16 weeks. In one study, a specific fish oil product (Isodisnatura) 1.5 grams, containing 1.05 grams ethyl-EPA and 0.15 grams ethyl-DHA, daily for 8 weeks was used. In children 6-12 years of age, fish oil 1 gram daily for 16 weeks has been used ( 10871 , 65712 , 65869 , 65925 , 107191 ). However, meta-analyses of research related to symptoms of depression in mixed populations suggest that fish oil supplements containing only EPA or at least 60% EPA are effective, whereas other fish oil supplements are not ( 48282 , 66129 , 102391 ). Also, although one subgroup analysis of 9 clinical trials found that taking at least 1.5 grams of fish oil daily reduces depressive symptoms ( 99356 ), another meta-analysis found that only fish oil formulations containing no more than 1 gram of EPA demonstrated benefit ( 102391 ). Based on these and other findings, Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that omega-3 fatty acids providing 1-2 grams EPA are recommended for adjunctive use in patients with major depressive disorder. However, omega-3 fatty acids are not recommended as monotherapy and products containing other doses of EPA are not recommended as adjunctive or monotherapy in these patients ( 110318 ). Fish oil is also of interest for improving cognitive function in patients with depression. In patients newly diagnosed with depression, clinical research shows that taking fish oil 8 grams daily for 12 weeks in addition to venlafaxine modestly improves immediate memory, but not other measures of cognitive function, when compared with placebo and venlafaxine. Daily intakes of EPA and DHA were 1440 mg and 960 mg, respectively ( 113219 ). more Developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Oral fish oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Taking a combination of fish oil (80%) and evening primrose oil (20%) for 3 months seems to improve reading, spelling, and behavior when given to children aged 5-12 years with DCD. The combination contains EPA 558 mg, DHA 174 mg, gamma-linolenic acid 60 mg, and vitamin E 9.6 mg daily ( 13748 ). One study shows that taking fish oil with evening primrose oil does not improve motor skills in children with DCD ( 13748 ). However, another very small study shows that taking fish oil in combination with evening primrose oil, thyme oil, and vitamin E (Efalex, Efamol Ltd), for 4 months improves motor skills including manual dexterity, ball skills, and balance in children with dyslexia and DCD ( 5708 ). The effect of fish oil when used alone is unclear. more Diabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Fish oil has been evaluated for the management of diabetic nephropathy in patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. One small clinical study in patients with diabetic nephropathy related to type 1 diabetes shows that taking fish oil 4.6 grams daily for one year does not improve albuminuria or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) when compared with placebo ( 66427 ). In patients with type 2 diabetes, the evidence is mixed. In one study of patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), clinical research shows that taking fish oil (Lovaza) providing EPA 1.86 grams and DHA 1.5 grams daily for one year attenuates the progression of albuminuria, but has no effect on the estimated GFR. In patients not taking ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, there was no effect on albuminuria. The patients in this study had not all been diagnosed with nephropathy ( 101537 ). In another study of patients with diabetic nephropathy taking ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, taking fish oil (Omacor) 3 grams daily for 12 weeks had no effect on proteinuria when compared with control ( 101538 ). more Diabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of neuropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes. Preliminary clinical research in patients with type 1 diabetes shows that taking fish oil 1800 mg daily for 6 months does not prevent the development of new onset diabetic neuropathy or reduce the severity of neuropathy in patients with existing signs of disease when compared with placebo ( 106072 ). However, 86% of patients did not have neuropathy at baseline. more Diabetic retinopathy. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Population research in adults with type 2 diabetes has found that consuming at least 500 mg of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish and seafood daily as part of a Mediterranean diet is associated with a 48% reduced risk of developing sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy when compared with consuming lower amounts ( 96115 ). In contrast, preliminary clinical research in patients with type 1 diabetes shows that taking fish oil 1800 mg daily for 6 months does not affect the severity of retinopathy when compared with placebo ( 106072 ). However, most patients did not have retinopathy at baseline and the study was designed to examine diabetic retinopathy severity as a safety assessment, not as a primary or secondary efficacy endpoint. more Dry eye. Oral fish oil does not seem to reduce the risk of developing dry eye. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with existing dry eye. While some preliminary observational research has found that higher dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids, primarily from seafood sources, is associated with a reduced risk of dry eye syndrome in females ( 13770 ), a large ancillary analysis of the VITAL study, which included over 23,500 adults aged 50 years and older, shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily is not associated with reduced incidence of dry eye disease over a median follow-up of 5.3 years when compared with placebo ( 108510 ). There is also interest in the use of fish oil supplements for the treatment of dry eye. The American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines published in 2013 state that omega-3 fatty acids such as fish oil have been reported to be beneficial for dry eye, but the evidence is insufficient to establish effectiveness ( 95702 ). Several studies in patients with mild to moderate dry eye suggest that taking fish oil supplements providing EPA 360-1680 mg plus DHA 240-560 mg orally daily for 30 days to 12 weeks reduces tear osmolarity, increases tear film stability, and improves some symptoms of dry eye such as pain, blurred vision, and sensitivity, when compared with placebo ( 89342 , 91861 , 93251 , 96114 , 101544 ). Specific commercial fish oil products (Nippon Suisan Kaisha, Ltd; Caruso's Natural Health UltraMAX fish oil; PRN Dry Eye Omega Benefits softgels, PRN Physician Recommended Nutraceuticals) have been used ( 89342 , 91861 , 96114 ). However, many of these studies are small, and some used highly restrictive eligibility criteria, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Furthermore, some of these studies show that taking fish oil does not improve volume of tears produced, damage to the eye, or Meibomian gland dysfunction, which is a leading cause of dry eye ( 91861 , 93251 ). A larger study in over 500 patients shows that taking fish oil providing EPA 2000 mg plus DHA 1000 mg orally daily for 12 months does not improve symptoms of dry eye when compared with placebo in patients with moderate to severe dry eye ( 95701 ). However, the validity of these results is reduced by the use of other medications during the course of the study. Preliminary research investigating fish oil in combination with other ingredients also shows conflicting results ( 17523 , 91860 ). One of these studies used a specific combination product (TheraTears Nutrition, Advanced Nutrition Research) providing EPA 450 mg, DHA 300 mg, and flaxseed oil 1000 mg daily for 90 days ( 17523 ). more Dyslexia. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with dyslexia. In a small clinical trial, taking fish oil containing DHA acid 480 mg daily for one month orally seems to improve night vision in children aged 5 to 12 years with dyslexia. Dyslexic children who take fish oil seem to develop significantly better darkness adaptation ( 5708 ). more Dyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with dyslipidemia. There is contradictory evidence about the effects of fish oil on lipid levels. Consuming about 250 grams of fish in the DIET twice weekly for 8 weeks has been shown to lower total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, as well as increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, in patients with hyperlipidemia ( 97186 ). However, most research shows that taking fish oil SUPPLEMENTS does not improve cholesterol levels and might even increase LDL cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia or dyslipidemia ( 2318 , 8714 , 12182 , 66196 , 97186 , 99358 ). Oftentimes, increases in LDL cholesterol levels occur when fish oil supplements are taken in higher doses such as 5-20 grams daily; however, doses of fish oil supplements containing as little as 2 grams of omega-3 fatty acids daily have been shown to increase LDL cholesterol levels in patients with hyperlipidemia ( 2318 , 12182 , 65729 , 66224 , 66267 , 66257 , 97186 ). Despite its unfavorable effects on LDL cholesterol, fish oil supplements might still be beneficial for patients with dyslipidemia and diabetes. Some clinical research shows that taking fish oil supplements can decrease elevated triglyceride levels, decrease secretion of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), increase VLDL apolipoprotein B secretion, and increase levels of HDL cholesterol in people with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia ( 8714 , 8807 , 12182 ). Fish oil 4 grams daily for up to 8 weeks has been used ( 8714 , 8807 ). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that fish oil, 6 grams daily for 3 months taken alone, or fish oil 1 gram daily combined with pravastatin 20 mg, can correct the dyslipidemia associated with renal transplantation ( 8805 , 66454 ). Some research has shown that taking fish oil in combination with garlic and plant sterols reduces lipid levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia or dyslipidemia. However, it is possible that these favorable effects are due to the other ingredients, since garlic and plants sterols have been shown to independently reduce lipid levels ( 2318 , 2319 , 97173 ). more Endometrial cancer. It is unclear if oral fish oil reduces the risk for endometrial cancer. Some epidemiological research has found that consuming approximately two servings of fatty fish weekly is associated with a reduced risk for endometrial cancer. However, other epidemiological research has not found an association between fish consumption and risk of endometrial cancer ( 8690 , 9774 ). It is unclear if taking fish oil supplements reduces the risk of endometrial cancer. more Endometriosis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with endometriosis. Clinical research in females aged 12-25 years who had surgery for endometriosis at least 6 weeks prior shows that taking fish oil (NatureMade) 1 gram daily for 6 months has no clinical effect on pain or analgesic use when compared with placebo ( 101546 ). It is not known whether taking fish oil helps to reduce pain related to endometriosis prior to surgery. more Epilepsy. Some clinical research suggests that oral omega-3 fatty acids may modestly reduce seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy. However, it is unclear if oral fish oil itself is beneficial in patients with epilepsy. Two meta-analyses of several low- to moderate-quality clinical trials in adults and children with epilepsy (drug-resistant and treatment responsive) show that taking omega-3 fatty acids 300-3000 mg daily, usually as fish oil, for 12 weeks to 1 year modestly reduces seizure frequency when compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses show greater benefit with doses less than 2000 mg daily ( 106067 , 116951 ). Although most studies included in the analysis investigated the combined effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), some studies used purified or semi-purified EPA or DHA. Also, some studies included in the analysis were very small in size ( 89337 , 106067 , 116951 ). Clinical research in children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and intractable epilepsy who are also taking risperidone 0.5 mg daily shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily, providing EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg daily for 6 months, decreases monthly seizure frequency to a median of zero, compared with no change in children taking placebo. However, there was no change in seizure severity ( 107172 ). more Exercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral fish oil reduces the severity of exercise-induced muscle soreness. Small clinical studies in untrained healthy adults in the United Kingdom show that taking fish oil orally 1.8-3 grams daily for 4-6 weeks prior to and during physical exercise does not prevent muscle soreness following elbow flexion or knee contractions ( 8524 , 89340 ). Also, a small clinical study in healthy young females shows that taking fish oil (Vital Atman) 3.2 grams at dinner after a resistance exercise protocol and at lunch over the next three days does not prevent muscle soreness when compared with placebo ( 106071 ). Other clinical research in trained males shows that taking fish oil 5 grams, containing EPA 1882 mg and DHA 485 mg, orally daily for 4 weeks does not reduce muscle soreness after eccentric exercises when compared with placebo ( 111451 ). However, other small clinical studies in untrained healthy adults in Japan show that taking fish oil 1.8-2.4 grams (containing about 300-600 mg EPA and 200-260 mg DHA) daily for 1-2 months ameliorates muscle soreness and improves range of motion following knee extensor exercises or eccentric contraction exercises ( 65958 , 98257 , 100252 , 109222 ). Also, a small clinical study in professional rugby players shows that taking fish oil containing EPA 551 mg and DHA 551 mg twice daily for 5 weeks reduces subjective ratings of whole body muscle soreness when compared with placebo ( 99357 ). Another small clinical trial in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking fish oil (PronovaPure 500:200TG, Newtrition, BASF Pharma, Singapore) 4 grams daily for 4 weeks prior to and for 48 hours after a single high-intensity interval training cycling session modestly reduces calf pain, but not pain in the anterior or posterior thigh, compared with placebo ( 114188 ). These differing findings might be due to differences in patient populations due to their geographic location, but higher quality research is needed to confirm. Fish oil has also been evaluated as part of combination therapy. Preliminary clinical research in healthy untrained adults shows that taking a specific fish oil product (Nippon Suisan Kaisha Ltd) containing EPA 4.8 grams and DHA 2.08 grams, and branched-chain amino acid 9.6 grams orally daily for 8 weeks improves muscle soreness scores and range of motion after eccentric exercise when compared with placebo ( 111461 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to fish oil, branched-chain amino acid, or the combination. more Food allergies. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with food allergies. A pooled analysis of clinical research shows that maternal fish oil supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of allergic sensitization to egg by 31%, but not to milk or peanuts ( 97177 ). more Frailty. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for preventing frailty. Preliminary clinical research in community dwelling adults at least 70 years of age shows that taking fish oil 1 gram orally daily for 3 years does not reduce the odds of becoming pre-frail or frail over 36 months when compared with placebo ( 110829 ). more Gingivitis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with gingivitis. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil 1.8 grams three times daily for 8 days does not improve severity of gingivitis on days 14, 28, or 35 when compared with placebo ( 1005 ). more Glaucoma. Although there has been interest in using oral fish oil for glaucoma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fish oil for this condition. Hemodialysis graft dysfunction. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with hemodialysis graft dysfunction. The evidence on the effects of fish oil for preventing thrombosis or maintaining hemodialysis graft patency is conflicting ( 8684 , 65762 , 89348 , 96119 ). However, a meta-analyses of the available clinical research provides moderate evidence that taking fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids 1.6-3.4 grams daily for 3-12 months reduces thrombosis or the need for intervention to restore arteriovenous access by about 19% to 29% when compared with placebo in patients with fistula or grafts due to kidney failure ( 96123 , 98247 ). Fish oil 4 grams daily for one year has been used to prevent thrombosis after graft placement ( 8684 ). more HIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for HIV. Some clinical evidence shows that taking fish oil-containing food bars does not improve CD4 counts in patients with HIV ( 66414 ). Other clinical research shows that enteral supplementation with a fish oil-enriched peptide-based formula improves CD4 count, but not viral load, in patients with HIV when compared with standard formula ( 65525 ). more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for impaired glucose tolerance. Preliminary clinical research shows that fish oil supplements might reduce the risk of conversion from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia and prediabetes, taking a specific fish oil product (ESAPENTR, Pharmacia and Upjohn) 1 capsule by mouth three times daily (for a total of EPA 1530 mg and DHA 1050 mg) for 6 months lowers triglycerides with no deterioration in glucose tolerance over one year ( 7368 ). Although fish oil may prevent worsening of glycemic parameters, it does not seem to improve them. A small clinical trial shows that taking a specific fish oil supplement (EPAX AS) 6 grams containing 3.9 grams of omega-3 fatty acids does not improve glycemic outcomes when compared with placebo in patients with impaired glucose regulation ( 98242 ). more Infant development. It is unclear if oral fish oil, taken during pregnancy or by the infant, is beneficial for improving vision or cognitive development in infants. Population research suggests that increased consumption of seafood during pregnancy is associated with improved measures of infant and child development such as verbal intelligence, communication, and social development ( 15743 ). In contrast, supplementation with fish oil during pregnancy and/or lactation does not seem to be beneficial or may only be beneficial in male offspring. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy and/or lactation, mainly from fish oil, does not improve cognitive outcomes in the infant up to approximately 2 years of age when compared with control ( 103495 , 105213 ). This is supported from the findings of most individual clinical trials providing fish oil supplements 1-4 grams daily from 20-21 weeks gestation until delivery or until 30 days after childbirth, or providing fish oil supplements or dietary fish during lactation ( 15162 , 48105 , 97182 , 99364 , 113217 ). An additional small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil 2000 mg daily, providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 260 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 1440 mg, from 22-24 weeks gestation until delivery, does not improve most measures of developmental or behavioral milestones in the infant at 6 months, when compared with olive oil placebo ( 110354 ). A large clinical trial shows that ingestion of fish oil (Incromega TG3322, Croda) 4 grams daily during late-phase pregnancy, providing 1.3 grams EPA and 0.9 grams DHA, results in a 17- to 21-day earlier achievement of some, but not all, late motor milestones in male infants. However, there was no improvement in earlier motor milestones. This study also identified modest improvements in male infants for early, but not late, word production, cognitive development at 2.5 years, and behavior and emotion at 6 years ( 105213 ). Providing fish oil supplementation directly to infants may improve the development of vision, but not cognition. Clinical research shows that infants supplemented with fish oil-containing formula beginning within 3-10 days of birth have improved visual acuity at 2 months and improved oscillatory potentials, which are thought to reflect retinal function, at 1 year when compared to infants supplemented with linolenic acid-containing formula ( 66399 , 66569 ). However, supplementing infants with omega-3 fatty acids such as fish oil does not affect cognition and neurodevelopment ( 89349 , 89363 ). more Insomnia. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for insomnia. In a group of healthy female nurses also undergoing a mindfulness-based stress management program or given a psychoeducation leaflet, preliminary clinical research shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids containing EPA 1200 mg and DHA 600 mg daily for 90 days modestly reduces insomnia severity when compared with placebo. However, benefits were no longer present after 6 or 12 months ( 105220 ). more Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Although there has been interest in using oral fish oil for prevention of IUGR, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fish oil for this condition. Joint pain. Oral fish oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone are unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil powder 375 mg in combination with lemon verbena extract (Monteloeder, Ltd) 230 mg six times daily for 5 weeks, followed by three capsules daily for 3 weeks, reduces symptoms of joint pain and stiffness when compared with placebo ( 17748 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to fish oil, lemon verbena, or the combination. more Kidney failure. Small clinical studies in patients with kidney failure suggest that oral fish oil may modestly improve some blood lipid and inflammatory marker levels. Some clinical research shows that taking fish oil reduces levels of inflammatory markers. A meta-analysis of clinical research and individual preliminary clinical trials in patients on hemodialysis show that taking omega-3 fatty acids, usually as fish oil, reduces C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels when compared with a control oil. Studies have used doses of up to 9 grams daily for 2-12 months ( 8685 , 65959 , 107190 ). Additional preliminary clinical research in adults on chronic hemodialysis shows that taking three packets of a specific product (Coromega) containing emulsified fish oil (EPA 350 mg and DHA 230 mg) 650 mg per packet daily for 8 weeks modestly increases hemoglobin, albumin levels, and urine output ( 8685 ). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that any benefit on hemoglobin levels is small, that albumin levels are not improved, and that mortality is not reduced ( 107190 ). Oral fish oil may also improve some, but not all, blood lipid levels in patients on hemodialysis. A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults undergoing dialysis shows that taking fish oil modestly reduces triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, but not total cholesterol levels ( 107190 ). Also, in children aged 8-17 years on chronic hemodialysis, preliminary clinical research shows that taking fish oil 2 grams daily for 3 months reduces total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL cholesterol levels and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared to baseline. It also seems to improve some inflammatory markers and quality of life ( 102396 , 103596 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. A small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil 2 grams, containing EPA 160 mg, DHA 100 mg, and d-alpha-tocopherol 0.9 IU, three times daily for 6 months does not reduce lipoprotein(a) levels, when compared with placebo ( 65997 ). more Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for preventing kidney stones. A large observational study suggests that habitual use of fish oil by adults with low to moderate genetic risk is associated with a 16% reduced risk of developing kidney stones when compared with non-users of fish oil supplements. However, fish oil use was not associated with kidney stone prevention in adults with high genetic risk ( 113208 ). more Kidney transplant-related bone loss. Clinical research suggests that oral fish oil does not improve bone mineral density following a kidney transplant. Clinical research in adults shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 2.6 grams daily, starting 8 weeks post-kidney transplant and continuing for 44 weeks, does not affect the change in bone mineral density at the hip, spine, or forearm or alter mineral metabolism when compared with olive oil as placebo. The omega-3 supplement used in the study (Omacor, Pronova Biopharma) provided eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 460 mg/gram capsule and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 380 mg/gram capsule for a total of three capsules daily ( 107179 ). A larger study population and duration are needed to confirm these findings. more Lung cancer. It is unclear if oral fish oil can improve nutritional status in patients with lung cancer. Clinical research in patients with lung cancer shows that taking fish oil providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 1.6 grams and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 0.8 grams daily for 12 weeks modestly increases body weight, serum albumin, and triglyceride levels, and decreases the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), when compared with sunflower oil as placebo. However, there was no effect on body mass index or arm circumference ( 107194 ). more Lyme disease. Although there has been interest in using oral fish oil for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fish oil for this condition. Male infertility. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for male infertility. Observational research suggests that there is a link between fish oil supplement intake and semen quantity and quality. In men who took fish oil supplements on less than 60 of the last 90 days, semen volume was 0.38 mL higher and testicular size was 0.8 mL larger than those who had taken no fish oil supplements. In men who took fish oil supplements on at least 60 of the past 90 days, semen volume was 0.64 mL higher and testicular size was 1.5 mL larger than those who had taken no fish oil supplements. These findings suggest a dose-dependent effect of fish oil. However, the validity of these findings is limited by the observational nature of the study, the unclear health status of the participants, and the lack of information on clinical fertility outcomes ( 102394 ). A meta-analysis of small randomized controlled trials in adult males with infertility shows that taking fish oil, containing DHA 400-720 mg and EPA 132-1,112 mg, orally daily for 10-32 weeks improves sperm concentration and sperm motility, but not pregnancy rates, when compared with placebo. However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups ( 111459 ). more Melanoma. It is unclear if there is a link between fish oil intake and the incidence of melanoma. An analysis of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, a prospective cohort study in over 491,000 older adults, has found that total intake of fish is associated with increased melanoma risk over a median follow-up of 15.5 years. When the lowest and highest quintiles of intake are compared, there is a 22% increase in the risk for malignant melanoma and a 28% increase in the risk for melanoma in situ. In sub-group analyses, all melanoma incidence is positively associated with tuna intake or non-fried fish intake, but malignant melanoma incidence is inversely associated with fried fish intake ( 108509 ). It was suggested that the positive associations could be due to contaminants in fish such as polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, arsenic, and mercury. more Menopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for menopausal symptoms. A meta-analysis of three clinical trials shows that fish oil supplements do not affect hot flashes, insomnia, or quality of life during menopause when compared with placebo ( 99363 ). However, a larger meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research in adults with menopausal symptoms shows that taking fish oil 300 mg-1800 with or without vitamin E 850 mg orally daily for 8-12 weeks modestly improves the intensity, but not frequency, of hot flashes when compared with control ( 111460 ). Evidence from one clinical trial also suggests that fish oil supplements might reduce night sweats ( 99363 ). In addition, clinical research shows that taking fish oil (Omega-rex, Daana Pharmaceutical Co.) 1 gram, providing EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg, daily for 12 weeks improves overall symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes, sleep problems, and anxiety, when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on blood lipid levels, urogenital symptoms, joint problems, or feelings of exhaustion ( 103492 ). more Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with MASLD. A meta-analysis of several moderate-quality clinical studies in adults with MASLD shows that taking fish oil for 3-12 months slightly improves levels of aspartate aminotransferase, and reduces triglycerides and waist circumference, when compared with placebo. There were no effects of fish oil supplementation on most other glycemic, lipid, or liver parameters ( 116624 ). The clinical significance of these findings is unclear. Furthermore, the validity of these results is limited by the lack of dosing regimen disclosure. Also review effectiveness in NAFLD, a similar condition. more Migraine headache. It is unclear if supplemental fish oil is beneficial for reducing the frequency or severity of migraine headaches. However, dietary fish oil may reduce the frequency and duration of migraine headaches. Most research shows that taking fish oil supplements providing EPA and DHA orally does not decrease the frequency or severity of migraine headaches in adolescents and adults ( 8712 , 8713 , 99361 ). However, one meta-analysis of two very small clinical trials shows that fish oil supplements might decrease the duration of migraines by an average of 3.4 hours ( 99361 ). Also, a clinical trial in patients with episodic migraines shows that taking fish oil 1 gram twice daily, providing EPA as ethyl ester 1.8 grams daily, for 12 weeks reduces the number of migraine days per month by 3.8 and the number of days requiring rescue analgesia per month by 1.2 when compared with placebo. Taking fish oil also improves headache severity, disability, anxiety, and depression. A sub-analysis shows that these beneficial effects are limited to females ( 114184 ). The reasons for these discrepancies are not clear but may be due to the dose, duration, and type of omega-3 fatty acids used. Also, some studies may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. One clinical study suggests that increasing dietary intake of fish oil may be beneficial. Increasing dietary intake of EPA plus DHA in the form of fish oil to 1.5 grams daily for 16 weeks, while maintaining dietary intake of linoleic acid at levels no greater than 7% of energy, decreases the frequency and duration of migraines, but does not improve migraine-related quality of life, when compared with intakes of EPA plus DHA of less than 150 mg daily, as is commonly found in the North American diet. Some patients also further reduced dietary linoleic acid intake. In those increasing fish oil intake and maintaining linoleic acid intake, headache duration was reduced by 1.3 hours per day; in the patients who also reduced linoleic acid intake to no more than 1.8% of energy, it was reduced by 1.7 hours per day. The duration of moderate to severe headaches was also reduced and patients had 2-4 fewer headaches each month depending on linoleic acid intake. There was no clear effect on the use of acute pain medication ( 105289 ). more Muscle strength. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for improving muscle strength in young adults. A small preliminary clinical trial in young resistance trained adults undergoing training three times weekly shows that taking fish oil (Nordic Naturals, ProOmega) 4.5 grams daily, providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 2.275 grams and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 1.575 grams, for 10 weeks modestly improves upper and lower body strength when compared with taking placebo. There were no differences between groups in lean body mass or fat mass changes ( 110341 ). more Obesity. Most clinical research shows that fish oil supplements do not improve weight loss; however, dietary fish intake might be beneficial for obesity. Clinical research also shows that taking fish oil during pregnancy does not seem to prevent overweight or obesity in the infant. It is unclear if fish oil is beneficial for improving cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight or obese children. Most research shows that fish oil supplementation does not improve weight loss in obese adults or children ( 15737 , 66004 , 89355 , 89356 , 100247 , 100250 , 106073 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that fish oil supplementation alone or with lifestyle modification does not reduce body weight or body mass index. However, fish oil supplementation seems to modestly reduce waist to hip ratio and waist circumference ( 97176 ). The reduction in waist circumference might be due to a decrease in body fat when fish oil is combined with exercise ( 15737 , 89355 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research in overweight or obese children and adolescents also shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids 250 mg to 3360 mg, usually as fish oil, for 3-52 weeks does not reduce body weight or waist circumference when compared with placebo. However, there was a modest reduction in body mass index (BMI) of approximately 1 kg/m2. Taking fish oil does not seem to improve most cardiometabolic risk factors in this population, although there were modest improvements in serum triglyceride levels and systolic blood pressure ( 106073 ). This analysis is limited by the inclusion of at least one study that investigated the use of an algae-derived docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) product. Research has also investigated the effect of fish oil supplementation on the prevention of overweight or obesity in the infant or young child when taken during pregnancy by females with overweight or obesity. Clinical research shows that taking fish oil 6 grams daily from mid-pregnancy until 3 months postpartum or when breastfeeding stopped, providing a total of 3.55 grams daily omega-3 fatty acids, does not affect infant body fat percentage or most measures of body anthropometry at 2 weeks or 3 months of age when compared with olive oil placebo. However, there was a slight increase in body mass index for age at 3 months, possibly related to increased fat mass ( 110338 ). Another clinical trial shows that taking two capsules daily of fish oil (Croda Europe Ltd.) during pregnancy and for 6 months postpartum, providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 0.22 grams and DHA 1.9 grams daily, does not prevent overweight in the child at 24 months when compared with taking placebo. The odds of overweight at 24 months were reduced by approximately 78% in children of those taking fish oil along with 10 billion colony forming units each of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HN001 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420; however, this reduction was similar to findings related to taking the probiotics alone in the absence of fish oil ( 110336 ). In contrast to fish oil supplements, dietary fish might enhance weight loss. Some evidence shows that dietary fish intake improves weight loss and decreases blood glucose and insulin concentrations in overweight and hypertensive patients when combined with a calorie-restricted diet ( 2049 ). more Oral mucositis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for oral mucositis. A small clinical trial in patients with chemotherapy-induced mucositis shows that taking fish oil 2000 mg containing 360 mg EPA and 240 mg of DHA daily for 21 days reduces mucositis severity and pain when compared with placebo ( 98246 ). more Osteoporosis. Oral fish oil has predominantly been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Epidemiological research has found that increasing intake of foods including fish that are high in omega-3 fatty acids while decreasing intake of omega-6 fatty acids is associated with higher bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip in both males and females ( 12956 , 65895 ). Clinical research shows that taking fish oil orally, in combination with evening primrose oil and calcium, for 18 months seems to decrease bone turnover and increase spinal and femoral BMD in elderly people with osteoporosis ( 7611 , 12925 ). 2000 mg of a mixture of evening primrose and fish oil (containing 60% Iinoleic acid, 8% gamma-Iinolenic acid, 4% EPA and 3% DHA), taken three times daily with meals along with calcium carbonate 600 mg has been used ( 7611 ). However, taking fish oil containing 0.45 or 4.5 grams EPA plus DHA daily for 2 years does not improve BMD in middle-aged to elderly patients with knee osteoarthritis who do not have osteoporosis ( 96122 ). more Parkinson disease. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of Parkinson disease. A large observational study suggests that habitual use of fish oil is associated with an 11% reduced risk of developing Parkinson disease when compared with non-users of fish oil supplements ( 113214 ). Also, preliminary observational research suggests that initiating supplemental fish oil is associated with a reduction in Parkinson symptoms ( 110343 ). However, this study is limited by its retrospective design and the lack of symptom specific information. more Periodontitis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for periodontitis. Preliminary clinical research in individuals with chronic mild or moderate periodontitis treated with scaling and planing shows that taking fish oil providing 180 mg EPA and 120 mg DHA daily for one or three months modestly reduces pocket depth and improves clinical attachment, when compared with taking a placebo or no fish oil ( 101545 , 110347 ). Other clinical research in patients with periodontitis also receiving scaling and planing shows that taking high-dose fish oil, containing EPA 2.6 grams, 1.8 grams DHA, and other ingredients, orally once daily for 6 months improves bleeding and plaque scores, but not pocket depth, when compared with no intervention ( 111456 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to fish oil, other ingredients, or the combination. One study shows that pocket depth is reduced by 21%, compared with 5% in those taking no fish oil; however there were no benefits on gingivitis or plaque ( 101545 ). Benefits seem to be maintained up to 3 months post-treatment ( 101545 ). more Peripheral arterial disease (PAD). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for PAD. A small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil orally appears to have no effect on walking distance in patients with stable claudication ( 1002 ). more Phenylketonuria (PKU). Small clinical studies suggest that oral fish oil may modestly improve symptoms in patients with PKU. Some small clinical trials show that taking fish oil supplements (Ameu, Omega Pharma) containing DHA 15 mg/kg daily for 3 months improves motor skills, coordination, and visual function in children with PKU when compared to control. However, it does not affect plasma levels of phenylalanine ( 65771 , 65981 ). more Pneumonia. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for pneumonia. Epidemiological research found no relationship between fish consumption and the risk of developing community-acquired pneumonia ( 13760 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Most small clinical studies suggest that oral fish oil is not beneficial for weight loss or glucose homeostasis in patients with PCOS. Small clinical trials in patients with PCOS show that taking fish oil alone or with vitamin D3 does not affect body weight or body mass index (BMI) when compared with placebo or control oils ( 21906 , 107187 , 107197 ). Also, taking fish oil does not seem to affect most measures of glucose homeostasis or blood lipids when compared to control oils ( 21906 , 107197 ). However, when used in combination with vitamin D3, taking fish oil modestly reduces levels of testosterone and results in some overall improvement in feelings of depression and anxiety ( 107187 ). Doses used in clinical trials have included fish oil (Nordic Naturals) providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 2148 mg and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 1452 mg daily for 6 weeks, or fish oil 2 grams daily plus vitamin D3 50,000 IU biweekly for 12 weeks ( 21906 , 107187 , 107197 ). more Polymyalgia rheumatica. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for polymyalgia rheumatica prevention. Oral fish oil for the prevention of polymyalgia rheumatica has been investigated in a large clinical trial of approximately 25,000 older adults. Taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 5 years providing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 0.46 grams and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 0.38 grams alone or in combination with vitamin D3 2000 IU daily does not reduce the risk of developing definite or probable polymyalgia rheumatica when compared with placebo ( 107184 ). Although this study was large, the primary endpoint was the effect of taking fish oil and/or vitamin D on the development of autoimmune diseases as a group. The number of patients with a specific autoimmune disease such as polymyalgia rheumatica was relatively small. more Postmenopausal conditions. Most research shows that oral fish oil is beneficial for improving triglyceride levels after menopause. More research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration. Lipid metabolism is often altered after menopause. A meta-analysis of mainly small clinical trials in postmenopausal females shows that taking fish oil supplements for a period of 2 weeks to 24 months decreases triglyceride levels by an average of 17.8 mg/dL when compared to placebo. The greatest evidence of benefit occurred in individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30 kg/m2 or with baseline hypertriglyceridemia. Levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, as well as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, were modestly increased. The dose of fish oil used in the individual clinical trials ranged between 285 mg and 14 grams daily, with the most evidence of benefit associated with doses of at least one gram daily ( 110351 ). more Postoperative fistula. Oral fish oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery shows that use of a specific liquid diet (Neo-Mune, Thai Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), providing supplementary arginine 12.3 grams/L, glutamine 6.15 grams/L, and fish oil 5.42 grams/L, starting 7 days before surgery and continuing for 21 days, reduces the risk of a mucocutaneous fistula diagnosis to 8%, compared with 23% of those given a hospital-prepared blended diet ( 107178 ). more Postoperative infection. Oral fish oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery shows that use of a specific liquid diet (Neo-Mune, Thai Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), providing supplementary arginine 12.3 grams/L, glutamine 6.15 grams/L, and fish oil 5.42 grams/L, starting 7 days before surgery and continuing for 21 days, does not reduce the risk of a wound infection or general infection when compared with a hospital-prepared blended diet ( 107178 ). more Postoperative recovery. Oral fish oil has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery shows that use of a specific liquid diet (Neo-Mune, Thai Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), providing supplementary arginine 12.3 grams/L, glutamine 6.15 grams/L, and fish oil 5.42 grams/L, starting 7 days before surgery and continuing for 21 days, reduces hospital length of stay by 5 days when compared with a hospital-prepared blended diet. Also, body weight was modestly higher at treatment completion in those taking the fish oil product ( 107178 ). more Postpartum depression. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for postpartum depression. Meta-analyses of available research show that taking fish oil, usually during pregnancy, has no effect on the prevention or treatment of perinatal depression when compared with placebo. In addition, when used along with supportive psychotherapy, fish oil is no more effective than therapy alone for perinatal depression ( 103493 , 104551 ). However, a meta-analysis of a small number of studies shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids might have a moderate effect on the prevention of postpartum depression ( 103493 ). The studies included in this analysis were heterogeneous. Most studies used fish oil providing EPA up to 2200 mg daily and DHA up to 1638 mg daily, but some studies in the analysis used DHA alone from algal sources ( 103493 ). more Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for PTSD. Some preliminary clinical research shows that adding omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation to psychoeducation does not further improve symptoms of PTSD in subjects that were part of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team after the Great East Japan Earthquake ( 89358 ). Additional preliminary clinical research in patients in intensive care shows that use of fish oil 18.8 grams per liter of enteral feed is no more effective than enteral feeding without fish oil in preventing symptoms of PTSD from developing up to 6 months later ( 104549 ). more Prematurity. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for improving the development of premature infants. Formula supplemented with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish oil and borage oil daily for up to 18 months seems to improve growth and neurodevelopment in preterm infants, especially boys ( 13745 ). more Pressure ulcers. It is unclear if enteral or topical fish oil is beneficial in patients with pressure ulcers. Preliminary clinical research in critically ill, hospitalized adults shows that giving enteral or parenteral formula supplemented with fish oil containing EPA 0.125-0.282 grams and DHA 0.144-0.309 grams per 100 mL for 28 days may slow the progression of grade II or higher pressure ulcers when compared with standard formula ( 89370 ). In patients with acute lung injury, other preliminary clinical research shows that giving a specific enteral emulsion (Oxepa, Ross Laboratories) providing fish oil, borage oil, and vitamins A, C and E for 7 days does not improve the healing of existing pressure ulcers when compared with a control enteral formula. Although the number of pressure ulcers in the group given the GLA-containing formula was lower when compared with the control formula, these patients also seemed to have fewer pressure ulcers at baseline and no statistical comparison was conducted. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown ( 105252 ). Topical fish oil has also been evaluated. One small clinical study shows that applying fish oil dressing once daily to the heels of immobile intensive care unit patients for 7 days does not reduce the risk for heel pressure ulcers when compared with olive oil dressing ( 102392 ). However, other clinical research in patients in the ICU shows that applying fish oil by hand to the sacrum for 30 seconds daily for up to 6 days modestly reduces the incidence of pressure ulcers when compared with soybean oil or routine care only. However, applying fish oil reduces the risk of pressure ulcers when compared with routine care, not when compared with soybean oil ( 110344 ). more Preterm labor. Research on the use of oral fish oil for the prevention of preterm labor is conflicting; however, there may be benefit of oral fish oil in patients with low baseline omega-3 status. Population research has found that eating seafood during pregnancy is associated with a reduced risk of preterm delivery when compared with never eating fish ( 65528 ). Clinical research also shows that taking a specific omega-3 fatty acids supplement (Pikasol) 2.7 to 6.1 grams, containing DHA 0.9 to 2.1 grams and EPA 1.3 to 2.9 grams, daily beginning at 20-33 weeks' gestation reduces the risk of premature delivery ( 8706 , 12972 , 66105 ). Meta-analyses of these and other studies show that taking omega-3 fatty acids, including fish oil and supplements or foods enriched in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), during pregnancy reduces the risk of early preterm delivery (gestational age less than 34 weeks) by 22% to 27% and may reduce the risk of preterm delivery (gestational age less than 37 weeks) by 10% to 11% when compared to control ( 98240 , 106069 ). However, conflicting evidence exists. The most recent meta-analysis shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of early preterm or preterm delivery when compared to control when only studies with low risk of bias were analyzed ( 106069 ). Numerous individual studies support this finding ( 66020 , 98255 , 101505 , 101540 , 102397 , 103496 , 110338 ). Some individual studies included in the meta-analysis have used a specific fish oil supplement (Incromega DHA 500TG) 900 mg containing DHA 800 mg and EPA 100 mg daily, starting at 20 weeks' gestation and continuing to delivery or 34 weeks' gestation ( 101505 ) or fish oil 2 grams daily, containing EPA 660 mg and DHA 440 mg, starting mid-gestation and continuing until the last day of the 37th week of gestation ( 102397 ). Other clinical trials not included in the meta-analysis also show that perinatal fish oil does not prevent preterm labor when compared with placebo. These studies have used fish oil 1000 mg containing EPA 180 mg and DHA 120 mg daily, starting at week 20 of gestation and continuing until birth ( 98255 ) or fish oil (Incromega TG33/22) 4 grams daily, providing 2.4 grams long chain omega-3 fatty acids, starting at about 24 weeks' gestation ( 101540 ). However, in this study, birth weight was increased by about 97 grams and gestation was increased by approximately 2 days when compared with olive oil placebo ( 101540 ). In one clinical trial, use of a high-DHA fish oil, providing EPA 100 mg and DHA 800 mg daily, from before 20 weeks' until 34 weeks' gestation, increases the risk of preterm birth prior to 34 weeks' gestation when compared with placebo in patients with baseline omega-3 status of greater than 4.9%. However, the risk is reduced from 3.2% to 0.7% in patients with baseline omega-3 status below 4.1%. In addition, taking fish oil had no effect on the risk of preterm birth prior to 37 weeks' gestation ( 103496 ). Other subgroup analyses also suggest that fish oil may be more effective in patients with low baseline omega-3 levels and singleton pregnancy ( 111457 ). The reasons for these discrepancies are not clear but may be due to the dose, duration, and type of omega-3 fatty acids used, or the baseline omega-3 status ( 102397 , 103496 ). more Prostate cancer. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for improving quality of life in patients with prostate cancer undergoing a prostatectomy. Clinical research in patients with prostate cancer shows that taking fish oil 3.75 grams (75% EPA and 10% DHA) daily, for approximately 14 months starting 7 weeks prior to radical prostatectomy, does not improve most prostate cancer-specific quality of life measures when compared with placebo. However, urinary function was improved 12 months after surgery ( 110353 ). more Pruritus. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with pruritus. A meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research in adults with pruritus while under palliative care shows that taking fish oil 2-6 grams for 20 days to 14 weeks significantly improves pruritus scores when compared with placebo ( 111455 ). more Psoriasis. It is unclear if oral or topical fish oil is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of psoriasis. Intravenous fish oil seems to reduce symptoms in patients with acute, extended guttate psoriasis or chronic plaque psoriasis. Despite some promising, low-quality studies, taking fish oil orally doesn't seem to have a significant effect on psoriasis severity ( 1035 , 8708 , 66585 , 66157 , 66233 , 102393 ). However, when administered in combination with sub-erythemal ultraviolet B (UVB) therapy, oral fish oil therapy providing EPA 3.6 grams and DHA 2.4 grams daily for 15 weeks seems to decrease the total body surface area of psoriasis when compared with placebo ( 66220 ). Topical fish oil has also been evaluated. Applying fish oil under an occlusive dressing for 6 hours daily for 4 weeks seems to improve scaling, but not erythema, in patients with psoriasis when compared with liquid paraffin ( 65575 ). The effect of oral fish oil on psoriasis prevention has been investigated in a large clinical trial of approximately 25,000 older adults. Taking fish oil 1 gram daily for 5 years providing EPA 0.46 grams and DHA 0.38 grams alone or in combination with vitamin D3 2000 IU daily does not reduce the risk of developing definite or probable psoriasis when compared with placebo ( 107184 ). Although this study was large, the primary endpoint was the effect of taking fish oil and/or vitamin D on the development of autoimmune diseases as a group. The number of patients with a specific autoimmune disease such as psoriasis was relatively small. more Raynaud syndrome. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with this condition. A small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil orally containing EPA 3.96 grams and DHA 2.64 grams daily for 12 weeks can improve tolerance to cold and delay the onset of vasospasm in people with primary Raynaud syndrome; however, people with Raynaud syndrome caused by progressive systemic sclerosis don't seem to respond to fish oil supplements ( 7573 ). more Salicylate intolerance. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with salicylate intolerance. A case series including three patients suggests that taking fish oil 10 grams daily in divided doses for 6-8 weeks might improve symptoms of salicylate intolerance ( 17410 ). High-quality, prospective research is needed to confirm this finding. more Sarcopenia. There is conflicting evidence as to whether oral fish oil improves muscle strength in adults with sarcopenia. A meta-analysis of clinical trials shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids improves lean body mass, skeletal muscle mass, and quadriceps function in older adults. Although most studies used eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a few studies used EPA alone and others used alpha-linolenic acid ( 107195 ). A network meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults with sarcopenia or at risk for sarcopenia shows that taking omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids at doses above 2.5 grams daily for 6-156 weeks improves upper-extremity muscle strength and lower-extremity physical function when compared with control or standard care. However, there was no improvement seen in skeletal muscle mass, fat mass, or overall body weight when compared with placebo or standard care. Subgroup analysis suggests that these effects endured even in the absence of concurrent resistance training programs ( 112470 ). Small clinical trials in older adults involving fish oil and increased dietary omega-3 intake show that fish oil, when used alone or in combination with a resistance exercise program, may have a small effect on some measures of muscle strength and the timed up-and-go test ( 89368 , 105222 , 109309 , 110335 ). However, one large study included in the most recent meta-analysis ( 107195 ) shows that fish oil is not beneficial for improving muscle strength in older adults. This large, high-quality clinical study in over 1,600 elderly adults shows that taking fish oil, providing DHA 800 mg and EPA 225 mg daily for 3 years, with or without physical activity and counselling, does not improve chair stand test performance or handgrip strength when compared with placebo and lifestyle interventions ( 102398 ). Also, an additional small clinical trial in older healthy adults shows that taking fish oil 3 grams daily for 18 weeks in addition to resistance training does not affect strength or functional ability when compared with resistance training plus placebo ( 98244 ). more Schizophrenia. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia. There is contradictory evidence about the effects of fish oil in patients following a single episode of psychosis. A preliminary clinical study shows that taking fish oil containing 2.2 grams of EPA and DHA daily for 26 weeks modestly reduces negative and positive symptoms and improves functioning when compared with olive oil placebo. All patients were stabilized on antipsychotic medications ( 97183 ). However, conflicting evidence exists. One small clinical study shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 150 mg, EPA 1000 mg, and DHA 500 mg twice daily does not prevent 2-year cumulative relapse or delay relapse when compared with placebo in patients who responded well to antipsychotic treatment after a single episode of psychosis ( 90675 ). A meta-analysis of these two studies shows that taking fish oil modestly reduces negative and positive symptoms and improves functioning when compared with placebo ( 105217 ). A small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil containing DHA 360 mg and EPA 540 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve most symptoms of schizophrenia, although it may modestly reduce aggression when compared with placebo ( 98256 ). Due to the general lack of supporting evidence related to the use of omega-3 fatty acids for schizophrenia, the Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that omega-3 fatty acids in doses of 1-2 grams are not recommended for adjunctive or monotherapy use in these patients ( 110318 ). more Sepsis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with sepsis. Meta-analyses of generally low-quality clinical trials show that parenteral or enteral supplementation with lipid emulsions containing refined fish oil or other omega-3 fatty acids reduces the duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the hospital by about 4 and 10 days, respectively, and reduces the need for mechanical ventilation by about 2 days when compared with placebo or no supplementation in patients with sepsis ( 98253 , 105221 , 109305 ). Also, although an earlier meta-analysis disagrees ( 98253 ), most meta-analyses show that use of fish oil-containing nutrition supplementation reduces mortality by up to 26% ( 105221 , 109305 ). This discrepancy may be related to the form of the lipid emulsion. One sub-analysis shows no beneficial effect from enteral supplementation with lipid emulsions containing fish oil. Only parenteral supplementation reduces mortality by 32% ( 109305 ). However, clinical research in patients with sepsis shows that supplementing with lipid emulsions containing refined fish oil does not prevent brain injury or delirium when compared with control ( 89323 ). more Sickle cell disease. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with sickle cell disease. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking menhaden fish oil 0.25 grams/kg containing 12% EPA and 18% DHA daily for one year reduces the frequency of severe pain episodes when compared with olive oil in patients with sickle cell disease ( 65510 ). more Sjogren syndrome. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with Sjogren syndrome. A single-center clinical study in adults with Sjogren syndrome shows that taking fish oil 2000 mg daily for 2 months modestly reduces patient-reported symptoms of dry eye and dry mouth, but not tear production, when compared with placebo. Specific dry eye improvements included reduced itching, mucous discharge, and light sensitivity. All patients also received standard care including hydroxychloroquine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications ( 116950 ). more Stroke. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in the secondary prevention of stroke or for improving recovery from a stroke. Oral supplemental fish oil does not seem to be beneficial in the primary prevention of stroke. Taking a fish oil SUPPLEMENT does not seem to be beneficial for primary prevention of stroke. Clinical research shows that taking a fish oil supplement 1 gram or 4 grams daily does not reduce the risk of stroke ( 2307 , 66185 , 103491 ). In 2017, the American Heart Association (AHA) published a science advisory stating that fish oil supplements should not be used for primary prevention of stroke in patients at high risk for CVD, as the cumulative evidence shows no benefit ( 93568 ). Furthermore, a 2018 meta-analysis including 24 studies and over 79,000 patients with or without CVD confirms that taking fish oil SUPPLEMENTS does not reduce the risk of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke ( 98231 ). The effect of DIETARY fish oil for the primary prevention of stroke is controversial. Higher serum levels of fish oil have been associated with a decreased risk of stroke ( 7372 ). Early research found that consuming fish oil from dietary sources at least once weekly is associated with a 27% reduced risk of ischemic stroke ( 7373 ). However, the method of preparing fish may be important. Eating tuna or other broiled or baked fish has been associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke, while fried fish or fish sandwiches has been associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke in elderly people ( 12923 ). There has also been some concern that consumption of very high amounts of fish oil from dietary sources might increase the risk of stroke. People who eat more than 46 grams daily of fish appear to be nearly twice as likely to have an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke ( 7603 , 7610 , 8699 ); however, these findings are questionable due to poor study design. In 2018, the American Heart Association (AHA) issued a science advisory recommending that patients consume 1-2 weekly servings of non-fried fish in place of less healthy protein options for the primary prevention of ischemic stroke ( 97185 ). However, dietary intake of fish oil may not be beneficial for stroke prevention in all patients. A 2018 meta-analysis including 4 studies and over 10,000 patients shows that increased dietary fish oil intake does not reduce the risk of stroke ( 98231 ). The majority of the studies included in this meta-analysis evaluated only patients with existing CVD. Therefore, it is possible that increased dietary intake of fish oil may not be beneficial in patients with a history of CVD. There is currently not enough reliable information available to know if increased intake of fish oil, either as part of the diet or as a supplement, has any benefit for stroke prevention in people who have already had a stroke (secondary prevention). Fish oil has also been evaluated for the improvement of symptoms in patients who are post-stroke. A meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that due to the heterogeneity and low quality of the available clinical research, it is unclear if fish oil supplements are beneficial for stroke recovery, including mood, mobility, and performance on the Glasgow Outcome Scale, or for the prevention of vascular-related death when compared with placebo or control ( 102399 ). One clinical study shows that taking fish oil 1 gram daily, starting before the stroke and continuing for a total median duration of 5.3 years, does not improve functional limitations or physical disabilities over a median 1.4 years after the first stroke ( 104550 ). However, the data was heterogeneous in this study and it is unclear what effects, if any, post-stroke supplementation of fish oil might have on these outcomes. more Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of SLE. A meta-analysis of 5 low-quality randomized controlled trials shows that taking fish oil for 12-26 weeks modestly reduces SLE symptoms ( 104548 ). However, results from individual studies are mixed ( 7571 , 7572 , 12925 , 12953 , 104548 ). A specific fish oil supplement (MaxEPA) 3-20 grams daily, alone or along with copper 3 mg daily, has been used in some studies for 24-34 weeks ( 7572 , 12953 ). The relationship between fish oil use and the development of SLE has also been investigated. However, a large population study from the United Kingdom suggests no association between fish oil use and the risk of SLE ( 114183 ). more Tinnitus. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in the prevention of tinnitus. An observational study in adults without tinnitus suggests that consuming DIETARY fish, including tuna fish, light-meat fish, or shellfish, once weekly is associated with a 13% reduced risk of persistent tinnitus, with more frequent consumption associated with a greater risk reduction. In contrast, taking SUPPLEMENTAL fish oil is associated with an increased risk of persistent tinnitus by approximately 12% ( 115738 ). The validity of these results is limited by the possibility of residual confounding, infrequent data collection on dietary intake, and the lack of data on the type of fish oil supplement used. more Ulcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis. Some clinical research shows that taking fish oil (HiEPA) providing 4.5 grams of EPA daily for 12 months can reduce corticosteroid requirements in adults with ulcerative colitis. However, fish oil does not seem to reduce relapse rates in these patients ( 1040 ). Other clinical research shows that taking fish oil 4.2 grams daily for 8 months reduces the symptoms of ulcerative colitis when compared with placebo ( 65620 ). However, another clinical study shows that a specific commercial fish oil supplement (MaxEPA, Seven Seas Ltd) does not reduce symptoms such as disease relapse, stool frequency, rectal bleeding, or rectal histology when compared with placebo ( 1037 ). Overall, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that fish oil does not reduce the relapse rate of ulcerative colitis when compared with control ( 65786 , 105224 ). Although population research has found that habitual intake of fish oil supplements is associated with a modestly reduced risk of ulcerative colitis ( 109303 ), a meta-analysis of two clinical trials shows that taking omega-3 fatty acids for about 1 year does not reduce the likelihood of an ulcerative colitis diagnosis when compared with a control group receiving monounsaturated fats ( 105224 ). Fish oil has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One clinical trial shows that taking a supplement containing fish oil in combination with fructo-oligosaccharides, gum arabic, vitamin E, and vitamin C might reduce corticosteroid requirements in patients with ulcerative colitis; however, it doesn't seem to reduce disease activity or improve histology when compared with placebo ( 13757 ). more Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial for URTI prevention or treatment. One small clinical trial in healthy athletes shows that consuming a drink fortified with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 550 mg, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 550 mg, vitamin D3 10 mcg, and whey protein 8 grams twice daily for 16 weeks does not reduce the incidence or duration of URTIs when compared with placebo ( 98243 ). However, a large clinical trial shows that taking fish oil (Incromega) 2.4 grams daily, providing 55% EPA and 37% DHA, starting at gestational week 24 and continuing until one week after birth, reduces the risk of developing croup by 38% in the offspring aged up to 3 years when compared with olive oil as placebo. This risk reduction remained after adjusting for the use of vitamin D 2800 IU daily, as well as for concomitant persistent wheeze and/or lower respiratory tract infections ( 109304 ). more Venous thromboembolism (VTE). It is unclear if dietary fish or omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial in VTE prevention. A meta-analysis of population research has found that the highest fish consumption is not associated with risk of VTE when compared with the lowest. However, overall intake of omega-3 fatty acids was associated with a small reduction in risk of VTE, as well as a modest reduction in risk of recurrent VTE ( 105223 ). more Vitamin D deficiency. It is unclear if fish oil is beneficial for vitamin D deficiency. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements for at least 8 weeks modestly increases 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels by an average of 3.8 ng/mL. A sub-group analysis shows that this benefit is limited to patients with vitamin D deficiency ( 105215 ). more Heart transplant . It is unclear if oral fish oil is beneficial in patients after a heart transplant. A small clinical trial shows that taking fish oil orally seems to preserve renal function and reduce the long-term continuous rise in blood pressure after heart transplantation. There is evidence that a dose of 4 grams of fish oil composed of 46.5% EPA and 37.8% DHA, taken daily for one year after heart transplantation, prevents changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, glomerular filtration rate, and serum creatinine when compared with placebo ( 8687 ). more More evidence is needed to rate fish oil for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Doses of 3 grams per day and less can be safely used by most people. Fish oil has Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status in the US ( 1313 , 1024 , 2299 , 2300 , 2301 , 2302 , 2315 , 2317 , 4912 , 5702 )( 5705 , 5706 , 6394 , 6399 , 7368 , 7369 , 7380 , 12921 , 12922 , 13011 )( 13766 , 14382 , 16733 , 17408 , 17991 , 17992 , 66454 , 89325 , 89336 , 89346 )( 89351 , 89352 , 89373 , 89374 , 101543 , 103492 , 103499 , 103502 , 104546 , 105220 )( 107180 , 107181 , 113220 ). Although higher doses of fish oil, such as 6 grams daily for up to 1 year, have been used safely ( 89344 ), there are some safety concerns about using high doses of fish oil. Some older research suggests that doses greater than 3 grams per day can inhibit blood coagulation and potentially increase bleeding risk ( 8671 , 8679 , 8696 , 66258 , 21223 , 21224 ). However, the most rigorous research to date shows that short-term doses of fish oil 10 grams daily and long-term doses of 1.5 grams daily for up to 52 weeks do not increase the risk of bleeding or affect coagulation parameters in chronically ill and vulnerable patients ( 97180 ). Still, doses greater than 3 grams per day might suppress immune response ( 1313 , 7384 ). Patients should only take high-dose fish oil while under medical supervision. Possibly Safe when parenteral nutrition supplemented with a lipid emulsion enriched in fish oil is used, short-term. Fish oil or omega-3 fatty acid lipid emulsions, administered intravenously for 1-4 weeks, have been safely used ( 1004 , 66042 , 66421 , 89323 , 103497 ). Possibly Unsafe when fish oil from dietary sources is consumed in large amounts. Fatty fish can contain significant amounts of toxins such as mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxin, and dioxin-related compounds. Very frequent consumption of contaminated fish can cause adverse effects such as tremor, numbness and tingling, difficulty concentrating, and vision problems. Avoid frequent consumption of swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish (also called golden bass or golden snapper), and farm-raised salmon ( 12964 , 12965 , 12966 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of fish oil when used topically. CHILDREN: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately ( 5708 , 5711 , 65732 , 66070 ). In adolescents 9 years of age and older, fish oil providing doses of up to 2250 mg omega-3 fatty acids daily have been used with apparent safety for up to 12 weeks ( 101543 ). Fish oil used in enteral feeds for up to 9 months has been shown to be safe in infants ( 13745 ). Young children should limit dietary consumption to no more than two ounces of fish per week ( 12967 , 12968 ). ...when given as part of parenteral nutrition in infants receiving long-term parenteral nutrition ( 96118 , 110340 , 110346 , 110352 ). CHILDREN: Possibly Unsafe when fish oil from dietary sources are consumed in large amounts. Fatty fish can contain significant amounts of toxins such as mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxin, and dioxin-related compounds. Frequent consumption of contaminated fish can cause brain damage, mental retardation, blindness, and seizures in children. Lower levels can cause more subtle problems such as learning disabilities ( 12964 ). Young children should limit consumption to no more than 2 ounces per week of fish ( 12967 , 12968 ). PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Intake of fish oil during pregnancy does not appear to adversely affect the fetus or nursing infant ( 1026 , 1027 , 1042 , 8706 , 12969 , 12970 , 12971 , 12972 , 12973 , 14397 )( 15015 , 15162 , 101540 , 110338 , 113217 , 114181 ). One large clinical trial shows that intake of fish oil from the 24th week of gestation increases the odds of the child having overweight and having metabolic syndrome measurements at age 10 when compared with placebo ( 114181 ). More research is needed to confirm these findings. The adequate intake level of omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy is 1.4 grams daily; the adequate intake level during lactation is 1.3 grams daily ( 89377 ). If possible, people who are trying to become pregnant, as well as those who are pregnant or lactating, should avoid swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish (also called golden bass or golden snapper), as these may contain high levels of methylmercury. Pregnant individuals should also limit consumption of other fatty fish to 12 ounces, or about 3-4 servings, per week. PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Possibly Unsafe when fish oil from dietary sources are consumed in large amounts. Fatty fish can contain significant amounts of toxins such as mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxin, and dioxin-related compounds. If possible, people who are trying to become pregnant, as well as those who are pregnant or lactating, should avoid swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish (also called golden bass or golden snapper), as these may contain high levels of methylmercury. Pregnant individuals should also limit consumption of other fatty fish to 12 ounces, or about 3-4 servings, per week ( 12967 , 12968 ).</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: Fish oil has most often been used in doses of up to 6 grams daily for up to 12 weeks. Lower doses have been used for longer durations. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Fish oil is often standardized to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at a median combined total dose of 600 mg daily, providing an EPA median dose of 340 mg daily and a DHA median dose of 270 mg daily or 55% EPA and 37% DHA ( 12982 , 66177 , 96120 , 101548 , 112466 ). Topical: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Children Oral: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization &amp; Formulation Fish oil is commonly standardized to EPA and DHA content. Some formulations of fish oil used in clinical research include: Omacor, now known as Lovaza, which contains EPA 465 mg, DHA 375 mg, and vitamin E 4 mg per capsule ( 12982 , 66177 , 101548 ); MaxEPA, which contains EPA 180 mg plus DHA 120 mg per capsule ( 66177 ); Omega Rx, which contains EPA 400 mg, DHA 200 mg, and vitamin E 100 mg per capsule ( 66177 ); and Incromega TG33/22 which is 55% EPA and 37% DHA ( 96120 , 109304 ). Fish oil supplements often contain small amounts of vitamin E as an antioxidant to prevent spoilage. They might also be combined with calcium, iron, or vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, C, or D. Fish that are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids include mackerel, tuna, salmon, sturgeon, mullet, bluefish, anchovy, sardines, herring, trout, and menhaden ( 10007 ). The specific omega-3 fatty acid content of fish in a 3 ounce serving is as follows: Catfish = 0.15-2 grams Cod = 0.13-0.24 grams Flounder/Sole = 0.42 grams Halibut = 0.4-1 grams Herring = 1.71-1.81 grams Mackerel = 0.34-1.57 grams Rainbow trout = 0.84-0.98 grams Salmon (Atlantic, Farmed) = 1.09 - 1.83 grams Salmon (Atlantic, Wild) = 0.9 - 1.56 grams Salmon (Chinook) = 1.48 grams Salmon (pink) = 1.09 grams Salmon (sockeye) = 0.68 grams Sardines = 0.98-1.70 grams Tuna (light, canned) = 0.26 grams</data><data key="interactions_text">Expand All | Collapse All ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Fish oil may have antiplatelet effects and may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. However, evidence is conflicting. While fish oil may not be a potent inhibitor of platelet function, high doses of fish oil might have antiplatelet effects. Theoretically, concomitant use of fish oil with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs may increase the risk of bleeding ( 8671 , 8679 , 8696 , 13769 , 21223 , 21224 , 66258 ). However, the most rigorous research shows that short-term doses of fish oil 10 grams daily or long-term doses of 1.5 grams daily for up to 52 weeks does not increase the risk of bleeding or affect coagulation parameters in chronically ill and vulnerable patients ( 97180 ). Other controlled research shows that fish oil does not affect platelet function or increase the risk of bleeding ( 17990 , 17996 , 66105 , 66267 , 89374 , 107180 ). Some research even suggests that perioperative fish oil use decreases bleeding risk ( 89352 ). Some research suggests fish oil does not have additive antiplatelet effects when combined with aspirin ( 13769 ), but other clinical evidence suggests that adding fish oil to low-dose aspirin treatment increases antiplatelet effects in patients who are aspirin-resistant ( 21226 ). Also, some clinical research seems to show that fish oil has additive antiplatelet effects when used with aspirin and clopidogrel compared to aspirin and clopidogrel alone ( 21225 ). more ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, taking fish oil with antihypertensive drugs might increase the risk of hypotension. Clinical evidence indicates that fish oils can modestly lower blood pressure and might have additive effects in patients treated with antihypertensives ( 1001 , 1020 , 1030 , 1033 , 66095 , 66100 , 66215 , 66331 , 66358 , 66379 , 66385 ). more CONTRACEPTIVE DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, taking fish oil with contraceptive drugs might decrease the triglyceride-lowering effects of fish oil. There is some evidence that contraceptive drugs might interfere with the triglyceride lowering effects of fish oils ( 8694 ). more CYCLOSPORINE (Neoral, Sandimmune) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Taking fish oil with cyclosporine might increase levels and adverse effects of cyclosporine. In kidney transplant recipients on a general immunosuppressive regimen, taking omega-3 fatty acids daily seems to increase peak blood levels of cyclosporine when compared with placebo. This increase was as much as 20% after one month. However, the area under the curve was not significantly affected ( 66472 ). more ORLISTAT (Xenical, Alli) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, taking fish oil with orlistat might decrease the absorption of fish oil fatty acids. Orlistat binds lipase in the gastrointestinal tract and reduces fat absorption. Theoretically, taking fish oil with orlistat might decrease absorption of fish oil fatty acids. To avoid this potential interaction, recommend separating administration of orlistat and fish oil by at least 2 hours. more PLATINUM AGENTS Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, taking fish oil with platinum agents can cause resistance to platinum agents, potentially decreasing their effectiveness. Platinum-induced fatty acids (PIFAs) are fatty acids secreted from human and mouse stem cells when exposed to platinum-based chemotherapy. Animal research suggests that PIFAs cause resistance to chemotherapy by stimulating lysophospholipid production in the spleen, which interferes with the DNA damage caused by certain chemotherapy drugs ( 92076 ). One PIFA, known as 16:4(n-3), has been found in both raw fish and some commercially available fish oil products. Mackerel and herring have high PIFA concentrations, while salmon and tuna have low PIFA concentrations. Levels of PIFA in commercial fish oil products ranged from 0.2- 5.7 microMol. Animal research shows that PIFA-containing fish oil products cause resistance to cisplatin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin ( 91250 , 92075 ). It is unclear if all commercially available fish oil products contain PIFAs. Additionally, it is argued that levels of PIFA found in some fish oil products are too low to be of clinical concern. Furthermore, a lack of chemotherapy resistance in countries with high fish intake, such as Greenland, Japan, and Norway, suggest that this interaction may not be clinically significant ( 91288 , 91289 ). more SIROLIMUS (Rapamune) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Case-control study) Taking fish oil with sirolimus might increase levels and adverse effects of sirolimus. Pharmacokinetic research shows that omega-3 fatty acids increase exposure to sirolimus in kidney transplant patients on a calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppressive regimen. A 25% dose reduction in sirolimus was required to keep patients within the expected trough-concentration window ( 105232 ). Researchers hypothesize that this may be due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) by fish oil, although this has not been confirmed in clinical research. more TACROLIMUS (Prograf) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Taking fish oil with tacrolimus might increase levels and adverse effects of tacrolimus. In a small group of patients, taking fish oil 2.6 grams (Omacor) daily for 4 weeks increased the 8-hour area under the curve of tacrolimus by 25% when compared with baseline. Peak levels were increased by approximately 22% ( 105212 ). Researchers hypothesize that this may be due either to an increase in bioavailability or to inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) by fish oil, although this has not been confirmed in clinical research. more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Fish oil may have antiplatelet effects and might increase the risk of bleeding if used with warfarin. Fish oil has antiplatelet effects at high doses. Case reports show elevated INR in patients taking warfarin and fish oil 1-2 grams daily ( 21222 , 21223 ). However, some clinical research shows that taking fish oil 3-6 grams daily does not significantly increase INR in patients taking warfarin ( 8801 ). more</data><data key="name">Fish Oil</data><data key="scientific_name">Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid</data><data key="overview_text">Fish oil comes from a variety of fish and is a source of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids.

Active constituents of ginger include gingerol, gingerdione, shogaol, and sesquiterpene and monoterpene volatile oils ( 12632 , 16305 , 51791 , 51836 , 101759 ). The chemical constituents of ginger vary among fresh, semi-dry, and dry forms of ginger ( 12632 ).These constituents seem to have a variety of pharmacological properties including antipyretic, analgesic, antitussive, anti-inflammatory, sedative, antibiotic, weak antifungal, and other properties ( 7628 , 12632 ). However, all of these pharmacological effects may not occur when whole ginger preparations are used. Analgesic effects Ginger is traditionally used for low back and stomach pain. In human research, ginger, with or without feverfew, is effective at reducing pain associated with migraine headaches ( 19357 , 22602 , 89894 , 101761 ). Ginger may also help in the reduction of muscle pain following eccentric exercise ( 17933 ). Analgesic effects of ginger have also been shown in animal pain models ( 20403 ). In animal research, a possible mechanisms of action has been suggested relating to the inhibitory effect of 6-shogaol on the release of substance P ( 51828 ). Substance P is a neuropeptide that is associated with inflammation and pain. Another possible mechanism of action is the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by gingerols and shogaols ( 101761 ). Anthelmintic effects There is preliminary evidence that ginger may have anthelmintic effects ( 7628 ). In animal research, both ginger powder and ginger extract had anthelmintic effects with respective maximum reductions of 25.6% and 66.6% in eggs per gram (EPG) of feces on day 10 of post-treatment in sheep ( 51924 ). Anti-diabetic effects Animal and human evidence suggests that ginger may increase insulin levels and/or decrease blood glucose levels ( 12636 , 20402 , 20403 , 20404 , 20405 , 89895 , 89896 , 107898 ). Also, in laboratory models of diabetes, ginger seems to increase the release of insulin and lower cholesterol levels ( 12636 ). In streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, ginger produced a significant increase in insulin levels and a decrease in fasting glucose levels and also caused a decrease in serum cholesterol, serum triglyceride, and blood pressure ( 12636 , 20402 , 20403 , 20404 , 20405 ). Anti-emetic effects The mechanism of action of ginger's effect on nausea and vomiting remains uncertain. However, there are several proposed mechanisms that have been investigated in laboratory models. The ginger constituents gingerols and shogaols might have antiemetic effects ( 51900 ). Preclinical research has shown that the 6-gingerol constituent can inhibit neurokinin-1, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. This might be one of the mechanisms by which ginger reduces nausea and vomiting ( 1924 , 97539 ). In fact, some clinical research shows that adding 6-gingerol 10 mg twice daily to standard antiemetic therapy with ondansetron, metoclopramide, and dexamethasone seems to reduce the need for rescue therapy and reduce both acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced vomiting compared to standard antiemetic therapy alone in cancer patients located in Asia and receiving mostly highly emetogenic chemotherapy ( 97539 ). Some researchers have suggested that ginger might work by increasing gastrointestinal (GI) motility ( 1923 , 52001 , 52150 ). However, some evidence shows that ginger does not influence GI emptying time ( 7621 , 7624 ). Other ginger constituents such as 6-shogaol and galanolactone seem to act on serotonin and muscarinic receptors in the GI tract ( 1924 , 18211 , 52049 , 52187 ). Galanolactone seems to act primarily on 5-HT3 receptors in the ileum, which are the same receptors affected by some prescription antiemetics such as ondansetron (Zofran). The gingerols and shogaols from ginger all appear to have 5-HT3 receptor antagonistic effects ( 51900 , 51917 , 52049 ). The predominant antiemetic action of ginger is localized in the GI tract, but there is some evidence that ginger constituents may also have central nervous system (CNS) activity ( 1924 , 18211 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Ginger is sometimes used for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anti-inflammatory effects of ginger have been shown in various animal models ( 20403 , 52035 ). Researchers speculate that certain constituents of ginger inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase pathways, and leukotrienes, as shown in laboratory research ( 7401 , 18210 , 51859 , 51868 ). In human and laboratory research, ginger inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines ( 12473 , 51887 , 52031 , 52035 , 89886 , 103355 , 107899 ), possibly via inhibition of the NF kappa B pathway ( 52038 , 52043 , 52053 , 100697 ) and stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) ( 52053 ). It also seems to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2), which mediate inflammation ( 12634 , 51932 , 52031 ). PGE2 levels decreased in human colonic mucosa following intake of ginger root extract ( 52091 ). The effect of ginger on the NF kappa B pathway also appears to attenuate the production of nitric oxide synthase in laboratory research ( 51933 ). Anti-platelet effects Laboratory research shows that ginger inhibits platelet aggregation. However, this has not been demonstrated unequivocally in humans ( 96257 ). In human research, taking ginger 5 grams with a fatty meal inhibited platelet aggregation ( 52126 ). However, taking a lower dose of 2 grams did not reduce platelet aggregation in the absence of a high fat meal ( 52128 ). The antiplatelet effect of ginger is thought to be exerted by the ability of some of its constituents to inhibit platelet thromboxane ( 7622 , 12634 , 52105 , 52120 ). However, in human research ginger did not inhibit thromboxane production ( 52139 ). Antibacterial effects It is possible that ginger may be beneficial for bacterial infections. Laboratory research suggests ginger extract, ginger essential oils, and ginger constituents have antibacterial effects against a range of organisms, such as Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes ( 51821 , 51912 , 52021 ). In vitro, ginger extract inhibited the growth of Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni, bacteria that play a role in gastrointestinal symptoms ( 39783 , 49487 ). Antifungal effects Ginger exerted antifungal effects against a wide range of fungi, including drug-resistant strains, via its constituents, 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerols and 6-gingerdiol ( 51824 , 51836 ). However, other studies reported low efficacy of ginger essential oils against various fungi ( 52026 ). Antioxidant effects The antioxidant effects of ginger may explain some of its clinical effects. Ginger and its constituents, including 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerol, and 6-shogaol, have demonstrated antioxidant effects such as increasing glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in various forms of research, including in vitro, animal, and clinical research ( 4067 , 40694 , 51827 , 51843 , 51891 , 51906 , 51915 , 51959 , 51976 , 51990 )( 52064 , 52066 , 52069 , 105059 , 107900 ). Blood pressure effects There is interest in using ginger to lower blood pressure. Animal research shows that fresh ginger extract blocks calcium channels, stimulates muscarinic receptors, and has negative inotropic and chronotropic effects ( 12633 , 51905 ). However, preliminary clinical research in patients with diabetes shows that drinking black tea containing 3 grams of ginger three times daily for 8 weeks does not affect endothelial function nor reduce blood pressure by a clinically significant amount when compared with placebo ( 96669 ). Other preliminary clinical research in healthy adult females shows that taking ginger extract 600 mg orally daily for 3 months also does not lower blood pressure when compared with placebo ( 109520 ). Cognitive effects Ginger might increase levels of dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine in the brain cortex and hippocampus, which could improve cognitive function ( 110132 ). Gastrointestinal effects There is interest in using oral ginger for modulation of the fecal microbiome. A small clinical study in adults with colorectal adenoma shows that taking ginger 500 mg orally for 6 weeks does not improve fecal microbial diversity when compared with placebo ( 113771 ). Gastroprotective effects Ginger is traditionally used for stomach and gastrointestinal ailments. Also, gastroprotective effects of ginger have been shown in various animal models ( 52099 ). Preliminary research suggests gastroprotective effects of ginger might be due to increases in levels of protective prostaglandins in the gut wall ( 18210 ). In an animal model of ulcerative colitis, ginger extract improved levels of inflammatory cytokines and improved antioxidant effects, suggesting these pathways may play a role ( 52007 ). Animal research suggests the constituents zingiberene and 6-gingerol may be the important constituents ( 52107 ). The constituent 6-gingerol inhibited the formation of HCl-induced gastric lesions, possibly through an interaction with the vanilloid-receptor ( 51863 ). Some constituents of ginger have been shown to affect intestinal motility in animal models. For example, 6-shogaol when given orally enhanced gastrointestinal motility ( 51908 , 52096 ) and ginger extract prevented a delay in gastric emptying ( 51811 ). In patients with functional dyspepsia, a single dose of ginger also increased gastric emptying ( 20325 ). Immunomodulating effects Preliminary clinical research in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) shows that ginger increases FoxP3 gene expression. This allows for proper development of regulatory T cells, which help suppress the autoimmune response of effector T cells. Ginger also appears to decrease the expression of the ROR gamma t and T-bet genes, both of which are believed to be involved in the autoimmune process ( 100697 ). Insecticidal effects In human research, a topical application of Trikatu, which contains ginger, long pepper, and black pepper extracts does not reduce the papule size associated with mosquito bites ( 89893 ). However, ginger is traditionally used for its insecticidal effects. Ginger has demonstrated both larvicidal and repellent activity against various types of mosquitoes ( 51996 , 52024 ). Also, its essential oils have demonstrated ovicidal activity against mosquito species ( 31384 ), which may be attributed to 4-gingerol ( 52009 ). Lipid-lowering effects Clinical evidence suggests that taking ginger reduces triglyceride and cholesterol levels in patients with hyperlipidemia ( 20327 ). Similar effects have been shown in animal research ( 12634 , 51916 , 52147 ). Other studies failed to demonstrate any lipid-lowering effects of ginger ( 46881 ). In an animal model of hyperlipidemia, ginger decreased the endothelium intima-media thickness ( 51952 ). Musculoskeletal effects There is interest in using ginger to treat various musculoskeletal conditions. Preliminary clinical research in generally healthy adults with self-reported shoulder stiffness shows that taking ginger extract 100 mg orally daily for 8 weeks does not improve stiffness scores when compared with placebo ( 114782 ). Mutagenic effects There is very preliminary evidence that some extracts and constituents of ginger might have mutagenic properties. However, these constituents may only be mutagenic when in the presence of other mutagens. Whole ginger preparations may not have mutagenic effects. Also, other ginger constituents such as zingerone have the opposite effect and are antimutagenic ( 11299 ). Ginger constituents 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol have also demonstrated antimutagenic effects. Preliminary research shows that shogaol and 6-gingerol increased apoptosis of head and neck cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner ( 97540 ). Ophthalmic effects There is interest in using ginger to treat various ophthalmic conditions. Preliminary clinical research in generally healthy adults with self-reported eye fatigue shows that taking ginger extract 100 mg orally daily for 8 weeks modestly improves fatigue scores, but not ocular blood flow, when compared with placebo ( 114782 ). Respiratory effects Ginger is traditionally used in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, cough, respiratory distress, and bronchitis. Ginger does not appear to benefit respiratory function in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ( 89702 ). However, administration via nasogastric tubing improves symptoms in adults with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) ( 20343 , 89886 ). Mechanisms of action are unclear. However, in laboratory research, ginger inhibits airway contraction and associated Ca(2+) signaling, possibly via blockade of plasma membrane Ca(2+) channels ( 52002 ). In a mouse model of Th2-mediated pulmonary inflammation, ginger aqueous extract, administered intraperitoneally prior to airway challenge, resulted in a marked decrease in the recruitment of eosinophils to the lungs ( 52015 ). Sex hormone effects Ginger inhibits thromboxane synthetase. This could affect testosterone receptor binding in the fetus and theoretically affect sex steroid differentiation of the fetal brain ( 7083 ). However, this has not been seen in animals or humans. In animal research, ginger extract increased testosterone levels and the weight of the testis ( 51822 ). Teratogenic effects Animal research hasn't shown any evidence of teratogenicity ( 11297 , 11298 ). However, one study did find evidence of embryo mortality ( 11298 ). Weight loss effects There is interest in using ginger for weight loss. Mechanisms of action have been explored in animal models using ginger constituents and ginger extracts. Azingerone reduced body weight and adipose tissue weight in ovariectomized rats, an effect that may be a result of an increase in norepinephrine-induced lipolysis in adipocytes ( 52012 ). In vitro, ginger, possibly via one of the gingerols, enhanced adipocyte differentiation ( 51880 ). However, clinical research in non-obese adults shows that ginger does not affect postprandial energy expenditure, resting energy expenditure, respiratory quotient, or levels of hormones involved in satiety when compared with placebo, although self-reported feelings of satiety were reduced ( 52095 , 109520 ). Preliminary clinical research in overweight individuals is conflicting and shows ginger may reduce body weight and body fat when used as part of a specific diet and exercise program, but not when used alone ( 20346 , 20347 , 40802 , 109520 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Likely Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Ginger</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Dysmenorrhea. In people with dysmenorrhea, taking oral ginger seems to reduce pain. Clinical research shows that ginger might be comparable to ibuprofen or mefenamic acid. In addition, taking ginger seems to be beneficial when used as an adjunct to mefenamic acid 250 mg twice daily. Clinical research in individuals at least 15 years of age shows that ginger can reduce pain from dysmenorrhea. Clinical studies show that taking ginger powder 500-2000 mg daily usually for the first 3-4 days of a menstrual cycle modestly decreases pain severity by an average of 2.3-2.7 points on a 10-point scale when compared to control groups ( 89889 , 89899 , 91139 , 91892 , 96255 , 106077 ). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking ginger does not reduce pain duration when compared with placebo ( 106077 ). Clinical research also shows that ginger might be as effective as some anti-inflammatory agents. Taking a specific ginger extract (Zintoma, Goldaru) 250 mg four times daily for 3 days at the beginning of the menstrual period or until pain relief improves symptoms similarly to ibuprofen or mefenamic acid ( 17931 , 96259 , 106077 ). Also, taking a ginger extract 200 mg four times daily for 3-4 days at the beginning of pain is equally effective to taking Novafen, a combination of acetaminophen, caffeine, and ibuprofen ( 99444 ). Ginger also seems to improve pain when given as an adjunct to anti-inflammatory agents. A small clinical study in young females with dysmenorrhea shows that adding ginger (Vomigone, Dineh Co.) 500 mg daily to mefenamic acid 250 mg twice daily for 5 days further reduces pain when compared with taking mefenamic acid alone ( 102464 ). more Osteoarthritis. Most clinical research shows that taking ginger extract by mouth improves pain in some patients with osteoarthritis. Topical ginger, on the other hand, has not shown benefit for knee osteoarthritis in low quality research. Meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking ginger extract 500-1000 mg daily for 3-12 weeks can modestly improve pain when compared with placebo in some patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip ( 96253 , 103357 ). However, a meta-analysis of two clinical studies shows that taking ginger extract about 500 mg daily for 6 weeks does not have an effect on function ( 103357 ). One small clinical trial in patients with mild osteoarthritis of the knee also shows that taking steamed golden ginger extract 480 mg daily for 12 weeks moderately improves pain and functional scores when compared with placebo ( 114784 ). Some clinical research has also compared ginger to conventional drug treatment. In one clinical trial, there was no significant difference between ginger extract 30 mg daily and ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily for one month in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee ( 17930 ). However, taking a specific ginger extract (Eurovita Extract 33; EV ext-33) orally 170 mg three times daily for 3 weeks was significantly less effective than ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily for reducing pain ( 7048 ). Since ginger is thought to take several weeks for significant benefit, this trial might not have lasted long enough. Ginger has also been compared with diclofenac. When used orally as 1500 mg daily in two divided doses, ginger is less effective than oral diclofenac 100 mg daily in two divided doses, or the combination of ginger and diclofenac, for 12 weeks ( 89898 ). Various studies have evaluated formulations containing ginger with other ingredients. These combinations have all been shown to improve osteoarthritis pain, and in some cases, functionality. Studied formulations include ginger (Eurovita Extract 35; EV ext-35) 340 mg with glucosamine (Zinaxin glucosamine, Ferrosan AS) 1000 mg daily for 4 weeks, a ginger extract with an alpinia (Alpinia galanga) extract (Eurovita Extract 77; EV ext-77) 255 mg twice daily for 6 weeks, a ginger extract with curcuminoids, and extracts of devil's claw, Boswellia serrata, and celery (Tregocel) for 36 weeks, or Ayurvedic shunthi-guduchi formulations containing ginger, Indian gooseberry, and Tinospora cordifolia, either with or without Boswellia serrata ( 7084 , 18210 , 89557 , 106078 ). However, it's too early to know if the effects of these combination agents are associated with ginger or other ingredients in the formulations. Topical ginger, alone or in combination with other ingredients, has also been studied for knee osteoarthritis. Although a meta-analysis of two randomized clinical trials shows no evidence of benefit of topical ginger for pain and disability when compared with placebo or standard therapy ( 103357 ), some benefits have been shown in individual preliminary studies ( 20340 , 20341 , 89897 , 96668 , 97537 , 97542 ). These trials have used a specific gel containing ginger and plai 4% by weight (Plygersic gel, Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research) 4 grams/day in four divided doses for 6 weeks ( 89897 ), an ointment composed of ginger, cinnamon, mastic (Saghez), and sesame oil twice daily for 6 weeks ( 20340 ), or one gram of ginger extract 5% (standardized to 11.18% of 6-gingerol) in a nanostructure lipid carrier three times daily for up to 12 weeks to the affected knee ( 96668 , 97537 ). Some studies have used ginger essential oil in a massage oil, alone or with sweet orange essential oil or standard therapy, twice weekly for 3 or 6 weeks ( 20341 , 97542 ). more Pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral ginger seems to reduce the severity of nausea and vomiting in some people during pregnancy. Ginger seems to be more effective than placebo, comparable to vitamin B6 or dimenhydrinate, and less effective than metoclopramide. Although most clinical studies are small and have methodological limitations, the available research shows that ginger is more effective than placebo, and comparable to vitamin B6 or dimenhydrinate ( 721 , 1922 , 5343 , 11346 , 13071 , 16306 , 20312 , 20315 , 90103 , 91201 , 102462 ). Although ginger is comparable to dimenhydrinate for reducing symptoms of morning sickness, it seems to take about 3 days to reduce vomiting episodes compared to 1 day with dimenhydrinate ( 16305 ). In addition, clinical research shows that ginger is less effective than metoclopramide at relieving nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy ( 20315 ). Ginger doses of 500 to 2500 mg daily, divided into two to four daily doses for 3 days to 3 weeks, have been used in clinical research ( 721 , 5343 , 16305 , 16306 , 20312 , 20315 , 90103 , 91201 ). The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) considers ginger capsules 250 mg 4 times daily a first-line nonpharmacological treatment option for pregnancy-induced nausea based on limited evidence. However, there is no evidence that ginger reduces vomiting ( 111601 ). more Possibly Ineffective Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Most clinical research shows that oral ginger does not reduce acute or delayed CINV. The effect of ginger might depend on the dose, the other antiemetics used, or the specific chemotherapy regimen. Most clinical research shows that taking ginger as adjunct to adequate antiemetic therapy does not reduce DELAYED CINV when compared with antiemetic therapy alone ( 20316 , 96260 , 89891 , 96675 , 97538 , 97541 , 101760 , 102461 , 113616 ). Clinical research from meta-analyses and most individual clinical studies also show that taking ginger 0.5-3.5 grams as an adjunct to standard antiemetic therapy does not reduce the incidence or severity of ACUTE CINV when compared with antiemetic therapy alone ( 89891 , 96675 , 101760 , 102461 , 102466 , 113616 ). However, conflicting results exist from some individual clinical studies ( 20316 , 102466 ). These individual studies evaluated powdered ginger root or liquid extract of ginger root 0.5-2 grams taken in two to four divided doses daily, starting on either the day of or 3 days before chemotherapy and continuing for 3-5 days after chemotherapy initiation ( 20316 , 102466 ). Also, one small study shows that ginger in doses of 1 gram or less for more than 3 days reduces the likelihood of acute vomiting by 60% ( 101760 ). More research is needed to confirm the efficacy of this lower dose. Reasons for the conflicting results are unclear, but several theories have been postulated. One theory is that ginger might help reduce CINV associated with some, but not all, chemotherapy regimens. One preliminary clinical study shows that ginger 500 mg twice daily for 3 days reduces vomiting in patients receiving cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, but not in patients also receiving 5-fluorouracil or docetaxel ( 96251 ). However, since there is limited evidence supporting this theory, additional research is needed to confirm. Another theory is that ginger helps when used with certain antiemetic drugs, but not others. For example, ginger seems to help in cases when optimal antiemetic therapy, such as 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, is not available. Small clinical studies show that ginger reduces the severity of acute nausea when compared with prochlorperazine or metoclopramide, both of which are suboptimal antiemetic therapy for CINV ( 89891 ). Another small study shows that ginger is comparable to metoclopramide for improving delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea ( 13244 ). On the other hand, several studies show that taking ginger 0.5-2 grams daily along with antiemetic therapy that includes aprepitant does NOT improve acute or delayed CINV ( 20318 , 89891 , 96251 , 96675 ). In fact, one study found an association between concomitant use of ginger 2 grams daily with aprepitant and worsened severity of delayed nausea. Ginger is hypothesized to decrease the absorption of aprepitant and reduce its effectiveness for delayed nausea ( 20318 , 96675 ). However, this effect has not been replicated, and aprepitant serum levels were not measured to confirm this hypothesis. Finally, many of the studies showing a benefit of ginger for CINV when used as an adjunct to standard antiemetic therapy are considered to be methodologically flawed ( 20317 , 96252 , 96677 ). For instance, one study using powdered ginger root 1-2 grams daily during the first three days of chemotherapy in children and adults ( 20317 ) has been criticized for inaccurately representing data ( 89891 ). Other studies of ginger 500 mg twice daily for up to 10 days used questionable methods to measure outcomes and usually did not differentiate between acute and delayed CINV ( 96252 , 96677 ). Ginger essential oil aromatherapy has also been evaluated. One small study shows that using two drops of ginger essential oil on an aromatherapy necklace for 2 minutes daily for 5 days, starting on the first day of chemotherapy, reduces acute nausea, but not vomiting or delayed nausea, when compared with placebo in females with breast cancer taking standard antiemetics including granisetron, dexamethasone, and metoclopramide ( 96256 ). more Exercise-induced muscle soreness. Most research shows that oral ginger in single or multiple doses does not prevent or treat exercise-induced muscle soreness. Two small studies in healthy adults show that single doses of ginger supplements do not seem to reduce muscle soreness from exercise. Taking capsules of ground ginger 2 grams, 30 minutes before a 30-minute cycling bout, or 24-48 hours after eccentric exercise, does not reduce muscle pain during exercise or within one hour of ingestion when compared with placebo ( 17932 , 17934 ). Taking multiple doses also does not seem to help. One small study in healthy adults shows that taking capsules with ginger powder 4 grams daily for 5 days before high-intensity eccentric exercise does not reduce muscle soreness over 4 days when compared with placebo ( 96258 ). Another small study in healthy adults shows that taking capsules of heated or raw ground ginger 2 grams daily for 8 days prior to eccentric exercise, and continuing supplementation for 3 more days, might modestly reduce muscle soreness 24 hours post-exercise, but not at later time points, when compared with placebo ( 17933 , 96258 ). Ginger has also been tested in combination with other ingredients. One small study in healthy adults shows that taking a specific combination product (ReWin(d), Natural Origins) containing a 4:3 ratio of ginger and annatto powder, 2 grams in divided doses daily for 4 weeks before eccentric exercise and continuing for 3 days after exercise, may modestly reduce muscle pain 48 hours after exercise but not at other time points ( 105057 ). This study was funded by the supplement manufacturer. more Motion sickness. Most research shows that oral ginger does not prevent or treat motion sickness. Most clinical research shows that taking ginger 500-1000 mg up to 4 hours prior to travel does not prevent motion sickness ( 7624 , 7625 , 20330 , 20331 ). Some patients report subjective feelings of improvement, but in many studies objective measures did not significantly improve ( 7400 ). However, one clinical trial suggests that ginger is more effective than dimenhydrinate at reducing gastrointestinal distress associated with motion sickness ( 20332 ). Another clinical study seems to show that taking ginger 1-2 grams as a single dose reduces nausea severity and increases the latency before the onset of nausea caused by simulated motion sickness when compared to baseline ( 20333 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Some small clinical studies show that giving ginger with tube feeds to hospitalized patients might reduce the duration of serious sequelae from ARDS. A small clinical trial in adults with ARDS shows that administering ginger extract 120 mg in three divided doses daily via nasogastric tubing for 21 days increases the number of ventilator-free days and the amount of feeding tolerated and decreases the number of intensive care unit (ICU) days when compared with placebo. However, it does not seem to improve overall mortality ( 20343 ). Also, another small clinical study shows that adding ginger extract 120 mg to tube feeds in three divided doses daily for 8-21 days improves blood oxygen levels by 13% to 20%, as well as the ability of the lungs to expand by 17%, when compared with a coconut oil placebo. The duration of mechanical ventilation and stay in the ICU also improved. However, ginger does not affect other measurements of lung function or physical organ damage in these patients ( 89886 ). more Allergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial in allergic rhinitis. A small clinical trial shows that taking ginger extract 500 mg daily for 6 weeks is as effective as loratadine 10 mg daily for reducing nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis ( 103359 ). more Antiretroviral-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral ginger seems to improve nausea and vomiting in patients using antiretroviral agents. A small clinical study in patients with HIV shows that taking ginger 0.5 grams twice daily, 30 minutes prior to each dose of antiretroviral for 14 days, reduces the relative likelihood of nausea and vomiting by about 63% and 79%, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 89887 ). more Asthma. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition. Atopic dermatitis (eczema). Topical ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A moderate-sized clinical trial in adults and children with eczema shows that applying a combination topical product containing ginger and cannabidiol twice daily for 5 days moderately improves eczema scores, including erythema, dryness, itching, and scaling, when compared to baseline. It is unclear if this effect is due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group ( 114783 ). more Back pain. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for back pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition. Burns. Although there has been interest in using topical ginger for burns, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition. Cancer-related anorexia. It is unclear if oral ginger improves appetite in people with cancer-related anorexia. A small clinical study in patients with cancer-related anorexia and cachexia shows that taking a capsule containing ginger 1650 mg daily for 14 days improves nausea, appetite, reflux, dysmotility, and other gastrointestinal symptoms when compared to baseline ( 102460 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of comparator group. more Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product (AKL1, AKL International Ltd.) containing ginkgo extract, ginger, and Picrorhiza kurroa twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve respiratory symptoms when compared with placebo in patients with COPD ( 89702 ). Another moderate-sized clinical study in adults with COPD shows that taking a combination product containing extracts of ginger, alpinia, cardamom, cinnamon, and saffron in honey 3 times daily for 8 weeks improves confidence in leaving home and the ratio of forced exploratory volume per second to forced vital capacity of the lungs (FEV1/FVC) when compared with placebo. However, the combination product does not improve most measures of respiratory function or symptoms such as cough, phlegm, chest tightness, dyspnea, reduced energy levels, sleeping disorders, or activity limitations when compared with placebo ( 111542 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. more Colic. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for colic, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition. Constipation. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for constipation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear whether oral ginger is beneficial for patients with COVID-19. Clinical research in adults hospitalized with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection shows that taking ginger 1.5 grams twice daily orally until hospital discharge reduces length of stay from around 8.5 days to 6 days, when compared with placebo. The strongest effect is seen in males over 60 years of age ( 110005 ). The relevance of these results is reduced by a lack of blinding, and the fact that the subjects were initially asymptomatic. Another small study in adults with COVID-19 treated in the community shows that taking ginger 1000 mg three times a day for 7 days does not improve viral clearance, oxygen saturation, or respiratory rate when compared with placebo. Taking ginger also did not reduce the risk of hospitalization ( 114779 ). The efficacy of ginger for treating COVID-19 has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. In adults with uncomplicated, moderate COVID-19, taking a combination of ginger, turmeric, ashwagandha, and boswellia (BV-4051, Artovid-20), 1776 mg twice daily orally for 14 days in addition to standard care and starting 48-96 hours after symptom onset, reduces the mean duration of symptoms from about 8 days to 7 days, when compared with placebo ( 109899 ). A small open-label study in adults with confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19 shows that taking ginger 1000 mg and ashwagandha 500 mg twice daily for 15 days, along with conventional therapy, leads to a 13.8-fold and 2.6-fold increase in the relative rate of clinical cure at 7 days and 15 days, respectively, when compared with conventional therapy alone. Taking this combination also appears to reduce time to recovery by around 6 days but does not improve the rate of negative COVID-19 tests, chest imaging findings, viral clearance, serum antibodies, or other measures of disease progression when compared with conventional therapy alone ( 112094 ). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of blinding, and the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, ashwagandha, or the combination. more Diabetes. Some preliminary clinical studies suggest that oral ginger might have a small beneficial effect on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes. Meta-analyses of several small clinical trials in adults with type 2 diabetes show that taking ginger 1200-3000 mg daily for 8-13 weeks reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by around 0.6% to 1% and fasting blood glucose by 19-21 mg/dL when compared with placebo ( 96680 , 107898 ). However, a recent meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking ginger 1200-2000 mg daily for 4-12 weeks does not improve HbA1c or fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo ( 114780 ). The reasons for these discordant results are not entirely clear, but they are likely related to heterogeneity of the included populations, treatment dose, and duration of follow up. Additionally, a small clinical study in adults with diabetes on hemodialysis for end stage renal disease shows that taking ginger powder 2000 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose and measures of insulin resistance, but not serum insulin levels, when compared with placebo ( 111543 ). In patients with gestational diabetes at weeks 24-28 of pregnancy, clinical research shows that taking ginger 1500 mg daily in three divided doses for 6 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and measures of insulin resistance by a small amount when compared with placebo, with no effect on postprandial glucose levels ( 103358 ). more Diabetic neuropathy. Topical ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical trial in adults treated with gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy of the foot shows that applying a combination balm containing ginger, menthol, camphor, and other ingredients three times a day for 4 weeks moderately improves pain scores when compared with a placebo balm without ginger but containing menthol, camphor, and other ingredients.( 114781 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. more Diarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for various types of diarrhea, including cholera and acute bacterial dysentery, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for these conditions. Dry mouth. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with ginger extract is beneficial for dry mouth. In patients with dry mouth related to type 2 diabetes, clinical research shows that use of a ginger extract 25% mouthwash 20 mL three times daily for 14 days modestly reduces symptoms of dry mouth when compared with rinsing with a saline control mouthwash ( 106068 ). Although this study was indicated as being triple-blind, it is unclear how the taste of ginger was masked. more Dyspepsia. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for dyspepsia. In patients with dyspepsia, a small clinical trial shows that a single dose of ginger root powder 1.2 grams, taken 1 hour prior to eating, does not reduce abdominal discomfort when compared with placebo. However, it increases the rate of gastric emptying ( 20325 ). more Erectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for erectile dysfunction. Preliminary clinical research in middle-aged males with ED shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product (Revactin, MD Concepts LLC) containing ginger root 250 mg, muira puama 250 mg, guarana 250 mg, and L-citrulline 800 mg twice daily for 3 months improves scores related to erectile function and intercourse satisfaction, but does not improve sexual desire or orgasmic function scores, when compared to baseline ( 103224 ). This study is limited by the lack of a placebo control, the use of per-protocol analysis, and a high dropout rate. In fact, 44% of patients withdrew in order to resume use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. Further, it is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. more Hangover. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for managing symptoms of hangover. Preliminary clinical research shows that use of a decoction containing a combination of ginger 6 grams, pith of Citrus tangerine 3 grams, and brown sugar decreases symptoms of alcohol hangovers, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, when compared with placebo. The decoction was taken once 5 hours prior to drinking alcohol or four times after drinking alcohol ( 20320 ). more Hyperlipidemia. Oral ginger may be modestly beneficial for some patients with hyperlipidemia. A meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research in adults with and without hyperlipidemia shows that taking ginger 200-3000 mg orally daily for 2-24 weeks reduces triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 12 mg/dL and 5 mg/dL, respectively, and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 1 mg/dL when compared with placebo ( 109521 ). However, the validity of this study is limited by high heterogeneity. A clinical study in adults with hyperlipidemia shows that taking ginger powder 1 gram three times daily for 45 days reduces triglyceride and cholesterol levels by an additional 36% and 90%, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 20327 ). more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for lowering blood pressure. A preliminary clinical study in patients with diabetes and elevated systolic blood pressure shows that drinking black tea containing ginger 3 grams three times daily for 8 weeks does not reduce blood pressure by a clinically significant amount when compared with plain black tea ( 96669 ). more Hypothyroidism. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial in patients with hypothyroidism. A small clinical study in patients with primary hypothyroidism who are stabilized on thyroid hormone therapy shows that taking ginger powder 500 mg twice daily for 30 days improves symptoms associated with hypothyroidism, including cold intolerance, constipation, dizziness, dry skin, weight gain, and concentration and memory issues, when compared with placebo. However, ginger supplementation does not seem to improve hair loss, hearing, nail fragility, speech, or feelings of depression in these patients ( 107903 ). more Insect bite. It is unclear if topical ginger is beneficial for reducing the size of insect bites. Preliminary clinical research shows that a topical application of Trikatu, which contains ginger, long pepper, and black pepper extracts with 0.074% piperine and 0.046% gingerol, does not reduce the papule size associated with mosquito bites when compared with a control compound containing the same base ingredients of camphor 2%, menthol 2%, and eucalyptus oil 4% ( 89893 ). more Intraoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for preventing IONV. Clinical research in individuals undergoing elective C-section and receiving cimetidine and metoclopramide, shows that taking ginger 1 gram orally 30 minutes prior to anesthesia reduces the number of episodes of intraoperative nausea, but not vomiting, when compared with placebo ( 89890 ). In other clinical research in adults undergoing elective surgical procedures, adding ginger to a high calorie drink consumed pre-operatively reduces the incidence of nausea from 40% to 10%, and the incidence of vomiting from 25% to 10% when compared with the high calorie drink alone ( 110007 ). The validity of these results is unclear as only patients were blinded to the treatment group. more Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral ginger might reduce symptoms of IBS when used in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical trial shows that taking ginger 1-2 grams daily for 28 days does not improve symptoms or the number of responders when compared with placebo ( 90102 ). However, some research shows that ginger might be beneficial in some patients when used along with other herbal ingredients. Taking a capsule containing ginger, boswellia, and yarrow three times daily for 30 days reduces the frequency and severity of abdominal pain, as well as the severity of bloating, when compared with placebo in females, but not males, with mild to moderate IBS ( 96673 ). Another clinical study shows that taking an herbal mixture containing ginger, English horsemint, and purple nut sedge tuber three times daily for 8 weeks improves IBS symptoms including abdominal pain, stool frequency, stool consistency, incomplete evacuation, and urgency, when compared to baseline; these improvements are similar to those achieved by taking mebeverine 135 mg three times daily ( 89900 ). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. more Joint pain. Oral ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product (Instaflex Joint Support, Direct Digital) containing glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg, methylsufonlylmethane 500 mg, white willow bark extract 250 mg, ginger root concentrate 50 mg, Boswellia extract 125 mg, turmeric root extract 50 mg, cayenne 40 m H.U. 50 mg, and hyaluronic acid 4 mg in three divided doses daily for 8 weeks reduces joint pain severity by 37% compared to only 16% with placebo. However, it does not improve joint stiffness or function when compared with placebo ( 89560 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. more Menopausal symptoms. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for menopausal symptoms such as insomnia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this purpose. Menorrhagia. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for menorrhagia. Preliminary clinical research in healthy adults experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding shows that taking ginger 250 mg three times daily for 4 days, starting the day prior to menstruation, and repeating for three menstrual cycles, reduces the amount of menstrual bleeding when compared with placebo ( 96672 ). more Migraine headache. Small clinical studies suggest that oral ginger may modestly reduce migraine pain severity and duration. However, taking ginger doesn't seem to PREVENT migraines. Ginger does not seem to be effective for the prevention of migraines. Clinical research in patients with episodic migraine shows that taking ginger extract 200 mg three times daily for 3 months does not reduce the number of migraine attacks, the use of analgesics, or the number of days with pain, any more than taking placebo ( 101761 ). However, ginger may be beneficial for the treatment of migraine. Clinical research shows that taking ginger extract 400 mg orally in the emergency room along with intravenous ketoprofen 100 mg reduces pain over the next 2 hours when compared with ketoprofen and placebo. This combination also resulted in an overall better response with a higher likelihood of having no or mild pain with treatment ( 101762 ). Taking ginger 250 mg at the onset of a common migraine headache seems to be as effective as taking sumatriptan 50 mg for reducing headache severity within two hours of treatment ( 89894 ). Furthermore, a combination of ginger and feverfew (GelStat Migraine, GelStat Corporation; LipiGesic M, PuraMed BioScience), administered sublingually at the onset of a migraine attack, decreases the duration and intensity of migraine pain when compared with placebo ( 19357 , 22602 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, feverfew, or the combination. Feverfew alone has demonstrated some benefit in treating migraines. more Multiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for MS. A small clinical study in adults with MS shows that taking ginger 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks reduces disability scores and improves physical and psychological quality of life scores when compared with placebo ( 111541 ). Another small clinical study in adults with relapsing-remitting MS shows that taking ginger 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks reduces the frequency and severity of nausea and constipation and the severity but not frequency of bloating when compared with placebo. However, no improvement was noted in other gastrointestinal symptoms of MS including abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea, dysphagia, gas, or heartburn ( 113614 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for NAFLD. A small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking ginger 1000 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves liver steatosis scores but not liver fibrosis scores when compared with placebo. Ginger also modestly improves levels of alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase but not aspartate aminotransferase ( 113615 ). However, it is unclear whether any improvements are clinically significant. Another small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking ginger root 1500 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and fasting blood glucose levels, but does not affect triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, insulin resistance, blood pressure, or fatty liver index, when compared with placebo ( 102465 ). more Obesity. Oral ginger has primarily been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Although some individual research disagrees ( 40802 ), a meta-analysis and most individual clinical trials show that taking ginger alone or with other ingredients does not reduce weight by a clinically significant amount when compared with placebo in overweight or obese individuals ( 20346 , 20347 , 96676 , 109521 ). Ginger has been taken alone or in combination with green tea and capsaicin; rhubarb, astragalus, red sage, turmeric, and gallic acid (Number Ten); or raspberry ketone (Razberi K, Integrity Nutraceuticals), caffeine, capsicum extract (Capsimax, OmniActive Health Technologies), bitter orange fruit (Advantra Z, Nutratech Inc), L-theanine, and black pepper fruit extract (Biperine, Sabinsa Corporation) (Prograde Metabolism) ( 20346 , 20347 , 40802 , 96676 ). Due to the various other ingredients contained in available formulations, any effect from ginger is unclear. more Oral mucositis. Topical ginger, as a mouthwash, has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in patients undergoing chemotherapy shows that using 10 mL of a mouthwash containing ginger for 14 days does not improve oral mucositis severity or pain when compared with saline, although a modest improvement in severity was noted after 7 days of treatment with the ginger containing mouthwash. The mouthwash contained ginger 4% and honey 7% and was used for 2 minutes 3 times daily ( 116439 ). The interpretation of these results is limited by the low overall mucositis severity reported during the study. Also, it is unclear if any effect is due to ginger, honey, or the combination. more Parturition. It is unclear if bathing in a ginger bath is beneficial for shortening the duration of labor. Preliminary clinical research shows that bathing in 228 liters of water containing 4 drops of ginger essential oil does not shorten the duration of labor when compared with a regular bath ( 20345 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for females with PCOS. Preliminary clinical research in females with PCOS shows that taking ginger 500 mg three times daily orally for 8 weeks decreases body weight, body mass index, and levels of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, when compared with placebo. It does not affect testosterone levels ( 110006 ). more Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Evidence for the use of oral ginger for preventing PONV is inconclusive and conflicting. Reasons for the conflicting findings may relate to the ginger formulation used and the outcomes measured. It is unclear if ginger aromatherapy is beneficial for PONV. Some individual clinical studies, as well as a large, recent meta-analysis of the available clinical research, show that taking ginger by mouth 1 hour prior to surgery does not reduce the incidence of 24-hour PONV ( 3452 , 3453 , 17369 , 99445 ). Also, the meta-analysis found that, although ginger reduces the severity of PONV when measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), it does not reduce the severity of PONV when measured on a verbal descriptive scale (VDS). Furthermore, ginger does not reduce the use of rescue antiemetic medications ( 99445 ). However, some small, individual clinical studies and a meta-analysis of older clinical research show that taking ginger by mouth prior to surgery reduces the incidence of 24-hour PONV by up to 16% to 38% ( 722 , 723 , 1919 , 13237 , 20336 , 20338 , 20339 ). In addition, large clinical trials show that the frequency and severity of PONV 2-6 hours after surgery are similar when ginger 1 gram is given orally or when medications such as metoclopramide or dexmedetomidine are given intravenously prior to undergoing anesthesia ( 103356 , 103360 ). However, taking ginger prior to general anesthesia, in combination with other antiemetics like dexamethasone or cimetidine and metoclopramide, does not seem to reduce nausea and vomiting when compared with the other medications alone ( 20337 , 89890 ). In contrast, other research shows that powdered ginger 1-2 grams 30-60 minutes before induction of anesthesia has been used in most studies showing benefit, occasionally followed by 1 gram of ginger administered two hours after surgery ( 722 , 723 , 13237 , 20336 , 20338 , 103356 , 103360 ). Ginger aromatherapy has also been evaluated for the prevention of PONV. Application of 5% ginger essential oil to the wrists of patients prior to the induction of general anesthesia seems to prevent PONV in approximately 80% of treated patients ( 20334 ). Also, use of ginger essential oil aromatherapy on a gauze pad results in nausea relief in approximately 67% of patients compared with 40% in the placebo group; however, a blend of essential oils including ginger, spearmint, peppermint, and cardamom, results in nausea relief in 82% of patients ( 89888 ).These conflicting findings may be due to differences in outcome measures and the chemical compositions of ginger preparations used in the various clinical studies. Some evidence suggests that the efficacy of ginger for preventing PONV differs based on the formulation used. A network meta-analysis of 18 studies evaluating various ginger preparations, including ginger oil, ginger powder, ginger extract, and a combination of ginger powder and antiemetics, for the prevention of PONV suggests that ginger powder and ginger oil are the most effective formulations for preventing nausea and vomiting, respectively. The analysis also shows that while no ginger formulation is superior to another for the prevention of nausea, ginger powder and ginger oil have a lower risk of postoperative vomiting when compared with ginger extract. A subgroup analysis suggests that ginger seems to be most effective in adults over 30 years of age, when administered preoperatively, and when used for gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, obstetric, or ophthalmic surgeries ( 112108 ). more Postoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for postoperative recovery. One preliminary clinical study in adults who had a tonsillectomy shows that taking a specific ginger supplement (Solgar, Leonia) 500 mg twice daily for 7 days along with acetaminophen and antibiotics modestly improves pain and wound healing when compared with acetaminophen and antibiotics alone ( 96674 ). more Postpartum complications. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial in patients with postpartum pain. A small clinical study in patients recovering from vaginal delivery shows that taking ginger powder 500 mg 8-hours post-delivery, followed by 250 mg every 8 hours thereafter for 24 hours, reduces postpartum pain by nearly 1 point on a 10-point rating scale when compared with placebo ( 107904 ). It is unclear if this improvement would be considered clinically relevant. more Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial in patients with radiation-induced nausea and vomiting. A very small study in adults with cervical cancer undergoing treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy shows that taking ginger 250-500 mg twice daily for 6 weeks in addition to standard antiemetic therapy does not reduce acute or delayed nausea and vomiting when compared with antiemetic therapy alone ( 113616 ). more Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). One small clinical study suggests that oral ginger may improve some symptoms of RA. Preliminary clinical research in adults with RA shows that taking ginger powder 1500 mg daily for 12 weeks improves disease activity on the Disease Activity Score-28 when compared with placebo ( 100697 ). Another small study in adults with RA shows that taking a combination product containing ginger, ashwagandha, black pepper, and colchicum luteum twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve RA disease scores when compared with celecoxib 100 mg orally twice daily ( 114785 ). However, the interpretation of these results is limited by. poor methodology, and the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Smoking cessation. Oral ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults in India with a history of smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily for at least 3 years shows that taking a specific combination product containing ginger 50 mg, ashwagandha, cowhage, turmeric and other herbal extracts (Smotect, Smotect India) twice daily for 3 months reduces the number of cigarettes smoked by approximately 3 per day when compared with placebo. This product also reduces levels of alveolar carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin but does not improve lung capacity ( 112115 ). However, only data from patients who completed treatment were analyzed, which limits the validity of this study. It is also unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. more Swallowing dysfunction. The effects of oral ginger for treating swallowing dysfunction are inconclusive. Reasons for the conflicting findings may relate to the route of administration or the number of treatments provided. Clinical research shows that applying a spray containing ginger and clematix root (Tongyan) to the oropharynx for 28 days is more effective than placebo at treating grade 2 or 3 dysphagia in stroke victims. However, there does not seem to be a beneficial effect in patients with grade 1 dysphagia ( 20342 ). Other clinical research in elderly patients with dysphagia shows that taking a single dose of ginger 2 mg orally does not improve swallowing but increases saliva ( 96671 ). It is possible that a single dose of ginger is not enough to improve swallowing function. more Toxin-induced liver damage. Oral ginger might help to prevent liver damage in patients using antimycobacterial drugs. Preliminary clinical research shows that a specific ginger supplement (Zintoma, Goldaru) 500 mg taken 30 minutes prior to antimycobacterial drugs daily for 4 weeks reduces the percentage of patients experiencing an increase in liver function enzymes to greater than five times the upper limit of normal by 54% when compared with placebo. Antimycobacterial drugs used for tuberculosis in the study included isoniazid 5 mg/kg, rifampin 10 mg/kg, ethambutol 15 mg/kg, and pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg daily ( 96670 ). more Traumatic brain injury (TBI). Oral ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary research in young adults with subjective memory dysfunction associated with mild TBI, shows that taking a combination of ginger 36 mg and boswellia 360 mg (Memoral) every 8 hours orally for one month improves scores for some, but not all, parameters on an auditory-visual learning test performed at one and three months, when compared with placebo. Total learning scores increased by about 7.5 points with the ginger combination product, compared with 4 points for placebo ( 110132 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, boswellia, or the combination. more Ulcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for improving symptoms of ulcerative colitis. Preliminary clinical research in adults with ulcerative colitis shows that taking ginger powder 1000 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves disease activity as measured by the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index Questionnaire when compared with taking placebo. However, taking ginger did not improve quality of life, stool frequency, bowel distress, or flatulence when compared with placebo ( 100694 ). It is possible that this study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in these secondary outcomes. more Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for various upper respiratory tract infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition. Vertigo. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for improving symptoms of vertigo. A small clinical study shows that taking 1 gram of ginger orally as a single dose prior to stimulated vertigo seems to reduce symptoms of vertigo, including nausea, when compared with placebo. However, it does not seem to reduce nystagmus ( 7623 ). more Gastroenteritis-associated nausea and vomiting . It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for children with gastroenteritis-associated vomiting. In children aged 1-10 years with acute gastroenteritis-associated vomiting, clinical research shows that taking a single dose of ginger reduces the risk of vomiting at least once in the subsequent 8 hours by 20% when compared with placebo. The incidence of vomiting over the next 24 and 48 hours was also modestly reduced. The children were given 20 drops of ginger equivalent to 10 mg immediately, followed by every 8 hours until cessation of vomiting. All children were offered hypotonic oral rehydration solution (ORS) 30 minutes after the first dose ( 106076 ). The number of children accepting ORS, and the quantity of ORS consumed, was less in the group receiving placebo. It is unclear if this affected the outcomes of this study. Also, the incidence or severity of nausea was not investigated. more More evidence is needed to rate ginger for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Ginger has been safely used in multiple clinical trials ( 721 , 722 , 723 , 5343 , 7048 , 7084 , 7085 , 7400 , 7623 , 11346 )( 12472 , 13080 , 13237 , 13244 , 17369 , 17928 , 17929 , 89889 , 89890 , 89894 )( 89895 , 89898 , 89899 , 90102 , 96252 , 96253 , 96259 , 96260 , 96669 ) ( 101760 , 101761 , 101762 , 103359 , 107903 ). Possibly Safe when used topically and appropriately, short-term ( 89893 , 89897 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when consumed in the amounts typically found in foods. CHILDREN: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Ginger powder has been used with apparent safety at a dose of up to 750 mg daily for 4 days in girls aged 14-18 years ( 96255 ). PREGNANCY: Likely Safe when consumed in the amounts typically found in foods. Ginger is considered a first-line nonpharmacological treatment option for nausea in pregnancy by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) ( 111601 ). However, it should not be used long-term or without medical supervision and close monitoring. PREGNANCY: Possibly Safe when used for medicinal purposes. Despite some early reports of adverse effects ( 721 , 7083 ) and one observational study suggesting that taking dried ginger and other herbal supplements during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy marginally increased the chance of stillbirth ( 96254 ), most research shows that ginger is unlikely to cause harm to the baby. The risk for major malformations in infants of parents who took ginger when pregnant does not appear to be higher than the baseline rate of 1% to 3% ( 721 , 1922 , 5343 , 11346 , 13071 , 13080 , 96254 ). Also, other research suggests that ginger intake during various trimesters does not significantly affect the risk of spontaneous abortion, congenital malformations, stillbirth, perinatal death, preterm birth, low birth weight, or low Apgar scores ( 18211 , 90103 ). Ginger use has been associated with an increase in non-severe vaginal bleeding, including spotting, after week 17 of pregnancy ( 18211 ). LACTATION: Likely Safe when consumed in the amounts typically found in foods. There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of ginger when used for medicinal purposes; avoid amounts greater than those found in foods.</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: Ginger is typically used in doses of 0.5-3 grams daily for up to 12 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Ginger extract is sometimes standardized to gingerols, zingerone, and shogaol content. Concentrations of gingerols have ranged from 4.3% to 5% ( 17933 , 17934 , 101761 , 101762 ). Topical: Ginger has been used in various topical formulations, including as a mouthwash, gel, ointment, and massage oil. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.

Children Oral: Ginger has been used in doses of 0.75 to 2 grams daily for 3-4 days. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization &amp; Formulation In clinical trials, ginger has been provided in syrup, biscuits, tablets, capsules, and teas as fresh root, dried root, or liquid extract ( 90103 , 91201 ). An analysis of ten ginger supplements shows that the gingerol composition can range from 0 to 9.43 mg/gram, with 6-shogaol levels ranging from 0.16 to 2.18 mg/gram, 8-gingerol levels ranging from 0.00 to 1.1 mg/gram, and 10-gingerol levels ranging from 0.00 to 1.40 mg/gram ( 51934 ). Various standardized products have been used in clinical trials. In one clinical trial, each ginger capsule contained liquid ginger root extract that was considered equivalent to 250 mg of ginger root (Aphios Corporation) and provided 8.5 mg of combined gingerols, zingerone, and shogaol ( 20316 ). Raw ginger capsules (Hawkins Pharmaceutical Group) have been standardized to contain 4.3% gingerols composed specifically of 6-gingerol 4.1 mg/gram, 8-gingerol 1.3 mg/gram, 10-gingerol 1.9 mg/gram, and 6-shogaol 2.2 mg/gram ( 17933 , 17934 ). Heat-treated ginger capsules have been standardized to contain 6-gingerol 2.8 mg/gram, 8-gingerol 1.0 mg/gram, 10-gingerol 1.6 mg/gram, and 6-shogaol 2.6 mg/gram ( 17933 ). Ginger extract standardized to 5% gingerols has been used ( 101761 , 101762 ). Other ginger capsules used in clinical research have been standardized to contain 2.29 mg/gram of gingerols and 6-shogaols ( 90102 ).

Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Ginger may have antiplatelet effects and may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. However, research is conflicting. Laboratory research suggests that ginger inhibits thromboxane synthetase and decreases platelet aggregation ( 7622 , 12634 , 20321 , 20322 , 20323 , 96257 ). However, this has not been demonstrated unequivocally in humans, with mixed results from clinical trials ( 96257 ).

Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, when taken prior to cyclosporine, ginger might decrease cyclosporine levels. In an animal model, ginger juice taken 2 hours prior to cyclosporine administration reduced the maximum concentration and area under the curve of cyclosporine by 51% and 40%, respectively. This effect was not observed when ginger juice and cyclosporine were administered at the same time ( 20401 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination.

Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Ginger might increase or decrease the levels of CYP3A4 substrates. In vitro research and some case reports suggest that ginger inhibits CYP3A4 activity ( 111544 , 111644 ). Three case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describe increased toxicity in patients taking ginger and cancer medications that are CYP3A4 substrates (imatinib, dabrafenib, and crizotinib). However, the causality of this interaction is unclear due to the presence of multiple interacting drugs and routes of administration ( 111644 ). Conversely, other in vitro research suggests that ginger induces CYP3A4 activity, leading to reduced levels of CYP3A4 substrates ( 111404 ). However, this interaction has not been reported in humans. more LOSARTAN (Cozaar) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, ginger might increase levels of losartan and the risk of hypotension. In animal research, ginger increased the levels and hypotensive effects of a single dose of losartan ( 102459 ). It is not clear if ginger alters the concentration or effects of losartan when taken continuously. Additionally, this interaction has not been shown in humans. more METRONIDAZOLE (Flagyl) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, ginger might increase levels of metronidazole. In an animal model, ginger increased the absorption and plasma half-life of metronidazole. In addition, the elimination rate and clearance of metronidazole was significantly reduced ( 20350 ). more NIFEDIPINE (Procardia) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Ginger may have antiplatelet effects and increase the risk of bleeding if used with nifedipine.

Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Ginger might increase the absorption and blood levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates. In vitro research and case reports suggest that ginger inhibits drug efflux by P-gp, potentially increasing absorption and serum levels of P-gp substrates ( 111544 , 111644 ). Two case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describe increased toxicity in patients taking ginger and cancer medications that are P-gp substrates (trametinib, crizotinib). However, the causality of this interaction is unclear due to the presence of multiple interacting drugs and routes of administration ( 111644 ). more PHENPROCOUMON (Marcoumar, others) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Ginger might increase the risk of bleeding with phenprocoumon. Phenprocoumon, a warfarin-related anticoagulant, might increase the international normalized ratio (INR) when taken with ginger. There is one case report of a 76-year-old woman with a stable INR on phenprocoumon that increased to greater than 10 when she began consuming dried ginger and ginger tea ( 12880 ). more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Ginger might increase the risk of bleeding with warfarin. Laboratory research suggests that ginger might inhibit thromboxane synthetase and decrease platelet aggregation ( 7622 , 12634 , 20321 , 20322 , 20323 ). In one case report, ginger increased the INR when taken with phenprocoumon, which has similar pharmacological effects as warfarin ( 12880 ). In another case report, ginger increased the INR when taken with a combination of warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, and acetaminophen ( 20349 ). A longitudinal analysis suggests that taking ginger increases the risk of bleeding in patients taking warfarin for at least 4 months ( 20348 ). However, research in healthy people suggests that ginger has no effect on INR, or the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin ( 12881 , 15176 ).

Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, glucomannan may decrease absorption of drugs taken orally. Due to its viscosity and bulking effects, there is concern that glucomannan can decrease the absorption of oral drugs. A small clinical study in healthy volunteers shows that taking glyburide 2.5 mg plus glucomannan 3.9 grams with breakfast reduces plasma levels of glyburide when compared with breakfast and glyburide alone ( 11360 ). In addition, animal research demonstrates this effect on amoxicillin, but shows increased absorption of metronidazole. This mouse model also demonstrates that metronidazole elimination is prolonged, but amoxicillin elimination is enhanced by 38%; glucomannan may also affect the distribution of some drugs ( 112703 ). To avoid changes in absorption, take glucomannan 30-60 minutes after taking oral drugs. more</data><data key="mechanism_text">General Glucomannan is a high-molecular weight, water-soluble, non-digestible polysaccharide composed of D-glucose and D-mannose units connected by beta ( 1 , 4 )-glycosidic bonds ( 11361 , 57774 , 106411 ). It is found in many plants, yeast, and fungi; however, glucomannan dietary supplements are usually derived from konjac (Amorphophallus konjac) tubers ( 11361 ). Compared to other dietary fibers including wheat bran, psyllium, prickly pear cactus, and others, glucomannan has the highest proportion of soluble fiber ( 57814 ). Antidiabetic effects It is thought that glucomannan may work to improve glycemic control by slowing gastric emptying and increasing the viscosity of gastrointestinal contents ( 11361 , 57774 ). Gastrointestinal effects Glucomannan is a water-soluble, non-digestible carbohydrate that functions as a bulk-forming laxative and increases water absorption by the stools ( 11294 , 11295 , 57783 , 57774 ). Clinical research shows that glucomannan can reduce mouth-to-cecum transit time ( 57802 ). Immunomodulatory effects Animal research shows that dietary glucomannan may prevent the development or exacerbation of eczema by modulating autoimmune function ( 57778 , 57788 ). Lipid effects Glucomannan is thought to exert its hypolipidemic effects by enhancing fecal excretion of cholesterol and bile acids and by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis ( 11357 , 57774 , 111223 ). Some clinical evidence also suggests that glucomannan might reduce triglycerides by increasing levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1), which work in tandem to hydrolyze triglycerides and deliver lipid nutrients to target tissues ( 111223 ). Ultraviolet protective effects In vitro, glucomannan isolated from Candida utilis had photoprotective effects on human keratinocytes, suppressing UVB-induced apoptosis and preventing the decrease in viability of the cells ( 57792 ). It is not known if glucomannan isolated from konjac has the same protective effects. Weight loss effects Glucomannan might exert beneficial effects on weight by promoting satiety and fecal energy loss ( 57780 , 57774 ). Additionally, glucomannan, a soluble fiber, slows carbohydrate absorption which might improve weight loss ( 57776 ). It also increases satiety because it increases in size in the presence of liquids. Also, in human research, four weeks of "chewing training," using a food made with glucomannan that increases the number of chewing strokes and chewing time to swallowing, was found to increase maximal biting force and chewing performance ( 57803 ). It is possible that increased chewing time may play a role in the weight loss effects of glucomannan. In human research, increased thermogenesis did not appear to play a role in the weight loss effect ( 57808 )</data><data key="general_safety">Likely Safe</data><data key="overview_text">Glucomannan is a high molecular weight polysaccharide which is an indigestible soluble fiber. It is usually obtained from the tubers of the konjac plant (Amorphophallus konjac), but other plant sources are sometimes used. It has been used as a food and medicine in various Asian cultures for more than a thousand years. It is used as an emulsifier and thickener in food, having a high viscosity and the ability to absorb up to 100 times its weight in water. In 2020, it was added to the list of dietary fibers that can be declared on Nutrition and Supplement Facts labels in the US.</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Constipation. Glucomannan is generally effective for treatment of constipation in adults, but the efficacy in children is less clear. Clinical research in adults shows that taking glucomannan 1-1.5 grams three times daily orally for 3-5 weeks, sometimes followed by 1 gram twice daily for an additional 4 weeks, can relieve constipation. As a nonabsorbable dietary fiber, glucomannan appears to have a bulk laxative effect ( 11294 , 57783 , 57795 , 57816 ). Taking glucomannan 1.45 grams with lactulose 4.2 grams twice daily orally for 1-3 months appears to relieve constipation during pregnancy ( 57818 ). In children with constipation, glucomannan can increase the frequency of bowel movements but does not seem to improve stool consistency. A meta-analysis of 3 clinical trials including 122 children with functional constipation shows that glucomannan leads to 1.4 more stools per week but does not improve stool consistency when compared with placebo or a maltodextrin control ( 97935 ). Two studies included in this analysis show that taking a specific glucomannan supplement (Dicoplus, Dicofarm) 100 mg/kg once or twice daily (maximum daily dose 5 grams) along with fluids for up to 12 weeks relieves constipation in children ( 11295 , 57775 ). However, the other clinical study included in the analysis shows that taking a different glucomannan supplement (Dicoman Junior, Vitis Pharma) 1.26 grams twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve constipation in children ( 92005 ). more Diabetes. Limited clinical research suggests that glucomannan may improve glycemic control and lipid profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes. Taking glucomannan orally seems to reduce serum cholesterol and blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 183 , 11357 , 11359 , 57791 , 57797 , 57798 , 112702 ). Most clinical research shows that a glucomannan dose of 3-15 grams daily for 4-12 weeks may reduce fasting blood glucose ( 183 , 11357 , 57791 , 57797 , 111225 ). Eating cookies containing glucomannan 0.5-0.7 grams per 100 kcal for 3 weeks has also been used ( 11358 , 11359 , 57797 ). Accordingly, a meta-analysis of 5 mostly small, low-quality clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes, that includes several of these studies, shows that taking glucomannan 1.2-15 grams daily for 4-16 weeks modestly improves fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo or wheat bran. This analysis also shows that taking glucomannan modestly improves 2-hour post-prandial glucose, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels but not triglycerides ( 112702 ). In healthy people, adding a specific glucomannan supplement (PolyGlycopleX, InovoBiologic Inc.) as granules, 2.5-7.5 grams before meals, or as capsules 3-6 grams with meals, can reduce the glycemic index of starchy foods ( 92003 , 92007 ). Also, taking this glucomannan product reduces postprandial glucose in a dose-dependent fashion in healthy people ( 92002 , 92007 ). However, the interpretation of this evidence is limited by low-quality research and variations in dosages and formulations. more Hyperlipidemia. Most clinical research shows that glucomannan can reduce cholesterol levels in healthy people and those with hyperlipidemia. Although some conflicting evidence exists ( 57794 ), most research shows that taking glucomannan orally can improve lipid levels in healthy adults, children and adults with hyperlipidemia, and adults with diabetes ( 178 , 11357 , 11358 , 11359 , 57779 , 57781 , 57784 , 57791 , 57799 , 97936 )( 112702). Meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking glucomannan 2.5-15.1 grams daily for up to 12 weeks can reduce total cholesterol by 19 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 13-16 mg/dL, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 12 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 11 mg/dL when compared with a control ( 57797 , 97936 ). Clinical research has not demonstrated a dose-response relationship, and the most common glucomannan doses are 5-10 grams daily for up to 6 weeks for adults and 2-3 grams daily in divided doses for up to 8 weeks for children ( 11358 , 11359 , 57797 , 97936 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Dumping syndrome. It is unclear if oral glucomannan is beneficial in patients with dumping syndrome. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking glucomannan (Propol, Pharmacia) 2.6 or 5.2 grams as a single dose reduces the incidence of reactive hypoglycemia following an oral glucose load in adult patients with previous gastric surgery ( 57805 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking glucomannan improves glucose tolerance, but not glucose absorption, in children experiencing gastric dumping syndrome after gastric surgery ( 57804 ). more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral glucomannan is beneficial in patients with hypertension. Preliminary clinical research in patients with hypertension shows that eating cookies containing 0.7 grams of glucomannan per 100 kcal, for a total dose of up to 13 grams of glucomannan daily for 3 weeks, can lower systolic blood pressure by about 7% when compared with placebo ( 11359 ). more Hyperthyroidism. It is unclear if oral glucomannan is beneficial in patients with hyperthyroidism. Preliminary clinical research in patients with hyperthyroidism shows that taking glucomannan 1.3 grams twice daily orally, plus methimazole and propranolol for 2 months, reduces serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels during the first few weeks of therapy, when compared with methimazole and propranolol alone. However, these effects seem to diminish after 6 weeks of therapy ( 57793 ). more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral glucomannan is beneficial for metabolic syndrome. A small crossover study in adults with metabolic syndrome, defined as impaired glucose tolerance, reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, elevated serum triglycerides, and moderate hypertension, shows that consuming biscuits containing glucomannan 0.5 grams per 100 kcal (equivalent to approximately 8-13 grams/day) daily for 3 weeks may modestly improve fasting glucose, but does not improve blood pressure or levels of triglycerides or HDL cholesterol when compared with wheat bran biscuits ( 11358 ). However, the 2-week washout period between interventions may be too short to detect differences in some outcomes. more Obesity. Although some low-quality research shows that oral glucomannan is beneficial for achieving slight improvements in body weight, other research does not support this. Meta-analyses of clinical research on the use of glucomannan for improving body weight and body composition in adults and children with overweight or obesity show mixed results, with one analysis suggesting that taking glucomannan reduces body weight by around 0.8 kg when compared with placebo ( 57797 ), and another showing no improvement in body weight ( 92014 ). Reasons for these discrepant findings are not clear, but the discrepancies may relate to differences in the study populations and dosing and duration of glucomannan treatment, as well as the low methodological quality of many studies conducted to date. Similar to the pooled analyses described above, individual clinical study results are also mixed. Several small clinical studies show that taking glucomannan can improve body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, and other measures of body composition in children and adults with overweight or obesity, usually when used in combination with a calorie-restricted diet ( 180 , 181 , 182 , 183 , 54240 , 92008 , 92010 , 92011 , 111224 , 112701 ). However, conflicting evidence exists ( 179 , 57784 , 57790 , 57796 , 92009 , 112430 ). Doses that have been used with positive outcomes in adults are 3-4 grams daily, taken in divided doses, for up to 3 months ( 181 , 182 , 183 , 92008 , 112701 ). In children, doses were 2-3 grams daily for 4 months ( 180 ). Specific products evaluated include Propylene TM (Natural Alternatives International), PolyGlycopleX (InovoBiologic, Inc.) 3-5 grams 2-3 times daily for 15 weeks, and. Chrombalance 338 mg before each meal and 226 mg in the afternoon daily for 5 weeks ( 54240 , 92010 , 92011 ). more More evidence is needed to rate glucomannan for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally as food ( 11358 , 11359 ). Glucomannan powder or flour is often used to enrich noodles in traditional Japanese foods. Possibly Safe when used orally with at least 250 mL (8 ounces) of water or other fluid. Glucomannan has been safely used in studies lasting up to 4 months ( 178 , 179 , 181 , 182 , 11046 , 11294 , 11357 , 11294 , 54240 , 57775 )( 57781 , 57783 , 57784 , 92004 , 92008 , 92009 , 92010 , 92011 , 106410 ).

Green tea is different than black and oolong teas because it is not fermented. Black tea is fully fermented, and oolong tea is partially fermented. Green tea is produced by steaming fresh leaves at high temperatures. This process inactivates certain oxidizing enzymes, but doesn't decrease polyphenols. Polyphenols such as flavanols, flavandiols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids are abundant in green tea. Flavanols, including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epicatechin (EC), are all referred to as catechins. These seem to be responsible for many of the proposed benefits of green tea. EGCG makes up 50% to 60% of green tea catechins ( 6031 , 8118 , 11310 , 90170 , 90172 , 102721 ). Flavonoids include kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin ( 90170 ). The amount of polyphenols and catechins in green tea is affected by growing conditions, leaf age, and storage during and after transport. Catechins in green tea range from 69 to 103 mg/gram of tea ( 14129 , 14130 ). Green tea also contains phytoestrogens, including beta-sitosterol and the lignan precursors matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol, as well as xanthenes ( 13190 , 90170 ). Green tea also contains 2% to 4% caffeine ( 519 ) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup ( 4218 ). Another constituent of green tea leaves is the amino acid, L-theanine ( 90170 , 90189 ). Unlike fermented teas such as black and oolong teas, green tea does not contain theaflavins, pigments that are produced during the fermentation process ( 15656 ). Anti-acne effects In clinical research, topical application of green tea extract has been shown to have anti-acne effects. Possible mechanisms of action include antimicrobial effects against Propionibacterium acnes, as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of its constituents ( 104609 ). Anti-arthritis effects Although evidence in humans is lacking, EGCG and other catechins in green tea might reduce inflammation and protect cartilage by inhibiting proteoglycan and collagen breakdown ( 12486 ). Green tea polyphenols seem to lessen joint degeneration in laboratory models of rheumatoid arthritis ( 12487 ). In vitro, in articular chondrocytes, EGCG decreased the production and activity of inflammatory cytokines and production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 ( 12485 , 36387 , 36392 , 36402 , 53868 ). Green tea catechins may also inhibit cartilage protein degradation in vitro ( 36377 ), as well as reduce the activity of inflammatory mediators in arthritic joints of animal models ( 12487 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Catechins in green tea might have anti-inflammatory activity. Catechins derived from green tea are a laboratory standard for COX-1 inhibition ( 12849 ). Catechins from green tea also might inhibit the production of leukotriene-B4 and the activity of 5-lipoxygenase ( 12850 ). EGCG inhibits interleukin (IL)-1 beta-induced COX-2 and nitric oxide synthase activity ( 12485 ). EGCG and other catechins in green tea might also reduce inflammation and protect cartilage by inhibiting proteoglycan and collagen breakdown ( 12486 ). The anti-inflammatory activities of catechins may be due to their suppression of migration and suppressed activity of inflammatory cells, possibly in a manner related to cytokine inhibition as shown in vitro ( 53794 , 53832 ) or by inhibiting proteins promoting chemotaxis of these cells ( 53941 ). In human research, however, the effects of green tea or its constituents on inflammatory mediators are unclear. In some studies, the effects of green tea on all measured inflammatory mediators in the blood were lacking, including C-reactive protein (CRP), adiponectin, IL-6, IL-1beta, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and leptin ( 53730 , 53995 ). However, in other studies, green tea reduced levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, sVCAM-1, and/or CRP ( 53730 , 54012 , 54068 , 104606 ). A meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that green tea increases IL-6 levels, decreases TNF-alpha levels, and does not affect CRP levels ( 102003 ). Anticancer effects Green tea may protect against some kinds of cancer. Polyphenols in tea appear to have antimutagenic effects and may protect DNA ( 12523 ). In humans, green tea reduces DNA damage in lymphocytes, possibly by increasing the activity of the DNA repair enzyme human oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) and the antioxidant enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 ( 90148 ). Preliminary animal research suggests EGCG might prevent new blood vessel growth (angiogenesis) in tumors. EGCG may also inhibit tumor cell proliferation, causing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis ( 1454 , 1455 , 1456 , 8117 , 11309 , 15662 , 36419 , 54042 ). ECG appears to induce apoptosis in cancer cells by reactive oxygen species formation and mitochondrial depolarization ( 8118 , 53937 , 53971 ). Green tea may also reduce oxidative DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and free radical generation ( 4212 ). Green tea may also reduce mutagenic activity in smokers ( 4217 , 53710 , 53715 , 54083 ). Green tea is thought to be beneficial for preventing skin damage and cancer from ultraviolet (UV) radiation due to the antioxidant effects of polyphenols in green tea. In animal models of skin cancer, applying green tea polyphenols topically reduces progression of skin papillomas to squamous cell carcinoma ( 15066 , 15068 ). Polyphenolic extracts of green tea, specifically EGCG and epicatechin-3-gallate, seem to produce dose-dependent topical protection against UVA and UVB sunburn. Areas of skin where green tea extracts were applied had fewer sunburned cells and less damage to epidermal Langerhans cells, which are responsible for cutaneous immune response. Green tea extracts also seem to prevent UV radiation-induced DNA damage ( 1359 ) and apoptotic keratinocytes ( 53787 ). Animal models indicate that green tea extracts reduce oxidative skin damage, skin inflammation, and epidermal hyperplasia due to UV radiation and other causes ( 6065 ). Unlike conventional sunscreens, green tea extracts do not absorb significant amounts of light in the UV range ( 1359 ). Green tea polyphenols also appear to have activity against human papilloma virus (HPV)-related cervical dysplasia and genital and perianal warts (Condylomata acuminata) ( 11310 , 15067 ); however, the mechanism of action is not known. In adults with high-risk oral premalignant lesions, green tea extract downregulated stromal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cyclin D1 expression which was associated with clinical suppression of oral premalignant lesions ( 53936 ). Some evidence suggests that green tea may enhance the anticancer effects of some chemotherapeutic agents. There is preliminary in vitro and xenograft evidence that green tea might enhance the effects of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) on tumor cells ( 3940 , 90152 , 90157 , 90165 , 90182 ). The caffeine, theanine, and EGCG constituents appear to increase the concentration of doxorubicin inside tumor cells by inhibiting the efflux mechanisms that remove doxorubicin from the cell ( 7690 , 90152 , 90157 , 90165 ). Also, in vitro evidence suggests that EGCG increases apoptosis induced by gemcitabine ( 53843 ). Also, in a tamoxifen-resistant cell line in vitro, EGCG reduced the activity of the proteins, P-glycoprotein and the Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), which play a role in drug metabolism and transport ( 90142 ). EGCG from green tea is structurally similar to methotrexate and aminopterin and also appears to inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. This antifolate activity results in inhibition of lymphoma cell growth and apoptosis in vitro ( 15012 ). In vitro, EGCG inhibited the proteolytic enzyme urokinase, which is involved in tumor invasion and metastasis ( 53732 , 54099 ). EGCG has also been shown to downregulate the laminin receptor, involved in cell differentiation, migration, and adhesion ( 53913 ) and inhibits the migration and invasion of some cell lines ( 53862 ). The inhibition of the metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) by EGCG and green tea may also play a role in the inhibition of migration of cancer cells ( 53997 ). Antiproliferative effects of EGCG may be modulated through the upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor-2 (Nrf2) expression and increases in uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-1A (UGT1A) levels in vitro and in animal models ( 53908 ). In pancreatic cells in vitro, proliferation was inhibited by EGCG by a mechanism involving the inhibition of the focal adhesion kinase and the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor ( 54020 ). Anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects There is some evidence green tea suppresses thromboxane formation during blood clotting by inhibiting the release of arachidonic acid from platelets ( 8028 , 12882 , 54067 , 54078 ). Antidiabetic effects Caffeine has been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose. In people with type 2 diabetes, acute administration of caffeine impairs postprandial glucose metabolism, while acute abstention from caffeine reduces postprandial glucose levels by 21%. Whether these effects also occur with caffeinated beverages and herbs is unknown ( 12374 ). Other research in obese people suggests that caffeine ingestion may contribute to insulin resistance ( 12375 , 13744 ). However, one study found that patients with type 1 diabetes taking 200 mg of caffeine twice daily had increased frequency and intensity of warning signs of hypoglycemia. This may be due to a reduction in blood flow to the brain and an increase in glucose utilization by the brain ( 6024 ). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine ( 13740 ). Green tea itself has also been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose, or no effect, in human research. However, a meta-analysis of numerous clinical trials suggests that there is a decrease in blood glucose when individuals with diabetes, prediabetes, and normal glucose levels are combined ( 54011 , 54035 , 54056 , 54068 , 90154 ). In addition, taking green tea reduces postprandial glucose levels at an evening meal, but not a morning meal, possibly by reducing levels of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( 102724 ). In animal diabetic models, green tea extract and EGCG decreased blood glucose ( 3922 , 53749 ). Antidiarrheal effects Tannins in green tea can produce antidiarrheal effects. The polyphenols in green tea might increase the level of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and reduce the population of enterobacteria ( 3941 ). Antilipemic effects In human research, green tea taken orally seems to lower total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol ( 11308 , 54038 , 54048 , 90146 , 90161 ). Some of this research also suggests green tea may lower triglycerides and increase levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. In animal research, green tea also resulted in a decrease in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels ( 53890 , 54101 ). Possible mechanisms of action may involve the inhibition of ileal apical sodium bile acid transporter (ASBT) activity as shown by EGCG in vitro ( 53958 ). Antioxidant effects The antioxidant effects of green tea and its constituent catechins are thought to explain some of its clinical effects, especially related to its anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, and cardiovascular benefits. In human research, green tea and its catechins have been shown to protect against the oxidative damage caused by exercise ( 53766 , 54053 ) and smoking ( 4212 , 53791 ), as well as general oxidative exposure ( 53734 , 53989 , 53994 , 54068 , 54117 , 90168 ). One meta-analysis of clinical trials shows that green tea increases total antioxidant capacity but does not reduce levels of malondialdehyde. However, no antioxidant effects were identified in a meta-analysis of research on individuals with obesity ( 107157 ) or in a clinical trial on individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ( 114894 ). The antioxidant effects of green tea and its constituents may relate to their ability to scavenge free radicals, chelate redox active transition-metal ions, inhibit redox active transcription factors, inhibit pro-oxidant enzymes, and induce antioxidant enzymes ( 53750 , 53772 , 53794 , 53817 , 53837 , 53912 , 53960 , 90172 , 90174 ). However, some studies in humans have not shown these antioxidant benefits ( 9230 , 36583 , 36592 , 53734 , 53735 ). Antiviral effects In vitro, the catechins in green tea have shown activity against HIV replication, although less so than black tea, which contains theaflavins ( 15658 ). In vitro, the green tea constituent EGCG has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 infectivity of human T cells and macrophages, as well as antigen production, by a mechanism not involving cytotoxicity, cell growth inhibition, or apoptosis ( 53840 ). EGCG has also been shown to inhibit the activity of and degrade the semen-derived enhancer of virus infection (SEVI), possibly leading to decreased semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection ( 53871 ). Tea polyphenols are also nonspecifically effective against both influenza A and B viruses; the polyphenols bind to the hemagglutinin of influenza virus, inhibiting absorption and entry into cells ( 36544 ). In vitro, EGCG inhibited infection of kidney cells by rotaviruses and enteroviruses, in a manner involving interference with virus adsorption ( 36417 ). In vitro, green tea extract decreased the efficiency of the vaccinia virus ( 53965 ). Although there is little information in humans, green tea capsules resulted in a reduced human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) in HTLV-1 carriers ( 53717 ). Blood pressure effects There is contradictory evidence about tea consumption and hypertension. Some population research suggests drinking green tea reduces the risk of developing hypertension ( 12518 ). Also, some clinical research suggests that taking green tea extract reduces blood pressure in patients with or without hypertension ( 54068 , 90146 , 90155 , 90159 , 90161 ). However, other clinical and epidemiological studies on normotensive and hypertensive patients show that green tea or black tea has no effect on blood pressure ( 1452 , 15655 , 54080 ). Furthermore, increases in blood pressure have been shown in some studies ( 54014 , 54065 ). Also, caffeine, found in green tea, can acutely elevate both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, although caffeine may not have this effect in habitual users ( 2722 ). In animal research, green tea extracts prevented angiotensin-induced increases in blood pressure and heart tissue damage, possibly via the prevention of hydrogen peroxide radicals ( 53757 , 53798 ). Bone effects Epidemiological research suggests that drinking green tea for at least ten years increases bone mineral density. The exact mechanism for the effects on bone is unknown, but several possibilities have been suggested. Tea leaves contain fluoride, which might slow osteoporosis. Tea also contains flavonoids and phytoestrogens, which might affect bone mineral density. Other proposed mechanisms include inhibition of bone resorption and effects on mineral metabolism by polyphenols and tannins ( 8116 ). Green tea extract is also of interest for modulating facial development in children with Down syndrome. Animal research suggests that green tea extract beneficially alters craniofacial skeletons; however, high doses had negative effects ( 107167 ). Cardiovascular effects The cardiovascular effects of green tea may be related to its constituent polyphenols and/or caffeine. Green tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine ( 519 ) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup ( 4218 ). The caffeine in green tea stimulates the heart and possibly the pressor centers that control blood pressure ( 2722 ). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition ( 2722 ). By blocking adenosine receptors, caffeine is thought to increase the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine ( 6370 ). Caffeine can have positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart ( 11836 ). Some preliminary studies show that flavonoids found in green tea might reduce lipoprotein oxidation ( 6032 , 6033 , 9232 ). In vitro tests indicate that catechins in green tea reduce proliferation of vascular smooth muscle that occurs with high concentrations of low-density lipoproteins ( 9229 ). However, when used in humans, green tea doesn't consistently exhibit useful effects on cardiovascular risk factors. In human research, green tea consumption promoted flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery and improved the function of endothelial cells in blood vessels ( 53721 , 53743 , 53778 ). However, does not always appear to reduce inflammation, vascular reactivity, or lipid oxidation, and cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers may not be affected ( 37785 ). This may be due to low bioavailability of polyphenols ( 9230 , 9231 ). CNS effects Green tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine ( 519 ) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup ( 4218 ). The caffeine in green tea stimulates the central nervous system (CNS) ( 2722 ). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition ( 2722 ). By blocking adenosine receptors, caffeine is thought to increase the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine ( 6370 ). It has also been proposed that caffeine may decrease GABA and serotonin signaling ( 6370 ). Cognitive effects Green tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine ( 519 ) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup ( 4218 ). The caffeine content is thought to be responsible for green tea's effects on cognitive performance ( 4221 ). Cytochrome P450 effects Tea has been reported to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A1, 1A2, and 2B1 ( 3941 , 53739 ) and to inhibit CYP3A4 ( 53835 ) in vitro. While one study reported that green tea extract does not alter CYP3A4 or 2D6 activity in healthy volunteers ( 14429 ), another showed that green tea catechin induced a small reduction in CYP34A activity, while having no effect on CYP1A2, CYP12D6, and CYP12C9 activity ( 53747 ). Dental effects In human research, green tea extract appears to reduce plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation ( 7594 ). Also, when applied as a gel to the periodontal pocket, green tea appears to improve gingivitis, periodontal disease, and clinical attachment ( 90135 ). The polyphenols in green tea appear to reduce the cellular adhesiveness of bacteria associated with dental disease ( 7594 , 53738 , 54121 ). Also, green tea has demonstrated direct activity against oral bacteria in vitro ( 53705 , 53858 , 54022 , 54060 , 54071 ) and in humans after rinsing with green tea ( 102725 , 102727 ). In addition, certain green tea constituents inhibit the synthesis of bacterial insoluble glucan, the sticky substance that facilitates the accumulation of the microorganisms on smooth tooth surfaces and subsequent development of dental caries ( 36456 , 54121 ). Also, in vitro evidence suggests that the catechins epicatechin gallate (ECG) and EGCG inhibit pro-inflammatory signals normally upregulated by bacterial pathogens in dental pulp fibroblasts ( 53972 ). In humans, EGCG has been shown to reduce the progression of dental erosion, possibly mediated through its ability to inhibit the MMP enzymes ( 53975 ). Dermatological effects Some evidence suggests that oral and topical application of products containing green tea may improve skin elasticity, hydration, and roughness ( 53731 , 53924 , 54030 , 54062 ). Evidence suggests that EGCG and EGC might inhibit 5 alpha-reductase and might potentially be useful in androgen-mediated skin disorders such as androgenic alopecia, hirsutism, and acne ( 8113 ). Green tea is thought to be beneficial for preventing skin damage and cancer from ultraviolet (UV) radiation due to the antioxidant effects of polyphenols in green tea. Polyphenolic extracts of green tea, specifically EGCG and epicatechin-3-gallate, seem to produce dose-dependent topical protection against UVA and UVB sunburn. Areas of skin where green tea extracts were applied had fewer sunburned cells and less damage to epidermal Langerhans cells, which are responsible for cutaneous immune response. Green tea extracts also seem to prevent UV radiation-induced DNA damage ( 1359 ). Animal models indicate that green tea extracts reduce oxidative skin damage, skin inflammation, and epidermal hyperplasia due to UV radiation and other causes ( 6065 ). Human research suggests topical application of EGCG on sun-protected skin prevents the UVB-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells and erythema, possibly by inhibiting prostaglandins ( 53674 , 90167 ). Unlike conventional sunscreens, green tea extracts do not absorb significant amounts of light in the UV range ( 1359 ). Preliminary clinical research also suggests that topical application of EGCG reduces acne severity ( 54074 ). The beneficial effects of green tea for acne may be related to both the inhibition of Propionibacterium acnes, as well as the cytotoxic effects on sebocytes leading to a reduced sebum production as shown in vitro ( 54074 ). Diuretic effects Green tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine ( 519 ) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup ( 4218 ). Caffeine exerts a diuretic effect, with water losses estimated at 1.17 mL per milligram of caffeine ( 2712 ). Tachyphylaxis to the diuretic effect develops rapidly, diminishing fluid losses associated with caffeine intake ( 10206 ). However, caffeine-containing beverages consumed during moderate endurance exercise do not appear to compromise bodily hydration status ( 2713 ). Also, caffeine doesn't substantially affect the fluid status of people who drink caffeinated beverages on a regular basis ( 10206 ). Exercise effects In human research, green tea polyphenols improved muscular endurance ( 54040 ). The caffeine content of green tea is thought to be responsible for its effects on performance ( 4221 ). Also, protection against exercise-induced antioxidant damage may play a role ( 54053 , 104606 ). Gastrointestinal effects Green tea is commonly used for the prevention of gastric cancer. The caffeine in green tea is known to stimulate gastric acid secretion ( 11837 ). Hepatic effects Although case reports exist of hepatotoxic effects of green tea and its extract ( 14136 , 15026 , 53740 , 53742 , 53746 , 53775 , 54016 , 54027 , 90143 , 90164 )( 92356 , 102722 ), clinical research suggests the potential for benefits in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ( 90168 ). Also, population research suggests consuming more green tea, especially more than 10 cups daily, is related to decreased concentrations of hepatological markers in serum, including aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transferase, and ferritin, indicating that green tea may act protectively against disorders of the liver ( 6403 ). Hormonal effects Population research shows mixed results with respect to the preventative effects of green tea for breast cancer or its recurrence ( 3926 , 13189 , 14426 , 14427 , 53866 , 54112 , 90181 ). Interestingly, green tea intake is inversely correlated with serum concentrations of estradiol on menstrual cycle day 11 in females; this may explain the potential for benefit in hormone-related cancers ( 54106 ). Also, in animal research, green tea reduced blood levels of testosterone, estradiol, leptin, luteinizing hormone, and insulin-like growth factor ( 3922 ). However, in humans, the green tea extract enriched in EGCG, Polyphenon E did not have consistent effects on testosterone, estradiol, and estrone levels ( 54056 ). Immunologic effects There is some evidence from clinical research that taking green tea formulations reduces the risk of developing clinical cold or flu symptoms ( 53754 , 54021 ). Also, clinical research suggests that drinking a green tea high in a specific catechin reduces allergy symptoms associated with Japanese cedar pollen ( 53884 , 90156 ). In human research, green tea increased the proliferation of gamma-delta T cells ( 53754 ). Also, in vitro, in Jurkat T cells, EGCG induced the production of specific cytokines ( 53830 ). Neurologic effects Green tea is thought to have some potential neurological benefits. For prevention of Parkinson's disease, caffeine in green tea may prevent adenosine's inhibition of dopaminergic transmission. This may result in a reduction in the clinical expression of Parkinsonism ( 6022 , 36389 ). Green tea may also inhibit dopamine transport in vitro, as well as protect against effects of 6-hydroxydopamine ( 53706 , 53841 ). In vitro, EGCG has been shown to prevent the damage of dopaminergic cells by activated microglial cells by inhibiting nitric oxide and cytokine production ( 36407 ). Preliminary evidence also suggests that EGCG may prevent oxidation and apoptosis of neurons, which may protect people from developing Alzheimer's disease ( 9224 ). Also, in vitro and in animals, EGCG has been shown to increase the secretion of soluble amyloid precursor protein or decrease levels of A beta protein, inhibiting the formation of beta-amyloid peptide, associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease ( 36396 , 53751 ). The green tea constituent EGCG may also directly affect brain function. In humans, EGCG increased alpha, beta, and theta activity, mainly in the frontal and medial frontal gyrus ( 54055 ) and brain theta waves in the temporal, frontal, parietal, and occipital areas ( 54019 ). Clinical research in adults with obesity suggests that following exercise guidance in conjunction with a calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet enriched with an additional daily intake of 800 mg polyphenols from green tea and Wolffia globose may provide neuroprotective effects against age-related neurodegeneration by reducing grey matter atrophy and preserving hippocampal volume ( 107982 ). Respiratory effects Green tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine ( 519 ) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup ( 4218 ). Caffeine decreases airway resistance and stimulates respiration, via adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition ( 11836 ). Weight loss effects Green tea is commonly used for weight loss. Evidence from clinical trials is mixed, although some studies do show weight loss with specific products ( 8114 , 37725 , 53994 , 54039 ). Early evidence indicates that a green tea extract rich in EGCG can increase calorie and fat metabolism. The caffeine, catechin, and theanine constituents of green tea might contribute to this effect ( 1453 , 8115 , 11960 ). Caffeine increases resting energy expenditure (REE) and cellular thermogenesis. It also causes an increase in nonoxidative fatty acid turnover and lipid oxidation; however, the net effect on lipid oxidation is small. The effects of caffeine on energy expenditure and lipid metabolism seem to be mediated by both sympathetic and nonsympathetic mechanisms ( 13733 ). Green tea might also affect energy expenditure in humans. However, thermogenic response or energy expenditure were not significantly increased in all studies ( 1453 , 8114 , 37712 , 48831 , 53685 , 53708 , 53869 , 53999 , 54122 , 98422 ). In healthy young men, green tea extract increased fat oxidation during exercise ( 53764 ). There is also some evidence that EGCG might suppress appetite in animal research ( 3922 ). However, there is some question about how well EGCG is absorbed orally ( 3922 ). In human research, although green tea reduced food intakes, changes in body weight and body composition were lacking ( 98422 ). The impact of EGCG and green tea on weight loss remains to be determined with well-designed studies in obese or overweight individuals.</data><data key="general_safety">Likely Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Green%20Tea</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Likely Effective Human papillomavirus (HPV). A specific green tea extract ointment (Polyphenon E ointment 15%) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating external genital warts caused by HPV. A specific green tea extract ointment (Veregen, Bradley Pharmaceuticals; Polyphenon E ointment 15%, MediGene AG) providing 150 mg of sinecatechins per gram of ointment, applied three times daily to external warts, completely clears external genital and perianal warts in 24% to 60% of patients after 10-16 weeks of treatment ( 15067 , 36438 , 36442 , 53777 , 53907 , 54018 ). This green tea extract is an FDA-approved prescription product ( 15067 ). more Possibly Effective Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Drinking green tea seems to reduce the risk of CVD and CVD-related mortality. Large-scale population research in Japan suggests that consuming at least 3-5 cups of green tea daily is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality when compared with drinking less than 1 cup daily. This association appears to be primarily related to a decrease in risk for cerebral infarction and heart disease. This association appears to be stronger in females than in males ( 14498 , 53789 , 100202 ). Population research also suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of CVD. One meta-analysis suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a 28% reduced risk of CAD ( 54017 ). Another meta-analysis suggests that consuming small to moderate amounts of green tea, 1-5 cups or 300 to 1500 mL daily, is associated with an 8% to 16% reduced risk of coronary heart disease over 5 to 13 years when compared with consuming no green tea ( 111017 ). One meta-analysis suggests that a 1 cup increase in green tea consumption is associated with a 5% reduced risk of CVD mortality and a 3% reduced risk of CVD events ( 102728 ). When compared with drinking less than 1 cup of green tea daily, epidemiological research in a population at high risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) suggests that drinking more than 3 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 46% reduced odds of having CAD, especially severe CAD, as determined by a coronary angiography ( 104588 ). A sub-group analysis suggests that these odds only occurred in individuals consuming fruits more than 4 times weekly and not in individuals consuming fruits less often ( 104588 ). However, some population research suggests that any association seems to be greater for males than females ( 53691 ). Other population studies suggest that general tea consumption might protect against ischemic heart disease or death from CVD; however, many of the tea drinkers in some of these studies consumed black tea rather than green tea ( 8119 , 8120 , 8121 , 102728 ). more Endometrial cancer. Drinking green tea seems to be beneficial for endometrial cancer prevention. Meta-analyses of epidemiological research have found that people who drink green tea often, usually more than once daily, have a 21% to 23% reduced risk of developing endometrial cancer when compared with those who never or rarely drink green tea ( 53919 , 92409 , 102716 ). One of these meta-analyses also found that increasing green tea intake by one cup per day is associated with an 11% reduced risk of developing endometrial cancer ( 92409 ). more Hyperlipidemia. Oral green tea seems to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by a small amount. Clinical research and a meta-analysis of clinical research in people with or without hyperlipidemia shows that consuming green tea or green tea extract containing 150-2500 mg catechins daily for up to 24 weeks reduces total cholesterol by about 5-24 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol by about 2-25 mg/dL when compared with control ( 11308 , 54038 , 54048 , 90146 , 90161 , 97135 , 104605 ). There is also preliminary evidence that taking a green tea extract containing catechins 676 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces oxidation of LDL cholesterol when compared with placebo, which might lead to reduced damage to the vascular endothelium and reduced arteriosclerosis ( 98458 ). Epidemiological research has found that higher consumption of green tea, especially 10 cups daily or more, is associated with improved serum lipids in males, but not females ( 6403 , 97134 ). more Ovarian cancer. Drinking green tea seems to be beneficial for ovarian cancer prevention. Consuming tea, including green tea or black tea, appears to significantly lower the risk of developing ovarian cancer when compared with never or seldom consuming tea ( 9228 , 13208 , 90144 , 102716 ). One meta-analysis of population research suggests that the highest intake of green tea is associated with a 36% reduced risk of ovarian cancer when compared with the lowest intake ( 102716 ). Also, one prospective population study found that those who consume 2 or more cups of tea daily have a 46% lower risk of ovarian cancer when compared with those who don't regularly consume tea ( 13208 ). There also appears to be a trend that suggests higher consumption of tea or longer duration of use further reduces the risk of ovarian cancer ( 9228 , 13208 ). However, green tea does not appear to prevent ovarian cancer recurrence. Preliminary clinical research shows that drinking 500 mL of double-brewed green tea (DBGT), prepared with 35 grams/L of tea leaves standardized to contain approximately 640 mg/L of EGCG, daily for up to 18 months does not prevent cancer recurrence in adults with a history of advanced stage serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer ( 90175 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acne. Topical green tea might reduce acne lesions by a small amount. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for acne. A meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research shows that topical application of green tea extract reduces the number of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions by a small amount ( 104609 ). In one small study, applying a solution containing the green tea constituent epigallocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 1% or 5% twice daily for 8 weeks was used ( 54074 ). However, oral green tea extract had limited or no effect in one study included in a meta-analysis ( 104609 ). Higher quality studies are needed to confirm this finding. more Age-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for cognitive decline associated with age. In elderly individuals living in the community, clinical research shows that taking matcha green tea powder (Yabukita, Kyoeiseicha Co., Ltd.) 3 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve overall measures of cognitive function when compared with placebo. However, a sub-group analysis in females found a small improvement in language, but not other measures, including memory, impulsivity, and attention ( 104602 ). Other clinical research in middle aged and older adults shows that taking green tea extract (Thea-Flan 90S, ITO EN Ltd.) providing catechins 336.4 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve most measures of cognitive function, although there was a small effect on one measure of working memory. In addition, a single dose has a small effect on errors during an attention task ( 104603 ). more Amyloidosis. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for amyloidosis. Preliminary clinical research in patients with cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis shows that drinking green tea (Green Darjeeling, FTGFOP1, Teekampagne Projektwerkstatt GmbH) 1.5-2 liters standardized to contain epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 340 mg/L and/or taking specific capsules (Praevent-loges, Dr. Loges + Co. GmbH) containing 300 mg green tea extract standardized to contain EGCG 75 mg/capsule for 12 months protects against an increase in left ventricular wall thickness and left ventricular myocardial mass ( 54064 ). more Anxiety. Although there has been interest in using oral green tea for anxiety, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition. Athletic performance. The evidence on the effects of green tea constituents for athletic performance is conflicting. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking green tea extract containing up to 572.8 mg of catechins as a beverage does not improve respiration efficiency, maximal oxygen uptake, or time trial performance in individuals undergoing endurance training when compared with beverages without catechins ( 53987 , 53991 ). However, other preliminary research shows that taking specific pills (Teavigo, Healthy Origins) containing epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 135 mg/pill, taken three times daily with meals for a total dose of seven pills, improves maximal oxygen uptake but not maximum work rate or respiration efficiency, in healthy adults when compared with placebo ( 53944 ). Also, a small study in untrained adults shows that taking a single dose of green tea polyphenols 640 mg, 90 minutes before exercise, increases maximal oxygen uptake. However, the effect on athletic performance was not determined ( 104606 ). more Beta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for reducing iron accumulation in beta-thalassemia. A small clinical trial shows that taking green tea 3 cups daily after meals for 12 months, in addition to usual treatment with blood transfusions and deferasirox, an iron chelator, reduces levels of liver iron and serum ferritin by moderate amounts when compared with usual treatment alone. Hemoglobin values did not differ between groups. Each green tea bag contained 2 grams green tea (Lipton, Unilever Gulf) ( 104601 ). more Bladder cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for bladder cancer prevention. Some epidemiological evidence suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer ( 1458 , 1459 , 90179 ). However, conflicting evidence exists. A meta-analysis of some epidemiological evidence suggests that drinking green tea is not associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer ( 54077 , 90166 , 102716 ). more Breast cancer. Evidence evaluating the association between green tea intake and breast cancer risk is inconsistent; any association may be dependent on genotype and menopausal status. Meta-analyses of cohort and case-control studies have found that green tea intake is not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer ( 98460 , 102716 ). However, some individual population studies suggests that green tea intake is associated with a reduced odds of developing breast cancer in Asian-American ( 14427 , 53866 ), but not Asian ( 13189 , 14426 , 90181 ), populations. Any protective effect of green tea on breast cancer risk might depend on patient genotype or menopausal status. Green tea consumption does not seem to lower breast cancer risk in Asian females with low-activity angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotype, although it does seem to decrease breast cancer risk in Asian females with high-activity ACE genotype ( 14430 ). Similarly, Asian-American females who drink green tea seem to have a lower breast cancer risk if they have low-activity catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype. However, they do not seem to benefit if they do not have the low-activity COMT genotype ( 14431 ). Additionally, some observational research suggests that there is a link between green tea and modestly reduced breast cancer risk in pre-menopausal, but not postmenopausal, females ( 99788 ). Some research has evaluated the effect of green tea on breast cancer recurrence. Population research suggests that Asian females who have had stage I or II breast cancer who drink at least 3 cups of green tea daily seem to have reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence ( 3926 , 13189 , 54112 ). However, drinking green tea does not seem to significantly reduce the risk of recurrence of later-stage breast cancer. In April 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming green tea may reduce the risk of breast cancer, although the FDA has concluded that there is very little scientific evidence to support this claim ( 102106 ). more Cervical cancer. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for cervical cancer. Clinical research in adults with persistent high-risk HPV (HR HPV) infection and concomitant low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia shows that taking a specific green tea extract (Polyphenon E), four capsules standardized to contain epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 200 mg/capsule, once daily for 4 months does not affect HR HPV-positive status or histological outcomes when compared with placebo ( 90145 ). more Cervical dysplasia. It is unclear if topical green tea is beneficial for cervical dysplasia. Preliminary clinical research shows that applying a specific ointment (Polyphenon E ointment 15%, MediGene AG) containing epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) to human papilloma virus (HPV)-infected cervical lesions twice weekly and/or taking a specific green tea extract (Polyphenon E) 200 mg daily containing EGCG by mouth for 8-12 weeks can improve lesion appearance when compared with control ( 11310 ). more Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there has been interest in using oral green tea for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if drinking green tea reduces the risk of COPD. One prospective, observational study in older adults has found that consumption of at least 3 cups daily of tea, including green tea, oolong tea, and black tea, is associated with a 23% reduction in COPD prevalence and a 65% reduced risk of developing COPD in models adjusted for potential confounders when compared with the lowest tea consumption ( 107201 ). However, green tea was only consumed by about 19% of the population included in this study and consumption of green tea itself was not associated with a reduced risk of COPD. more Cognitive function. It is unclear if oral green tea improves cognitive function in healthy adults. A small clinical study in adults ages 50-69 years shows that taking matcha powder (Hojin no shiro, Ito En, Ltd.) 9 capsules daily for 12 weeks, providing 170 mg total catechins daily, modestly improves some measures of attention and work performance when compared with taking placebo or caffeine. However, there was no effect on other measures of these outcomes, or on verbal memory tasks, visual information processing, working memory, motor function, or facial expression recognition ( 107168 ). Another small clinical study shows that taking a single dose of the green tea constituent, epigallocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG), 135 or 270 mg does not seem to improve mood or cognitive performance in healthy adults ( 54059 ). Green tea has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in healthy adults shows that consuming a multi-ingredient beverage containing green tea powder 50 mg, elderberry extract, carob extract, and guarana seed extract improves some measures of cognitive function such as rapid visual information processing and multitasking, but not others, 120 minutes later when compared with placebo ( 113940 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to green tea, other ingredients, or the combination. more Cognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of mild cognitive impairment in elderly adults. Some population research in elderly individuals has found that drinking green tea at least once per week is associated with a 53% reduced incidence of dementia or mild cognitive impairment when compared to not consuming green tea ( 104598 ). In addition, drinking at least two cups of green tea daily was associated with a 54% lower prevalence of cognitive impairment ( 104611 ). A clinical study in adults with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive decline shows that taking oral matcha green tea powder capsules 2 grams daily for 12 months does not improve activities of daily living scores or measures of cognitive function compared with placebo ( 116753 ). Green tea has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Some clinical research shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product containing green tea extract 360 mg/capsule and L-theanine 60 mg/capsule (LGNC-07, LG Household &amp; Health Care, Ltd) twice daily after meals for 16 weeks improves memory and attention in patients with mild cognitive impairment when compared with placebo ( 54019 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to green tea, other ingredients, or the combination. more Colorectal adenoma. It is unclear if oral green tea extract is beneficial for reducing colorectal adenoma recurrence. A large clinical trial in patients with previously removed colorectal adenomas shows that taking green tea extract (Dr. Loges + Co. GmbH) standardized to epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) 150 mg twice daily for 3 years does not affect the risk of developing new metachronous adenomas when compared with taking placebo ( 111020 ). However, a sub-group analysis shows that taking green tea extract results in a 10% absolute reduction in risk of adenoma formation in males, but not females ( 111020 ). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients with previously removed colorectal adenomas shows that taking green tea extract 1.5 grams daily for 12 months reduces the incidence of metachronous adenomas when compared with placebo ( 53816 ). more Colorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for colorectal cancer prevention. Although evidence from individual population studies is mixed ( 9222 , 9223 , 14498 , 90176 , 90178 , 90181 , 102718 ), meta-analyses of population research suggest that a high intake of green tea is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer ( 36416 , 102716 ). The highest intake of green tea is associated with a 16% reduced risk when compared with the lowest; however, the benefit appears to be specific to colon cancer, not rectal cancer ( 102716 ). When subdivided according to gender, evidence from case-control research suggests that green tea is associated with a reduced risk of colon and rectal cancer for females ( 54096 ). more Common cold. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for the common cold. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking two capsules of a specific formulation (ImmuneGuard, Nutraceutical Holdings LLC) containing L-theanine (Suntheanine, Taiyo International) plus epigallocatechin gallate (Sunphenon, Taiyo International) twice daily for 3 months reduces cold or flu symptoms and duration of symptoms when compared with placebo in healthy adults ( 53754 ). more Crohn disease. Although there has been interest in using oral green tea for Crohn disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition. Dementia. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for dementia prevention. A meta-analysis of observational studies in over 20,000 adults suggests that the risk of any cognitive deficit (including mild cognitive impairment and dementia) is associated with a 6% reduction per cup of green tea consumed daily ( 107829 ). Some population research in elderly individuals suggests that drinking green tea at least once per week is associated with a 53% reduced incidence of dementia or mild cognitive impairment when compared to not consuming green tea ( 104598 ). Other population research in adults ages 40-74 years suggests that drinking at least 600 mL of green tea daily is not associated with a reduced risk of developing dementia when compared with drinking less than 60 mL daily. However, there is a modest reduction in dementia risk specifically in individuals ages 60-69 years ( 107164 ). A prospective, observational study suggests that consumption of tea, including both green and black tea, of at least 4 cups, in conjunction with 0.5-1 cups of coffee, daily is associated with a 30% reduced risk of dementia when compared with not drinking tea or coffee. Also, drinking 2-3 cups daily of both tea and coffee is associated with a 28% reduced risk of dementia when compared with not drinking tea and coffee ( 107204 ). Any association between drinking green tea specifically and developing dementia cannot be determined from this study. more Dental plaque. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for reducing dental plaque. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that use of oral or topical products containing green tea modestly reduces dental plaque when compared with control products, including triclosan toothpaste, placebo, and chlorhexidine rinse. However, a sub-group analysis shows that a green tea rinse is no more effective than a chlorhexidine rinse. Green tea products in these studies included mouth rinse, paste, tea, capsules, and strips ( 107156 ). Many of these studies are limited by a lack of clear blinding. A more recent clinical study in children ages 10-14 years with plaque and gingivitis shows that using a mouthwash containing green tea extract 5% twice daily, alone or at half strength with ginger extract, for 30 days reduces plaque and gingivitis severity. The mouthwash containing the combination of green tea and ginger extract was most effective, and the green tea extract alone was at least as effective as chlorhexidine ( 107163 ). more Depression. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for depression prevention. Epidemiological research suggests that consuming green tea is associated with a reduced prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms. In Japanese adults, drinking four or more cups of green tea daily is associated with a 44% to 51% lower prevalence of mild to severe depression when compared to consuming one cup or less daily ( 90160 , 90163 ). A meta-analysis suggests that the highest green tea consumption is associated with a 34% reduced risk of depressive symptoms when compared with the lowest ( 111024 ). Other research in a general population of Chinese adults suggests that consuming at least 1 cup of green tea daily is associated with a 22% decreased risk of depressive symptoms over 2 years when compared with almost never consuming green tea. However, there is no association between depressive symptoms and less frequent green tea consumption in this population ( 111023 ). more Diabetes. It is unclear if drinking green tea or taking green tea extract is beneficial for the prevention of diabetes or the improvement of glycemic control. Epidemiological research has found that Japanese adults who consume 6 or more cups of green tea daily have a 33% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to those who consume one cup or less daily. The risk reduction appears to be more pronounced in females when compared with males ( 14313 ). Also, epidemiological research has found that Chinese adults who consume at least one cup of green tea per week have a 59% to 77% lower risk of impaired fasting glucose when compared to those who consume less than one cup per week ( 90149 ). Other epidemiological research has found that consumption of any amount of green tea daily by Chinese adults is associated with an 8% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with never drinking green tea ( 107165 ). In contrast, some epidemiological research in Chinese adults has found that green tea consumption is associated with a 20% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with non-green tea drinkers. A dose-response relationship was found for both the amount and duration of tea consumed ( 107170 ). Also, clinical research in patients with prediabetes shows that drinking one cup of green tea three times daily for 14 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared to control ( 90174 ). There is inconsistent evidence regarding the effects of green tea in patients with type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological research suggests that drinking at least 4 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 40% reduction in mortality risk when compared to not drinking green tea ( 104589 ). Other epidemiological research in patients with type 2 diabetes has found that consumption of any amount of green tea daily is associated with a 10% reduction in mortality risk when compared to never drinking green tea. However, there was no association between green tea intake and the incidence of developing macrovascular or microvascular complications ( 107165 ). Meta-analyses of clinical research show that green tea extract and green tea catechins reduce fasting blood glucose when compared to control when patients with type 2 diabetes, borderline diabetes, or normal blood glucose status are evaluated together ( 90154 , 90187 ). However, a meta-analysis of up to 15 mainly small clinical trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking green tea does not affect fasting blood glucose or insulin or improve insulin resistance or glucose control when compared with placebo. Most included studies used green tea or its extract in doses of 400-10,000 mg daily for 8-16 weeks ( 104604 ). Also, clinical research shows that taking green tea extract daily for up to 16 weeks does not improve blood glucose, HbA1c, or insulin when compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes or borderline diabetes ( 37678 , 37781 , 54035 ). Some research has evaluated the effect of green tea on other outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. One meta-analysis shows that taking green tea extract modestly reduces fasting triglyceride levels when compared with control. This benefit was seen with doses of at least 800 mg daily taken for longer than 8 weeks. This dose and duration reduces levels of total cholesterol, but not low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels ( 102715 ). Another meta-analysis shows that taking green tea modestly reduces body weight, body mass index (BM), and body fat. A sub-analysis shows that these benefits occur in studies lasting more than 8 weeks, using doses of up to 800 mg daily, and in patients who were overweight. There was no effect on waist circumference. Most patients included in the analysis were overweight or had obesity ( 104610 ). more Diabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for improving diabetic neuropathy symptoms. Clinical research in patients with mild-to-moderate diabetic peripheral neuropathy shows that taking decaffeinated green tea extract 500 mg three times daily for 16 weeks modestly reduces neural pain and dysfunction, as well as overall symptom severity, when compared with placebo ( 107159 ). more Down syndrome. It is unclear if oral green tea is able to alter facial morphology in children with Down syndrome. A small case series has found that taking green tea extract daily, starting during the first 3 years of life, is associated with reduced facial dysmorphology in six of seven children with Down syndrome. There was no effect in children aged 4-18 years ( 107167 ). This study is limited by its observational design. The dosage, time of onset, and duration of treatment differed between individuals. more Dry eye. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for improving dry eye symptoms. In patients with mild to moderate dry eye and meibomian gland dysfunction, preliminary clinical research shows that applying green tea extract into the eyes three times daily for one month, in addition to artificial tears three times daily, improves symptoms of dry eye. Symptoms of itching, burning, foreign body sensation, and redness were improved by a moderate amount over artificial tears alone ( 104612 ). more Dysmenorrhea. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for preventing dysmenorrhea symptoms. Population research has found that drinking green tea is associated with a 37% reduced odds of experiencing dysmenorrhea and a 58% reduced odds of having moderate-to-severe dysmenorrhea when compared with not drinking green tea ( 102729 ). more Esophageal cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for preventing esophageal cancer; the available research is conflicting. Although some epidemiological evidence and observational studies have found that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of esophageal cancer, most meta-analyses do not support this finding in a mixed group of adults ( 1457 , 36542 , 90169 , 90185 , 90186 , 102004 , 102716 , 107154 ). Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies suggest that drinking green tea is associated with a 54% reduction in the risk of esophageal cancer, or a 21% reduced odds per cup of green tea consumed daily, only in females ( 90169 , 90185 , 102004 , 107154 ). Also, some epidemiological research found that drinking green tea that is very hot is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer ( 53828 ). In addition, drinking decaffeinated green tea 5 mg daily for 12 months does not seem to be an effective treatment for patients diagnosed with esophageal precancerous lesions ( 53702 ). more Fractures. It is unclear if drinking green tea reduces fracture risk. Population research has found that consumption of green tea is associated with a 12% lower risk of any fracture and 20% lower risk of hip fracture when compared with no tea consumption ( 99800 ). more Gastric cancer. Evidence evaluating an association between green tea consumption and gastric cancer risk is conflicting. Most meta-analyses of epidemiological studies suggest that green tea consumption is not associated with gastric cancer risk ( 53767 , 53813 , 90181 , 102716 ). Although the most recent meta-analysis of epidemiological research suggests that drinking green tea regularly is associated with up to a 9% reduced risk of gastric cancer when compared with non-regular consumption, sub-analyses suggest that there is no association between gastric cancer and intake of specific amounts of green tea up to at least 3 cups daily ( 111025 ). Also, other population research suggests that drinking 10 or more cups of green tea daily is associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer ( 8903 , 9222 , 9225 , 9226 , 9227 ), while consuming less than 10 cups daily is not consistently associated with a reduced risk ( 7033 , 9223 , 54090 ). The association between drinking green tea and gastric cancer-related mortality has also been investigated, A large-scale population study in Japan suggests that drinking 5 or more cups of green tea daily is not associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer-related mortality when compared to drinking less than one cup daily ( 14498 ). Discrepancies might be related to the temperature of the green tea. The most recent meta-analysis suggests that intake of cold or warm green tea, and not hot green tea, is associated with a modest reduction in gastric cancer risk ( 111025 ). more Gingivitis. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for gingivitis. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that use of oral or topical products containing green tea modestly reduces gingivitis and gingival bleeding when compared with control products, including triclosan toothpaste, placebo, and chlorhexidine rinse. However, a sub-group analysis shows that a green tea rinse is no more effective than a chlorhexidine rinse. Green tea products used in these studies were heterogeneous and included mouth rinse, gel, paste, tea, strips, and capsules ( 107156 ). Many of these studies are limited by a lack of clear blinding. A more recent clinical study in children ages 10-14 years with plaque and gingivitis shows that using a mouthwash containing green tea extract 5% twice daily, alone or at half-strength with ginger extract, for 30 days reduces plaque and gingivitis severity. The mouthwash containing the combination of green tea and ginger extract was most effective, and the green tea extract alone was at least as effective as chlorhexidine ( 107163 ). more Headache. Although there has been interest in using oral green tea for headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition. Hypertension. The evidence is mixed as to whether drinking green tea reduces the risk of hypertension and whether oral green tea lowers blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Some epidemiological research from China shows that drinking 120-599 mL of green tea or oolong tea daily is associated with a 46% lower risk of developing hypertension when compared with non-habitual tea drinkers; drinking more than 600 mL daily is associated with a 65% reduced risk ( 12518 ). In contrast, drinking green tea daily is associated with a 38% increased odds of having hypertension when compared with never drinking green tea in elderly Chinese males, but not females ( 107166 ). Green tea may help lower blood pressure in patients with or without hypertension; however, the evidence is mixed, and any reductions appear to be small. A meta-analysis of two clinical trials in patients with hypertension shows that drinking green tea for 4-16 weeks reduces systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure by about 6 mmHg ( 104583 ). Meta-analyses in patients with or without hypertension, including overweight or obese adults, suggest that green tea reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 1-3 mmHg ( 90146 , 90155 , 90161 , 98423 , 102726 , 111018 ). Some studies used green tea, made by boiling a 3 gram tea bag with 150 mL water and then waiting for 5 minutes and consuming three times daily approximately 2 hours after each meal for 4 weeks ( 90159 ), or green tea extract up to 1500 mg daily for up to 12 weeks ( 111018 ), including a specific product (Olimp Labs) 379 mg, taken daily with the morning meal for 3 months ( 54068 ). more Hypotension. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for postprandial hypotension in elderly adults. Some research shows that consuming caffeinated beverages increases blood pressure in elderly people with postprandial hypotension ( 11834 , 11835 ). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that drinking 400 mL of green tea before lunch increases postprandial systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 15 mmHg and 6 mmHg, respectively, in older elderly people with postprandial hypotension ( 89482 ). more Infertility. Oral green tea has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in females with a history of problems conceiving shows that taking three capsules daily of a proprietary blend of Vitex agnus-castus extract (standardized to 0.5% agnusides), green tea extract (standardized to 50% phenols), L-arginine, vitamins E, B6, and B12, folate, iron, magnesium, zinc, and selenium (FertilityBlend, The Daily Wellness Company) for three menstrual cycles increases the rate of pregnancy at three months by 61% when compared with placebo ( 41479 ). more Influenza. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing the flu. A meta-analysis of five clinical trials in individuals with or without prior influenza vaccination shows that use of green tea catechins, either in capsule form or as a gargled liquid, reduces the rate of influenza infections by 33% when compared with control. Also, a meta-analysis of observational research has found that gargling with or consuming green tea containing catechins is associated with a 48% reduced risk of influenza when compared with not taking green tea catechins. More information is needed to compare the efficacy of the different forms of green tea catechins ( 107152 ). Some epidemiological research not included in this meta-analysis has found that drinking at least 5 cups of green tea weekly is associated with a 32% reduced odds of developing confirmed influenza when compared with drinking less than one cup weekly. A sub-group analysis suggests that this association is only evident in individuals who had not received the influenza vaccination ( 104608 ). Conversely, other preliminary research shows that gargling with green tea at least three times daily for 90 days does not prevent influenza in high school students when compared with water ( 90150 ). Green tea has also been evaluated in combination with theanine. One small study shows that taking a combination of green tea catechins (THEA-FLAN 90S, Ito-en Co) 378 mg standardized to 270 mg of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) with theanine 210 mg daily for 5 months reduces the risk of developing clinically defined influenza, but not laboratory-confirmed influenza infection, when compared with placebo ( 54021 ). Other preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking two capsules of a specific formulation (ImmuneGuard, Nutraceutical Holdings LLC) containing L-theanine (Suntheanine, Taiyo International) plus EGCG (Sunphenon, Taiyo International) twice daily for 3 months reduces the number of subjects with cold or flu symptoms and the number of days with symptoms when compared with placebo ( 53754 ). more Japanese cedar pollinosis. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing Japanese cedar pollinosis symptoms. In patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis, clinical research shows that drinking Benifuuki green tea drink 350 mL containing O-methylated catechin 34-40 mg daily beginning 6-10 weeks before pollen exposure until the end of pollen season can reduce nasal and ocular symptoms. Clinical research compared the "benifuuki" drink enriched in O-methylated EGCG with that of another green tea "yabukita," containing no O-methylated EGCG ( 53884 , 90156 ). more Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). It is unclear if drinking green tea prevents kidney stones. Population research suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of having kidney stones. This risk was 22% lower in males and 16% lower in females when compared with never or former green tea drinkers ( 104613 ). more Leukemia. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for leukemia prevention. Although some large epidemiological studies suggest that drinking green tea reduces the risk of leukemia by 51% to 80% ( 53799 , 90183 , 102723 ), a meta-analysis of generally low-quality population research shows a variable association between green tea intake and risk of leukemia ( 102716 ). more Liver cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for liver cancer prevention. Two meta-analyses of epidemiological research suggest that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer ( 97132 , 111016 ). The most recent meta-analysis in approximately 1.5 million adults in Asia, North America, and Europe suggests that the highest intake of green tea is associated with a 20% reduced risk of liver cancer when compared with the lowest. The most benefit was associated with consumption of at least 4 cups daily ( 111016 ). Another meta-analysis that included studies conducted in Japan, China, or Singapore suggests that higher green tea consumption is associated with a 12% reduced incidence of liver cancer when compared with the lowest consumption of green tea. However, the benefit appears to be limited to females; green tea consumption was not associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer in males ( 97132 ). A large epidemiological study in Chinese females also suggests that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer. Consuming a cumulative intake of 30 kg dried green tea leaves is associated with a 46% reduced risk of primary liver cancer over a median of 18 years when compared with never drinking green tea ( 111030 ). In contrast, some individual epidemiological studies suggest that green tea consumption is not associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer in Japanese individuals ( 90181 , 102716 ). more Lung cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for lung cancer prevention. Individual observational studies and meta-analyses of population research have yielded conflicting evidence about the effects of green tea on lung cancer risk ( 13190 , 14498 , 53829 , 90177 , 102716 ). Although one meta-analysis of population research suggests that the highest intake of green tea does not reduce lung cancer risk when compared to the lowest intakes ( 102716 ), other analyses suggest that increasing green tea consumption by two cups daily is associated with an 18% decreased risk of lung cancer, and that drinking 7-10 cups of green tea daily is associated with an 18% to 33% reduced risk of lung cancer when compared with drinking less than one cup daily ( 53829 , 90177 ). more Mental alertness. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for mental alertness. Green tea contains caffeine. Consumption of caffeinated beverages seems to prevent a decline in alertness and cognitive capacity when consumed throughout the day ( 4221 , 4224 ). Also, combining caffeine with glucose as an "energy drink" seems to improve mental performance better than placebo or either caffeine or glucose alone ( 13732 ). However, there is mixed evidence regarding the effects of green tea on mental alertness. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for improving metabolic parameters in people with this condition. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking green tea extract 1000 mg daily or drinking four cups of green tea daily for 8 weeks does not improve metabolic syndrome features, including waist circumference, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, or blood sugar in obese patients with metabolic syndrome when compared to control ( 53995 ). more Multiple myeloma. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for multiple myeloma prevention. Population research suggests that drinking at least 5 cups of green tea each day is not associated with a reduced risk of multiple myeloma when compared with never drinking green tea ( 102723 ). more Myocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if drinking green tea prevents MI or if drinking green tea prevents mortality in patients with a previous MI. When compared with drinking less than one cup of green tea daily, epidemiological research in a population at high risk of coronary artery disease has found that drinking more than three cups of green tea daily is associated with a 49% reduced odds of having a past MI as determined by a coronary angiography. A sub-group analysis found that these odds only occurred in individuals consuming both fruits and vegetables more than four times weekly and not in individuals consuming fruits or vegetables less often ( 104588 ). In addition, observational research has found that drinking either 1-3 cups or at least 4 cups of green tea daily is associated with 19% and 32% lower odds of MI, respectively, when compared to drinking less than 1 cup daily ( 97134 ). In patients with a previous MI, drinking at least 7 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 53% reduced odds of all-cause mortality over a median of 18.5 years when compared with not drinking green tea ( 107160 ). more Nasopharyngeal cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for nasopharyngeal cancer prevention. A meta-analysis of epidemiological research has found that the highest intake of green tea is associated with a 51% reduced risk of nasopharyngeal cancer when compared with the lowest intake ( 102716 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for NAFLD. Clinical research shows that drinking green tea 700 mL containing 1080 mg of catechins daily for 12 weeks does not affect body weight or body mass index (BMI), but does reduce body fat percentage from 34% to 32%, when compared with drinking either green tea 700 mL containing 200 mg of catechins or a control tea. Also, the liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio increased by 11% when compared with baseline ( 90168 ). Meta-analyses of four studies in patients with NAFLD show that taking green tea extract 500-1000 mg daily or green tea catechins 600 mg daily improves liver function tests when compared with placebo ( 98459 , 102720 ). One meta-analysis also shows that these doses improve BMI, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo ( 98459 ). more Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for non-Hodgkin lymphoma prevention. Population research has found that drinking at least 3.5 cups of green tea daily is not associated with a reduced risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma when compared with never drinking or drinking less than 1 cup of green tea daily ( 102005 , 102723 ). more Obesity. Evidence for the use of green tea products for weight loss is conflicting. The conflicting findings may be related to the caffeine and catechin content of the studied products, as well as the physical activity level of the individual. Many clinical studies show that drinking green tea or taking green tea extract that contains caffeine (about 70-200 mg) and high levels of catechins (about 576-886 mg) daily for 12-24 weeks modestly improves weight loss when compared to control in overweight individuals or patients with obesity ( 8114 , 37725 , 53906 , 90184 ). A meta-analysis of 25 randomized clinical trials shows that taking green tea extract containing caffeine results in an additional weight loss of 1.8 kg when compared with a control group not taking green tea extract ( 102719 ). In addition, a meta-analysis of clinical trials shows that taking green tea reduces body weight by 0.4 kg in mainly overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes ( 104610 ). Some research also shows that drinking green tea or taking green tea extract containing high levels of catechins but no caffeine reduces weight and visceral fat in overweight individuals or patients with obesity when used for up to 12 weeks ( 53994 , 54039 , 90184 ). In these clinical trials, the following doses have been used: two capsules of green tea extract daily standardized to containing 870 mg of catechins (460 mg EGCG) or 4 cups of green tea daily standardized to contain 928 mg of catechins (440 mg EGCG) for 8 weeks ( 53994 ); a specific decaffeinated green tea extract (Sunphenon 90LB, Taiyo Kagaku Ltd.) 530 mg twice daily for 6 weeks ( 54039 ); catechin-enriched green tea beverages providing 234-886 mg of catechins once or twice daily for approximately 3 months ( 37705 , 53906 , 90184 ); a specific green tea extract (AR25, Exolise, Arkopharma), taken as four capsules standardized to contain 375 mg of catechins (epigallocatechin gallate 270 mg) in two divided doses daily for 12 weeks ( 8114 ). Some research has also shown weight loss benefits of multi-ingredient products or diets containing green tea. Multi-ingredient products have included an herbal mixture of garcinia extract 650 mg, green tea extract 100 mg, coffee extract 75 mg, and banaba extract 25 mg per tablet (IQP-GC-101, InQpharm Europe Ltd.) 30 minutes before meals twice daily for 12 weeks ( 90137 ) and a specific product (Sanavita Industry, Piracicaba) containing powdered green tea (40 mg of caffeine), orange pulp, vitamin C, zinc, and selenium, taken as 20 grams in two divided doses daily for 8 weeks ( 90134 ). Drinking green tea has also been used as part of a Mediterranean diet also including Wolffia globose ( 109888 ). However, many studies show conflicting results ( 37715 , 37753 , 54035 , 98419 , 98420 , 98422 ). Reasons for these inconsistent findings are not entirely clear, but may relate to the use of decaffeinated green tea products, the use of green tea products containing low catechin amounts, or the presence and type of concomitant exercise. Some research shows that green tea extract containing a lower catechin amount (491 mg daily) or decaffeinated green tea products do not improve weight loss when compared with placebo in patients with obesity ( 37753 , 54035 , 98419 ). One meta-analysis of 15 clinical studies including about 1240 patients with obesity shows that using green tea products that are decaffeinated does not improve body weight, body mass index, or waist circumference when compared with control, while green tea products containing catechins 576-714 mg daily and caffeine do improve these outcomes ( 16892 ). Taking green tea after weight loss does not seem to improve weight maintenance when compared with control ( 14428 , 54076 ). Other clinical research shows that green tea does not improve weight loss in individuals with obesity who are already participating in exercise, such as walking and interval sprinting ( 37715 , 98420 ). In contrast, another small clinical study shows that taking green tea 500 mg daily for 10 weeks while participating in HIIT improves weight, body fat percentage, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when compared with either green tea or HIIT alone. However, it appears that the majority of these improvements are due to participation in HIIT ( 100201 ). There is also some limited research in children. One small clinical trial in obese children ages 6-16 years shows that taking green tea providing 576 mg catechins daily for 24 weeks modestly reduces waist circumference, as well as systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, when compared with taking green tea providing 75 mg catechins daily. However, there were no significant difference between groups for other anthropometric measures or cardiovascular risk factors ( 37743 ). Another clinical trial in obese females ages 6-10 years who were also given diet and exercise advice shows that taking decaffeinated green tea polyphenols 400 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fat mass, but does not affect other anthropometric measures, when compared with placebo. Also, taking green tea polyphenols modestly reduces ovary volume, but has no effect on other measures of early puberty, such as breast development, uterine volume, or levels of sex hormones ( 107162 ). more Oral cancer. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for oral cancer prevention. Meta-analyses of epidemiological research suggest that the highest intake of green tea is associated with a 20% to 29% reduction in risk of oral cancer when compared with the lowest intake ( 90180 , 102716 ). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients with high-risk oral premalignant lesions shows that taking a green tea extract 500-1000 mg/m2 three times daily after meals for 12 weeks increases the rate of clinical and histological response when compared with placebo ( 53936 ). more Oral leukoplakia. It is unclear if drinking green tea and concomitantly applying topical green tea to lesions is beneficial for oral leukoplakia. Preliminary clinical research in patients with oral leukoplakia shows that drinking 3 grams of a mixed tea product containing green tea daily for 6 months, while also topically applying a 10% mixed tea product in the mouth three times daily, reduces oral lesion size by about 38%, compared with a 3% increase in those taking placebo. It is not clear if this effect is due to green tea, the other ingredients, or the combination ( 4213 ). more Osteopenia. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing osteopenia. Population research suggests that drinking green tea for 10 years is associated with increased bone mineral density ( 8116 ). Other population research suggests that drinking less than one cup of green tea daily is associated with an 81% to 85% increased odds of having osteopenia when compared with drinking green tea 1-3 times daily ( 111026 ). Preliminary clinical research in postmenopausal adults with osteopenia shows that taking capsules containing green tea polyphenols 500 mg (233 mg as epigallocatechin-3-gallate or EGCG) daily, possibly while practicing tai chi 60 minutes three times weekly, for 24 weeks improves serum markers of bone turnover and muscle strength when compared to baseline ( 54040 ). However, the results from this study are limited by a lack of control group and the fact that diagnostic measures of bone health, such as T-score or Z-score, were not assessed. more Osteoporosis. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing osteoporosis. Population research suggests that drinking green tea for 10 years is associated with increased bone mineral density ( 8116 ). Other population research suggests that drinking less than one cup of green tea daily is associated with up to a 91% increased odds of having osteoporosis when compared with drinking green tea 1-3 times daily ( 111026 ). More recent clinical research shows that taking decaffeinated green tea extract supplying approximately 1315 mg of catechins (843 mg as EGCG) daily does not improve bone mineral density, T-score, or Z-score in postmenopausal adults ( 98419 ). more Overall mortality. Some population research suggests that drinking green tea may reduce the risk of overall mortality by a small amount. A meta-analysis of population research in Japanese adults found that drinking at least 5 cups of green tea daily is associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality when compared with drinking less than 1 cup daily ( 102002 ). Another meta-analysis of population research found that each one cup per day increase in green tea consumption is associated with a 3% reduced risk of all-cause mortality ( 102728 ). However, more recent population research has found that although drinking green tea is associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality in patients with a previous MI and stroke, drinking as much as 7 cups of green tea daily is not associated with a reduced odds of all-cause mortality over a median of 18.5 years in individuals with no history of stroke or MI when compared with not drinking green tea ( 107160 ). more Pancreatic cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for pancreatic cancer prevention. A meta-analysis of population research suggests that the highest intake of green tea is not associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer when compared with the lowest intake ( 102716 ). However, one epidemiological study suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer ( 54096 ). more Parkinson disease. Although consuming caffeinated beverages might reduce the risk of developing Parkinson disease, it is unclear if oral green tea prevents or improves symptoms in people with this condition. There is some evidence from large-scale epidemiological studies that the incidence of Parkinson disease decreases with increased consumption of caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea, and cola. For men, the effects seem to be dose related. Men consuming a total of 421-2716 mg of caffeine (approximately 5-33 cups of tea) from any source daily seem to have the greatest reduction in risk. However, there seems to be a significant reduction in risk even with consumption of as little as 124-208 mg caffeine daily (approximately one to three cups tea) ( 6022 ). In females, the effects do not seem to be dose related. Moderate consumption of approximately 1-4 cups daily seems to provide the most reduction in risk ( 1238 ). It is unclear if consuming green tea is more or less effective than other caffeinated beverages for reducing Parkinson disease risk. more Periodontitis. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for improving oral health or improving periodontal disease. Epidemiological research has found that intake of green tea is inversely associated with symptoms of periodontal disease, including probing depth, attachment loss, and bleeding on probing ( 53844 ). A small clinical trial shows that taking green tea extract 1.55% by weight in chewable candy for 28 days appears to reduce plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation ( 7594 ). A small clinical trial in patients with chronic periodontitis shows that applying a gel containing green tea extract 1 gram/100 mL into the periodontal pocket as an adjunct to scaling improves gingivitis, periodontal disease, and clinical attachment by 7%, 112%, and 116%, respectively, when compared with placebo gel ( 90135 ). A meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research also shows that use of oral or topical products containing green tea modestly improve clinical attachment when compared with control products, including triclosan toothpaste and placebo. Green tea products included gel, paste, and tea ( 107156 ). more Pneumonia. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for pneumonia prevention. Epidemiological research in Japanese females has found that consuming green tea is associated with a lower risk of death from pneumonia when compared to those who do not drink green tea ( 53897 ). However, other epidemiological research in hospitalized elderly Japanese adults has found that there is no association between green tea consumption during the past month and prevalence of pneumonia at time of hospitalization ( 107161 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for PCOS. A meta-analysis of 4 small clinical trials shows that taking green tea modestly reduces weight in patients with PCOS when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on other endpoints including body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, or waist or hip circumference. Three studies in the meta-analysis used green tea 1000-2000 mg/daily in tablets or capsules; the other study used green tea powder providing epigallocatechin gallate 1620 mg daily ( 111019 ). However, the included studies were small and utilized heterogeneous dosing regimens. Subsequently, a moderate-sized clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking green tea leaf powder, 500 mg twice daily for 1 week followed by 1500 mg daily for 3 months, improves menstrual cycle regularity, but does not reduce BMI or waist or hip circumference, when compared with metformin or placebo ( 114894 ). more Postoperative pain. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with green tea is beneficial for postoperative pain associated with molar removal. In patients undergoing third molar extraction, a small clinical trial shows that using 15 mL of a mouthwash containing green tea extract 5 grams/100 mL twice daily, beginning the day after surgical removal of impacted molars and continuing for 7 days thereafter, reduces pain by 60% and analgesic use during the first three days when compared with using a mouthwash that does not contain green tea ( 90141 ). more Prostate cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea or taking green tea catechins by mouth is beneficial for prostate cancer treatment or prevention. Green tea catechins have been evaluated for reducing prostate cancer risk in high-risk patients ( 14127 , 98421 , 102716 ). A meta-analysis of results from three clinical trials shows that taking green tea catechins 400-600 mg daily for 12-30 months reduces the risk of prostate cancer by approximately 62% when compared with placebo in high-risk patients ( 98421 ). However, another meta-analysis including two of these studies plus one additional does not show that taking green tea catechins reduces the incidence of prostate cancer in high-risk patients ( 102716 ). Most population research has found that drinking higher amounts of green tea is not associated with a reduced risk for prostate cancer when compared with those who never or rarely drink green tea ( 14128 , 54036 , 53741 , 53753 , 90153 , 90181 , 98421 ). However, one meta-analysis of population research found that people who drink very high amounts of green tea (7-15 cups daily) have a 19% to 44% reduced risk of prostate cancer ( 98421 ). Another population study found that higher green tea intake is associated with a reduced risk of advanced, but not overall, prostate cancer risk ( 53753 ). In April 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming green tea may reduce the risk of prostate cancer, although the FDA has concluded that there is very little scientific evidence to support this claim ( 102106 ). Additionally, most clinical research shows that drinking large amounts of green tea or taking green tea extract does not reduce disease progression in patients with prostate cancer ( 11366 , 53726 ). Green tea and green tea catechins have also been evaluated for reducing prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with or at risk of prostate cancer shows that taking green tea or green tea extract for 3 weeks to 12 months does not modify PSA levels when compared with water or placebo. However, sub-analyses suggest that there is significant heterogeneity with respect to findings between geographical locations, with some evidence of benefit in studies conducted in the US ( 107155 ). more Radiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical green tea is beneficial for preventing radiation dermatitis. Preliminary clinical research in patients undergoing radiotherapy after breast cancer surgery shows that spraying epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) over the radiation field prevents the development of at least moderate severity radiation dermatitis by 30% when compared with saline as placebo. Also, occurrence of symptoms was delayed by about 2.7 days and symptom severity was reduced. EGCG 660 mcmol/L was sprayed 3 times daily from the first day of radiation until 2 weeks after completion at 0.05 mL per squared cm ( 111031 ). The interpretation of these results is limited by the unbalanced treatment groups. more Radiation-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for reducing diarrhea associated with radiotherapy. A small clinical trial shows that taking a green tea tablet (Camgreen, Iran Giahessence Pharmacy Co.) 450 mg daily for 5 weeks during pelvic irradiation reduces the frequency of diarrhea in patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment. In the fifth week of treatment, 19% of patients taking green tea had diarrhea, compared with approximately 62% of those taking placebo ( 104614 ). more Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for reducing vomiting associated with radiotherapy. A small clinical trial shows that taking a green tea tablet (Camgreen, Iran Giahessence Pharmacy Co.) 450 mg daily for 5 weeks during pelvic irradiation does not reduce the frequency of vomiting when compared with placebo in patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment ( 104614 ). more Renal cell carcinoma. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing kidney cancer. Epidemiological research suggests that green tea intake is not associated with risk of kidney cancer over a mean of 19 years in Japanese adults. However, in females, consuming at least 5 cups of green tea daily, but not lesser amounts, is associated with a 55% reduced risk of kidney cancer when compared with rare intake ( 111022 ). more Skin cancer. Although there has been interest in using oral or topical green tea for skin cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition. Stress. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for stress reduction. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific brand of green tea extract (Teavigo, DSM) 300 mg orally for 7 days reduces stress and increases calmness when compared with placebo in healthy individuals ( 54055 ). more Stretch marks (striae distensae). It is unclear if topical green tea is beneficial for stretch marks. A small clinical study in young adult females shows that applying a green tea extract 3% cream to stretch marks on the leg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces stretch mark severity when compared to baseline ( 114893 ). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a control group. more Stroke. It is unclear if consumption of green tea is associated with a reduced risk of stroke or with reduced all-cause mortality in patients with a previous stroke. Large-scale population research in Japanese individuals suggests that consuming at least 3-5 cups of green tea daily is associated with a reduced risk of cerebrovascular mortality when compared with drinking less than 1 cup daily. This association appears to be primarily related to a decrease in risk for cerebral infarction or hemorrhage ( 14498 , 54080 , 102002 ). Other population research suggests that drinking 1-3 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 36% reduced odds of stroke when compared with drinking less than 1 cup daily, while drinking 4 or more cups daily has no effect. Also, green tea consumption was not associated with reduced incidence of cerebral hemorrhage or infarction in this study ( 97134 ). Meta-analyses of population research suggest that an increase of 1 cup per day in green tea consumption is associated with a 6% reduced risk of stroke or cerebral hemorrhage ( 102728 , 111021 ). A prospective, observational study also suggests that higher intake of tea, including green and black tea, of at least 2 cups daily is associated with a 16% reduced risk of stroke when compared with not drinking tea. This study also found that drinking 2-3 cups daily of each tea and coffee is associated with a 38% reduced risk of stroke when compared with not drinking tea and coffee. The combination of 0.5-1 cups of coffee and 2-3 cups of tea daily, but not tea alone, was associated with a 50% reduced risk of post-stroke dementia when compared with not drinking tea and coffee ( 107204 ). In patients with a previous stroke, drinking at least 3 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 48% to 62% reduced odds of all-cause mortality over a median of 18.5 years when compared with not drinking green tea ( 107160 ). more Sunburn. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for preventing ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema. A meta-analysis of three small clinical trials shows that taking green tea catechins 540-1402 mg daily for 6 to 12 weeks has a small to moderate protective effect against ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema when compared with placebo, especially at lower doses of ultraviolet radiation. A single topical dose of green tea ingredients may also be beneficial, but data is limited ( 107153 ). more Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for SLE. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking green tea extract 500 mg (containing 22% polyphenols) twice daily for 3 months modestly improves disease activity, general health, and vitality when compared with placebo ( 97136 ). more Tinea pedis. It is unclear if a topical green tea footbath is beneficial for athlete's foot. In bedridden, elderly patients with cognitive deficiency, use of a footbath containing a 0.1% green tea extract for 15 minutes once daily for 12 weeks does not improve symptoms of athlete's foot, but does improve skin condition, when compared with a footbath not containing green tea. The green tea extract Sunphenon BG-3 (Taiyo Kagaku Co. Ltd., Yokkaichi), prepared by dissolving 5 grams of the Sunphenon BG-3 product in 5 liters of water to create a 0.1% green tea solution, was used ( 90151 ). more Tooth extraction. Topical green tea has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small, split-mouth clinical study in patients undergoing third molar extractions shows that applying a gel containing green tea extract 0.5% and hyaluronic acid into the surgical site immediately after extraction and three times daily for 7 days improves some post-operative outcomes, such as reducing exudate or facial edema when compared with placebo ( 114895 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to green tea, hyaluronic acid, or the combination. more Ulcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for ulcerative colitis. Preliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis shows that taking a specific green tea product (Polyphenon E, Mitsui-Norin) 200 mg or 400 mg twice daily for 8 weeks may increase the number of people who respond to therapy and achieve remission when compared with placebo. After treatment, 10 of 15 patients in the green tea extract group responded to therapy and 8 of 15 patients achieved remission, compared with 0 in the placebo group ( 90140 ). more Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if gargling and swallowing green tea is beneficial for reducing URTI symptoms. Preliminary clinical research shows that gargling and swallowing green tea (Morgentau, Ronnefeld KG) 100 mL daily over 4 days is less effective than proprietary labdanum lozenges (CYSTUS052, Dr Pandalis Urheimische Medizin GmbH &amp; Co.) for upper respiratory tract symptoms in patients with URTIs ( 53867 ). more Urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for reducing UTI symptoms. A small clinical study in females with acute uncomplicated cystitis shows that adding green tea 2000 mg daily for 3 days to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole reduces symptoms of cystitis when compared with placebo ( 99799 ). This study is limited by its small size and the lack of information on antibiotic resistance in each treatment group. more Wrinkled skin. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for wrinkles. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking green tea catechins 175 mg twice daily for two years does not reduce signs of photo-aging of the skin in females with facial photo-aging when compared with placebo ( 53873 ). However, using a combination of topical green tea 10% cream and oral green tea extract 300 mg twice daily for 8 weeks seems to improve skin elasticity in females with moderate photo-aging based on microscopic analysis, although the clinical appearance of the skin does not seem to significantly improve ( 53731 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that consuming one liter of a beverage with green tea polyphenols for 12 weeks improves skin elasticity, roughness, and hydration in middle-aged females when compared with placebo ( 54030 ). more More evidence is needed to rate green tea for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when green tea is consumed as a beverage in moderate amounts ( 733 , 6031 , 9222 , 9223 , 9225 , 9226 , 9227 , 9228 , 14136 , 90156 )( 90159 , 90168 , 90174 , 90184 , 95696 ). Green tea contains caffeine. According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, drinking up to 8 cups of green tea daily, or approximately 400 mg of caffeine, is not associated with significant adverse cardiovascular, bone, behavioral, or reproductive effects in healthy adults ( 11733 , 98806 ). The US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee states that there is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of caffeine 400 mg daily is not associated with increased risk of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer, in healthy adults ( 98806 ). ...when green tea extract cream or ointment is used topically and appropriately, short-term. A green tea extract 3% cream, applied twice daily, has been used with apparent safety for up to 8 weeks, and a specific green tea extract ointment (Veregen, Bradley Pharmaceuticals) providing 15% kunecatechins has been safely used for up to 16 weeks ( 15067 ). The safety of treatment for longer durations or multiple treatment courses is not known. Possibly Safe when green tea extract is used orally. Green tea extract containing 7% to 12% caffeine has been used safely for up to 2 years ( 8117 , 37725 ). Also decaffeinated green tea extract up to 1.3 grams daily enriched in EGCG has been used safely for up to 12 months ( 90158 , 97131 ). In addition, green tea extract has been safely used as part of an herbal mixture also containing garcinia, coffee, and banaba extracts for 12 weeks ( 90137 ). ...when used topically and appropriately as a cream or mouthwash ( 6065 , 11310 , 90141 , 90150 , 90151 ). Possibly Unsafe when consumed as a beverage in large quantities. Green tea contains a significant amount of caffeine. Chronic use, especially in large amounts, can produce tolerance, habituation, psychological dependence, and other significant adverse effects. Doses of caffeine greater than 600 mg per day, or approximately 12 cups of green tea, have been associated with significant adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmias and sleep disturbances ( 11832 ). These effects would not be expected to occur with the consumption of decaffeinated green tea. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as green tea, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product. There is also some speculation that green tea products containing higher amounts of the catechin epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) might have increased risk of adverse events. Some research has found that taking green tea products containing EGCG levels greater than 200 mg is associated with increased risk of mild adverse effects such as constipation, increased blood pressure, and rash ( 90161 ). Other research has found that doses of EGCG equal to or above 800 mg daily may be associated with increased risk of liver injury in humans ( 95440 , 95696 , 97131 ). Likely Unsafe when used orally in very high doses. The fatal acute oral dose of caffeine is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg per kilogram). Serious toxicity can occur at lower doses depending on variables in caffeine sensitivity such as smoking, age, and prior caffeine use ( 11832 ). CHILDREN: Possibly Safe when used orally by children and adolescents in amounts commonly found in foods and beverages ( 4912 , 11833 ). Intake of caffeine in doses of less than 2.5 mg/kg daily is not associated with significant adverse effects in children and adolescents ( 11733 , 98806 ). ...when used for gargling three times daily for up to 90 days ( 90150 ). CHILDREN: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of green tea extract when used orally in children. However, taking green tea extract orally has been associated with potentially serious, albeit uncommon and unpredictable cases, of hepatotoxicity in adults. Therefore, some experts recommend that children under the age of 18 years of age do not use products containing green tea extract ( 94897 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Safe when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of green tea, pregnant patients should closely monitor their intake to ensure moderate consumption. Fetal blood concentrations of caffeine approximate maternal concentrations ( 4260 ). The use of caffeine during pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects ( 2708 , 2709 , 2710 , 2711 , 9606 , 11733 , 16014 , 16015 , 98806 ). In some studies consuming amounts over 200 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage ( 16014 ). This increased risk may be most likely to occur in those with genotypes that confer a slow rate of caffeine metabolism ( 98806 ). According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, most healthy pregnant patients can safely consume doses up to 300 mg daily without an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, fetal growth retardation, or congenital malformations ( 11733 , 98806 ). Advise keeping caffeine consumption below 300 mg daily. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 6 cups of green tea. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as green tea, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product. Based on animal models, green tea extract catechins are also transferred to the fetus, but in amounts 50-100 times less than maternal concentrations ( 15010 ). The potential impact of these catechins on the human fetus is not known, but animal models suggest that the catechins are not teratogenic ( 15011 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in amounts providing more than 300 mg caffeine daily. Caffeine from green tea crosses the placenta, producing fetal blood concentrations similar to maternal levels ( 4260 ). Consumption of caffeine in amounts over 300 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage in some studies ( 16014 , 98806 ). Advise keeping caffeine consumption from all sources below 300 mg daily. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 6 cups of green tea. High maternal doses of caffeine throughout pregnancy have also resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants ( 9891 ). High doses of caffeine have also been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight ( 2709 , 2711 ). However, some research has also found that intrauterine exposure to even modest amounts of caffeine, based on maternal blood levels during the first trimester, is associated with a shorter stature in children ages 4-8 years ( 109846 ). Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as green tea, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product. PREGNANCY: There is also concern that consuming large amounts of green tea might have antifolate activity and potentially increase the risk of folic acid deficiency-related birth defects. Catechins in green tea inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase in vitro ( 15012 ). This enzyme is responsible for converting folic acid to its active form. Preliminary evidence suggests that increasing maternal green tea consumption is associated with increased risk of spina bifida ( 15068 ). Also, evidence from epidemiological research suggests that serum folate levels in pregnant patients with high green tea intake (57.3 mL per 1000 kcal) are decreased compared to participants who consume moderate or low amounts of green tea ( 90171 ). More evidence is needed to determine the safety of using green tea during pregnancy. For now, advise pregnant patients to avoid consuming large quantities of green tea. LACTATION: Possibly Safe when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of green tea, nursing parents should closely monitor caffeine intake. Breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be approximately 50% of maternal serum concentrations ( 9892 ). LACTATION: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in large amounts. Consumption of green tea might cause irritability and increased bowel activity in nursing infants ( 6026 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of green tea extracts when applied topically during breast-feeding.</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: Green tea has most often been used as a beverage, a powder, or an extract. Doses of green tea generally provide up to 2500 mg catechins or 700 mg of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) daily. Isolated catechins have also been used. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Green tea extract and beverages are often standardized to total catechin or EGCG content. Green tea beverages are typically standardized to contain 178-823 mg of total catechins per cup ( 53987 , 53994 , 53995 , 54030 , 90156 , 90168 , 90174 , 90175 , 90184 ). Green tea extracts are typically standardized to contain about 85% to 95% or 400-450 mg of total catechins per capsule ( 53994 , 53995 , 54035 , 54039 , 90139 , 90140 , 90145 ). They are also sometimes standardized to 15% to 97% EGCG ( 54039 , 54055 , 90137 , 90145 , 90158 ). While rare, some research suggests that green tea extracts are associated with hepatotoxicity. To minimize this risk, green tea extracts should be taken with food ( 102722 ). Drinking green tea may reduce the absorption of iron from plant foods ( 631 , 8110 , 9237 , 111644 ). While this interaction is unlikely to be clinically meaningful in most individuals, advise patients with low iron stores to separate intake of green tea from meals. Additionally, certain foods may reduce the absorption of active green tea constituents. Some clinical evidence suggests that consuming green tea extract in conjunction with soy protein reduces catechin bioavailability ( 90957 ). Advise patients to separate dosing of green tea and soy protein products by at least 3 hours. There is also some concern that milk may reduce the absorption of green tea polyphenols ( 220 , 6032 , 15219 , 36557 , 36594 ). However, this interaction is unlikely to be clinically significant. Topical: Topically, green tea has been used in a solution, footbath, ointment, or gel. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Children Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Standardization &amp; Formulation Various green tea products and extracts have been examined in clinical trials. Green tea, green tea beverages, and green tea extracts are typically standardized to polyphenol or total catechin content. The commonly used dose of green tea, which is about 3 cups per day, provides 240-480 mg of polyphenols ( 53867 ). Green teas used in clinical research have been standardized to contain 178-823 mg of total catechins per cup ( 53994 , 53995 , 90156 , 90168 , 90174 , 90184 ). Green tea-containing beverages used in clinical research have been standardized to contain about 400 mg of total catechins per cup of green tea beverage ( 53987 , 54030 ), or 302 mg of EGCG per cup ( 90175 ). Supplements containing green tea extract have been standardized to contain about 400-450 mg of total catechins per capsule ( 53994 , 53995 , 54035 , 54039 ). One product contained 187.5 mg polyphenols, 125 mg EGCG, and 20 mg caffeine per 250 mg extract ( 98420 ). A specific decaffeinated green tea extract supplement (Teavigo, DSM) has been standardized to contain 94% to 97% EGCG ( 54055 , 90158 ). A green tea footbath used in a clinical trial was made using a specific green tea extract Sunphenon BG-3 (Taiyo Kagaku Co. Ltd.), which was standardized to a total catechin content 89.1% with an EGCG content of 48.8% and an epigallocatechin (EGC) content of 17.8%. The footbath was prepared by dissolving 5 grams of Sunphenon BG-3 in 15 mL glycerin, then diluting the solution in 5 liters of water to create a 0.1% green tea solution ( 90151 ). A specific green tea extract (Polyphenon E), has been used in various clinical trials ( 90139 , 90140 , 90145 ). Polyphenon E contains 85% to 95% total catechins, with 56% to 72% as EGCG. Capsules are standardized to contain 200 mg of EGCG per capsule ( 90145 ). A specific product (Herbal One Green Tea Extract, Herbal One Co., Ltd.) containing 250 mg of green tea extract per capsule has been standardized to contain gallic acid 0.24 mg, catechin 4.09 mg, caffeine 28.86 mg, EGCG 33.58 mg, and epicatechin gallate 9.28 mg ( 37725 ). A specific decaffeinated green tea extract product (Sunphenon 90LB, Taiyo Kagaku Ltd) containing decaffeinated green tea extract 530 mg per capsule has been standardized to contain EGCG 40.71%, epigallocatechin (EGC) 16.27%, epicatechin 8.74%, epicatechin gallate 6.02%, gallocatechin 2.02%, gallocatechin gallate 1.27%, catechin 1.16%, gallic acid 0.75%, and catechin gallate 0.03% ( 54039 ). One type of green tea extract (Thea-Flan 90S, ITO EN Ltd.) provided catechin 336.4 mg and caffeine 2.7 mg per three capsules. The catechins included EGCG 216.9 mg, epicatechin gallate 96.4 mg, epigallocatechin 3.2 mg, epicatechin 1.7 mg, gallocatechin gallate 12.5 mg, catechin gallate 4.0 mg, gallocatechin 1.0 mg, and catechin 0.8 mg ( 104603 ).</data><data key="interactions_text">Expand All | Collapse All 5-FLUOROURACIL Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, high doses of green tea might increase the effects and side effects of 5-fluorouracil. Animal research shows that taking green tea in amounts equivalent to about 6 cups daily in humans for 4 weeks prior to receiving a single injection of 5-fluorouracil increases the maximum plasma levels of 5-fluorouracil by about 2.5-fold and the area under the curve by 425% ( 98424 ). more ADENOSINE (Adenocard) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, green tea might decrease the vasodilatory effects of adenosine and interfere with its use prior to stress testing. Green tea contains caffeine. Caffeine is a competitive inhibitor of adenosine at the cellular level. However, caffeine doesn't seem to affect supplemental adenosine because high interstitial levels of adenosine overcome the antagonistic effects of caffeine ( 11771 ). It is recommended that methylxanthines and methylxanthine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests ( 11770 ). However, methylxanthines appear more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine-induced stress testing ( 11771 ). more ALCOHOL (Ethanol) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, alcohol might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Concomitant use of alcohol and caffeine can increase caffeine serum concentrations and the risk of caffeine adverse effects. Alcohol reduces caffeine metabolism ( 6370 ). more ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. Conflicting reports exist regarding the effect of green tea on bleeding risk when used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs; however, most evidence suggests that drinking green tea in moderate amounts is unlikely to cause a significant interaction. Green tea contains small amounts of vitamin K, approximately 7 mcg per cup ( 100524 ). Some case reports have associated the antagonism of warfarin with the vitamin K content of green tea ( 1460 , 1461 , 1463 , 4211 , 6048 , 8028 , 20868 ). However, these reports are rare, and very large doses of green tea (about 8-16 cups daily) appear to be needed to cause these effects. Furthermore, the catechins and caffeine in green tea are reported to have antiplatelet activity ( 733 , 8028 , 8029 , 12882 , 100524 ). more ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, taking green tea with antidiabetes drugs might interfere with blood glucose control. Concomitant use of green tea and antidiabetes drugs might interfere with blood glucose control. The data are conflicting. Reports claim that green tea and/or caffeine, a constituent of green tea, might increase or decrease blood sugar ( 6024 , 8646 , 54011 , 54035 , 54068 , 90154 ). more ATORVASTATIN (Lipitor) Interaction Rating Major Do not take this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence LIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Green tea extract seems to reduce the levels and clinical effects of atorvastatin. In healthy humans, taking green tea extract 300 mg or 600 mg along with atorvastatin reduces plasma levels of atorvastatin by approximately 24%. The elimination of atorvastatin is not affected ( 102714 ). Atorvastatin is a substrate of organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs). Research shows that two of the major catechins found in green tea, epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), inhibit OATPs. Some OATPs are expressed in the small intestine and are responsible for the uptake of drugs and other compounds, which may have resulted in reduced plasma levels of atorvastatin ( 19079 ). It is not clear if drinking green tea alters the absorption of atorvastatin. more BETA-ADRENERGIC AGONISTS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Green tea contains caffeine. Theoretically, concomitant use of large amounts of caffeine might increase cardiac inotropic effects of beta-agonists ( 15 ). BORTEZOMIB (Velcade) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might interfere with the effects of bortezomib. In vitro research shows that green tea polyphenols, such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), interact with bortezomib and block its proteasome inhibitory action. This prevents the induction of cell death in multiple myeloma or glioblastoma cancer cell lines ( 17212 ). Advise patients taking bortezomib, not to take green tea. more CARBAMAZEPINE (Tegretol) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the effects of carbamazepine and increase the risk for convulsions. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that taking caffeine can lower the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine and can induce seizures when taken in doses above 400 mg/kg ( 23559 , 23561 ). Human research has shown that taking caffeine 300 mg in three divided doses along with carbamazepine 200 mg reduces the bioavailability of carbamazepine by 32% and prolongs the plasma half-life of carbamazepine 2-fold in healthy individuals ( 23562 ). more CELIPROLOL (Celicard) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the levels and clinical effects of celiprolol. In a small human study, taking green tea daily for 4 days appears to decrease blood and urine levels of celiprolol by at least 98% ( 104607 ). This interaction is possibly due to the inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP). Green tea catechins have been shown to inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP), one of which, OATP1A2, is found in the intestine ( 19079 , 19080 , 98461 ) The interaction is thought to be due primarily to the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) content of green tea ( 98461 ). more CIMETIDINE (Tagamet) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence LIKELY Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the effects and adverse effects of caffeine in green tea. Green tea contains caffeine. Cimetidine can reduce caffeine clearance by 31% to 42% ( 11736 ). more CLOZAPINE (Clozaril) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, green tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of clozapine and acutely exacerbate psychotic symptoms. Animal research suggests that, although green tea extract does not affect the elimination of clozapine, it delays the time to reach peak concentration and reduces the peak plasma levels ( 90173 ). Also, concomitant administration of green tea and clozapine might theoretically cause acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms due to the caffeine in green tea. Caffeine can increase the effects and toxicity of clozapine. Caffeine doses of 400-1000 mg daily inhibit clozapine metabolism ( 5051 ). Clozapine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). Researchers speculate that caffeine might inhibit CYP1A2. However, there is no reliable evidence that caffeine affects CYP1A2. There is also speculation that genetic factors might make some patients be more sensitive to the interaction between clozapine and caffeine ( 13741 ). more CONTRACEPTIVE DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the effects and adverse effects of caffeine found in green tea. Green tea contains caffeine. Oral contraceptives can decrease caffeine clearance by 40% to 65% ( 8644 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) INHIBITORS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Caffeine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) ( 3941 , 5051 , 11741 , 23557 , 23573 , 23580 , 24958 , 24959 , 24960 , 24962 ), ( 24964 , 24965 , 24967 , 24968 , 24969 , 24971 , 38081 , 48603 ). Theoretically, drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 may decrease the clearance rate of caffeine from green tea and increase caffeine levels. more CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Green tea is unlikely to produce clinically significant changes in the levels and clinical effects of CYP3A4 substrates. In vitro and in vivo research suggests that green tea can inhibit intestinal CYP3A and induce hepatic CYP3A4 enzymes ( 20896 , 53747 , 53835 , 90170 ). However, this effect is unlikely to be clinically significant, as green tea does not appear to affect CYP3A4 activity in humans ( 14429 , 90170 ). more DIPYRIDAMOLE (Persantine) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, green tea might decrease the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole and interfere with its use prior to stress testing. Green tea contains caffeine. Caffeine might inhibit dipyridamole-induced vasodilation ( 11770 , 11772 ). It is recommended that methylxanthines and methylxanthine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests ( 11770 ). Methylxanthines appear more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine-induced stress testing ( 11771 ). more DISULFIRAM (Antabuse) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, disulfiram might increase the risk of adverse effects from caffeine. In human research, disulfiram decreases the clearance and increases the half-life of caffeine ( 11840 ). more DIURETIC DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, using green tea with diuretic drugs might increase the risk of hypokalemia. Green tea contains caffeine. In excessive amounts, caffeine can reduce potassium levels due to stimulation of the sodium-potassium pump ( 23579 , 37905 , 37953 , 38003 , 38034 ). Diuretics can also cause lower potassium levels. more EPHEDRINE Interaction Rating Major Do not take this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the risk for stimulant adverse effects. Green tea contains caffeine. There is evidence that using ephedrine with caffeine might increase the risk of serious life-threatening or debilitating adverse effects such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, seizures, and death ( 6486 , 10307 ). more ESTROGENS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, estrogens might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Estrogen inhibits caffeine metabolism ( 2714 ). more ETHOSUXIMIDE (Zarontin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the effects of ethosuximide and increase the risk for convulsions. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that caffeine 92.4 mg/kg can decrease the anticonvulsant activity of ethosuximide ( 23560 ). However, this effect has not been reported in humans. more FELBAMATE (Felbatol) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the effects of felbamate and increase the risk for convulsions. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that a high dose of caffeine 161.7 mg/kg can decreases the anticonvulsant activity of felbamate ( 23563 ). However, this effect has not been reported in humans. more FEXOFENADINE (Allegra) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Green tea can decrease blood levels of fexofenadine. Clinical research shows that green tea can significantly decrease blood levels and excretion of fexofenadine. Taking green tea extract with a dose of fexofenadine decreased bioavailability of fexofenadine by about 30%. In vitro, green tea inhibits the cellular accumulation of fexofenadine by inhibiting the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) drug transporter ( 111029 ). Research shows that two of the major catechins found in green tea, epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), inhibit OATPs, specifically OATP1A2, OATP1B1, and OATP2B1. In addition, green tea has been shown to reduce the absorption of some drugs that are OATP substrates ( 19079 , 102714 , 102730 ). more FLUCONAZOLE (Diflucan) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, fluconazole might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine.

Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of flutamide. Green tea contains caffeine. In vitro evidence suggests that caffeine can inhibit the metabolism of flutamide ( 23553 ). Theoretically, concomitant use of caffeine and flutamide might increase serum concentrations of flutamide and increase the risk adverse effects. more FLUVOXAMINE (Luvox) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, fluvoxamine might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine.

Severity HIGH Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, concomitant use might have additive adverse hepatotoxic effects. Green tea extract supplements have been linked to several cases of hepatotoxicity and might have additive hepatotoxic effects with other drugs. ( 14136 , 14310 , 53740 , 53742 , 53746 , 53752 , 53775 , 54016 , 15026 , 54027 )( 93256 , 102722 , 111644 ). more IMATINIB (Gleevec) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the levels and clinical effects of imatinib. In animal research, a single dose of green tea extract reduces the area under the curve (AUC) of imatinib by up to approximately 64% and its main metabolite N-desmethyl imatinib by up to approximately 81% ( 104600 ). This interaction has not been shown in humans. The mechanism of action is unclear but may involve multiple pathways. more LISINOPRIL Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Case-control study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the levels and clinical effects of lisinopril. Preliminary clinical research shows that a single dose of green tea extract reduces plasma concentrations of lisinopril. Compared to a control group, peak levels and area under the curve (AUC) of lisinopril were reduced by approximately 71% and 66%, respectively ( 104599 ). This may be due to inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) by green tea catechins ( 19079 , 19080 , 98461 ) The interaction is thought to be due primarily to the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) content of green tea ( 98461 ). more LITHIUM Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, abrupt green tea withdrawal might increase the levels and adverse effects of lithium. Green tea contains caffeine. Abrupt caffeine withdrawal can increase serum lithium levels ( 609 ). Two cases of lithium tremor that worsened with abrupt coffee withdrawal have been reported ( 610 ). more METFORMIN (Glucophage) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, metformin might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that metformin can reduce caffeine metabolism ( 23571 ). Theoretically, concomitant use can increase caffeine serum concentrations and the risk of caffeine adverse effects. more METHOXSALEN (Oxsoralen) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, methoxsalen might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Methoxsalen can reduce caffeine metabolism ( 23572 ). Concomitant use can increase caffeine serum concentrations and the risk of caffeine adverse effects. more MEXILETINE (Mexitil) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, mexiletine might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Mexiletine can decrease caffeine elimination by 50% ( 1260 ). more MIDAZOLAM (Versed) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of midazolam. Animal research suggests that green tea extract can increase the maximum plasma concentration, but not the half-life, of oral midazolam. This effect has been attributed to the inhibition of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and induction of hepatic CYP3A4 enzymes by green tea constituents ( 20896 ). However, it is unlikely that this effect is clinically significant, as the dose used in animals was 50 times greater than what is commonly ingested by humans. more MONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITORS (MAOIs) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the risk of a hypertensive crisis. Green tea contains caffeine. Caffeine has been shown to inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B in laboratory studies ( 37724 , 37877 , 37912 , 38108 ). Concomitant intake of large amounts of caffeine with MAOIs might precipitate a hypertensive crisis ( 15 ). In a case report, a patient that consumed 10-12 cups of caffeinated coffee and took the MAOI tranylcypromine presented with severe hypertension ( 91086 ). Hypertension was resolved after the patient switched to drinking decaffeinated coffee. more NADOLOL (Corgard) Interaction Rating Major Do not take this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence LIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Green tea seems to reduce the levels and clinical effects of nadolol. Preliminary clinical research shows that green tea consumption reduces plasma concentrations of nadolol. Compared to a control group, both peak levels and total drug exposure (AUC) of nadolol were reduced by approximately 85% in subjects who drank green tea daily for two weeks. Drinking green tea with nadolol also significantly reduced nadolol's systolic blood pressure lowering effect ( 19071 ). Other clinical research shows that a single dose of green tea can affect plasma nadolol levels for at least one hour ( 102721 ). Green tea catechins have been shown to inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP), one of which, OATP1A2, is involved in the uptake of nadolol in the intestine ( 19071 , 19079 , 19080 , 98461 ) The interaction is thought to be due primarily to the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) content of green tea ( 98461 ). more NICARDIPINE (Cardene) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of nicardipine. Green tea contains EGCG. Animal research shows that EGCG increases the area under the curve (AUC) and absolute oral bioavailability of nicardipine. The mechanism of action is thought to involve inhibition of both intestinal P-glycoprotein and hepatic cytochrome P450 3A ( 90136 ). The effect of green tea itself on nicardipine is unclear. more NICOTINE Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the risk of hypertension. Green tea contains caffeine. Concomitant use of caffeine and nicotine has been shown to have additive cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate and blood pressure. Blood pressure was increased by 10.8/12.4 mmHg when the agents were used concomitantly ( 36549 ). more NINTEDANIB (Ofev) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Green tea seems to reduce the levels of nintedanib. Clinical research shows that green tea can significantly decrease blood levels of nintedanib. Taking green tea extract twice daily for 7 days 30 minutes prior to a meal along with nintedanib with the meal decreased the 12-hour area under the curve (AUC) values for nintedanib by 21%. There was no effect on the maximum concentration of nintedanib ( 111028 ). more ORGANIC ANION-TRANSPORTING POLYPEPTIDE SUBSTRATES (OATP) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the absorption of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) substrates. OATPs are expressed in the small intestine and liver and are responsible for the uptake of drugs and other compounds. Research shows that two of the major catechins found in green tea, epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), inhibit OATPs, specifically OATP1A2, OATP1B1, and OATP2B1. In addition, green tea has been shown to reduce the absorption of some drugs that are OATP substrates, including lisinopril, and celiprolol ( 19079 , 102714 , 102730 ). more P-GLYCOPROTEIN SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Green tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates. In vitro research and case reports suggest that green tea inhibits drug efflux by P-gp, potentially increasing serum levels of P-gp substrates. Case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describe increased toxicity in patients taking green tea and certain P-gp substrates ( 111644 ). more PENTOBARBITAL (Nembutal) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, green tea might decrease the effects of pentobarbital. Green tea contains caffeine. Theoretically, caffeine might negate the hypnotic effects of pentobarbital ( 13742 ). more PHENOBARBITAL (Luminal) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the effects of phenobarbital and increase the risk for convulsions. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that caffeine can decrease the anticonvulsant activity of phenobarbital ( 23558 , 23559 , 23561 ). The exact mechanism of this interaction is unclear. more PHENOTHIAZINES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, phenothiazines might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Phenothiazines can reduce the metabolism of caffeine by inhibiting cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) ( 23573 , 23574 ). more PHENYLPROPANOLAMINE Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, phenylpropanolamine might increase the risk of hypertension, as well as the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Concomitant use of phenylpropanolamine and caffeine might cause an additive increase in blood pressure ( 11738 ). Phenylpropanolamine also seems to increase caffeine serum levels ( 13743 ). more PHENYTOIN (Dilantin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the effects of phenytoin and increase the risk for convulsions. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that caffeine can decrease the anticonvulsant activity of phenytoin ( 23559 , 23561 ). The effect does not seem to be related to the seizure threshold-lowering effects of caffeine. However, the exact mechanism of this interaction is unclear. more PIOGLITAZONE (Actos) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, green tea might increase the levels and clinical effects of pioglitazone. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that caffeine can modestly increase the maximum concentration, area under the curve, and half-life of pioglitazone, and also reduce its clearance. This increased the antidiabetic effects of pioglitazone ( 108812 ). However, the exact mechanism of this interaction is unclear. more QUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, quinolone antibiotics might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Quinolones (also called fluoroquinolones) can decrease caffeine clearance by inhibiting cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme ( 606 , 607 , 608 , 23554 , 23555 , 23556 ). more RILUZOLE (Rilutek) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the levels and adverse effects of both caffeine and riluzole. Green tea contains caffeine. Caffeine and riluzole are both metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2, and concomitant use might reduce metabolism of one or both agents ( 11739 ). more ROSUVASTATIN (Crestor) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea extract might alter the absorption and distribution of rosuvastatin. In animal research, giving green tea extract with rosuvastatin increased plasma levels of rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin is a substrate of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, which is expressed in the liver. The increased plasma levels may have been related to inhibition of OATP1B1 ( 102717 ). However, in humans, taking EGCG with rosuvastatin reduced plasma levels of rosuvastatin, suggesting an inhibition of intestinal OATP ( 102730 ). It is not clear if drinking green tea alters the absorption of rosuvastatin. more STIMULANT DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence C (Expert opinion) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase stimulant adverse effects. Green tea contains caffeine. Due to the central nervous system (CNS) stimulant effects of caffeine, concomitant use with stimulant drugs can increase the risk of adverse effects ( 11832 ). more TERBINAFINE (Lamisil) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, terbinafine might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of intravenous caffeine by 19% ( 11740 ). more THEOPHYLLINE Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, green tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of theophylline. Green tea contains caffeine. Large amounts of caffeine might inhibit theophylline metabolism ( 11741 ). more TIAGABINE (Gabitril) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of tiagabine. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that chronic caffeine administration can increase the serum concentrations of tiagabine. However, concomitant use does not seem to reduce the antiepileptic effects of tiagabine ( 23561 ). more TICLOPIDINE (Ticlid) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, ticlopidine might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. In vitro evidence suggests that ticlopidine can inhibit caffeine metabolism ( 23557 ). However, this effect has not been reported in humans. more VALPROATE Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the effects of valproate and increase the risk for convulsions. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that caffeine can decrease the anticonvulsant activity of valproate ( 23558 , 23559 , 23561 , 37882 ). However, the exact mechanism of this interaction is unclear. more VERAPAMIL (Calan, others) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the levels and adverse effects of both verapamil and caffeine. Animal research suggests that the green tea constituent EGCG increases the area under the curve (AUC) values for verapamil by up to 111% and its metabolite norverapamil by up to 87%, likely by inhibiting P-glycoprotein ( 90138 ). Also, theoretically, concomitant use of verapamil and caffeinated beverages such as green tea might increase plasma caffeine concentrations and the risk of adverse effects, due to the caffeine contained in green tea. Verapamil increases plasma caffeine concentrations by 25% ( 11741 ). more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, green tea may increase the risk of bleeding if used with warfarin. Conflicting reports exist regarding the potential of green tea to antagonize the effect of warfarin; however, most evidence suggests that drinking green tea in moderation is unlikely to cause a significant interaction. Green tea contains a small amount of vitamin K, approximately 7 mcg per cup ( 100524 ). Some case reports have associated the antagonism of warfarin with the vitamin K content of green tea ( 1460 , 1461 , 1463 , 4211 , 6048 , 8028 , 20868 ). However, these reports are rare, and very large doses of green tea (about 8-16 cups daily) appear to be needed to cause these effects ( 1460 , 1461 , 1463 , 8028 ). Therefore, use of green tea in moderate amounts is unlikely to antagonize the effects of warfarin; however, very large doses should be avoided. more</data><data key="name">Green Tea</data><data key="scientific_name">Camellia sinensis (synonyms: Camellia thea, Camellia theifera, Thea bohea, Thea sinensis, Thea viridis)</data><data key="overview_text">Camellia sinensis is a woody plant.

Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, taking gymnema with antidiabetes drugs might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Gymnema reduces blood glucose levels in some human and animal research. In human studies, it has been shown to enhance the blood glucose lowering effects of hypoglycemic drugs ( 45 , 46 , 92119 , 92121 , 92123 ). However, other research in adults with prediabetes or metabolic syndrome suggests that gymnema does not reduce fasting levels of blood glucose ( 96235 , 105346 ). Until more is known, monitor blood glucose levels closely. more CYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, gymnema might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2. Animal and in vitro research shows that gymnema can inhibit the CYP1A2 enzyme ( 96236 , 96237 , 96238 ). In one animal study, oral administration of gymnema for 7 days increased the plasma concentrations of phenacetin, a CYP1A2 substrate, by about 1.4-fold and reduced the clearance of phenacetin by about 29% ( 96237 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, gymnema might increase or decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C9. Animal research shows that gymnema can induce the CYP2C9 enzyme. In one animal study, gymnema caused a 2.4-fold increase in the clearance of tolbutamide, a CYP2C9 substrate, in rats ( 96237 ). In vitro research also shows that gymnema can inhibit CYP2C9 ( 96236 , 96238 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, gymnema might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. One in vitro study using rat liver microsomes shows that gymnema can modestly inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme ( 96238 ). However, other in vitro research using human liver microsomes shows that gymnema does not affect CYP3A4 activity ( 96236 ). Animal research also shows that gymnema does not alter the function of CYP3A4. In one study in rats, oral administration of gymnema for 7 days did not alter the clearance of amlodipine, a CYP3A4 substrate ( 96237 ). more PHENACETIN Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, taking gymnema with phenacetin might increase the levels of phenacetin. Animal research shows that gymnema, administered orally for 7 days, decreases the clearance of phenacetin in a dose-dependent manner by about 21% to 29% and increases plasma levels about 1.3- to 1.4-fold when compared to control ( 96237 , 96238 ). more TOLBUTAMIDE (Orinase) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, taking gymnema with tolbutamide might the decrease levels of tolbutamide. Animal research shows that gymnema, administered orally for 7 days, increases the clearance of tolbutamide by 2.4-fold when compared to control ( 96237 ). more</data><data key="mechanism_text">General The applicable parts of gymnema are the leaves and roots ( 92121 ). The leaves contain oleanane and dammarane triterpene saponins. These are the primary constituents responsible for gymnema's effects ( 92120 , 92121 ). Oleanane triterpenes include gymnemic acids and gymnemasaponins. Dammarane triterpenes include gymnemasides ( 54561 , 54582 , 95005 ). The largest amount of gymnemic acid is found in the shoot tips. Anthraquinones, flavonoids, tartaric acid, formic acid, butyric acid, gumarin, gymnemagenol, gymnemanol, gymmestrogenin quercitol, stigmasterol, alkaloids, and beta-amyrin related glycosides are also found in gymnema ( 12549 , 54561 , 54581 , 92121 , 92122 , 92123 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Animal research shows that gymnema leaf extract has anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-inflammatory effects of gymnema extract are attributed to saponin, tannin, and steroid constituents ( 92121 ). Antimicrobial effects In vitro research shows that gymnema extract has antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus but not E. coli and Proteus vulgaris ( 14861 , 92121 ). Hypoglycemic effects Gymnema extracts lower blood glucose in animal models and humans with diabetes ( 45 , 46 ). However, fasting levels of blood glucose are not reduced in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or metabolic syndrome ( 96235 , 105346 ). Gymnemic acids seem to reduce intestinal absorption of glucose and may stimulate pancreatic beta-cell growth ( 47 , 48 , 11367 ). Other research suggests that constituents of gymnema have a direct effect on beta-cell function, increasing the release of insulin ( 12549 ). Gymnema can increase serum C-peptide levels, suggesting an increase in endogenous insulin secretion ( 45 ). Immunomodulatory effects Laboratory research shows that a methanolic extract of gymnema can stimulate nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) from peritoneal macrophages, in a concentration dependent manner. A lower concentration of extract appears to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation, while a higher concentration is needed for production of ROS and NO. Gymnemic acid also appears to stimulate splenic T and B cell proliferation. Higher immunomodulatory activity was seen when the extract was combined with other immunostimulatory substances, such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) ( 92120 ). Lipid effects Gymnema leaf extract has been shown to lower serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in animal models of hyperlipidemia ( 54578 , 54579 , 92119 ). However, these effects have not been shown in human research ( 105346 ). Some animal research shows that gymnemic acid, a constituent of gymnema leaf extract, can inhibit the intestinal absorption of the fatty acid oleic acid; this may be one mechanism by which gymnema lowers cholesterol ( 54580 ). Other animal research shows that gymnemic acids may reduce cholesterol levels by increasing fecal cholesterol excretion ( 94670 ). In animal models of metabolic syndrome, gymnema seems to decrease weight gain and triglycerides but does not affect serum cholesterol ( 14859 ). Taste effects Gymnemic acid and gurmarin, constituents of gymnema, inhibit the ability to taste bitter (quinine) or sweet (sugar) flavors, without affecting the ability to taste sour, astringent, or pungent flavors ( 11292 , 92121 ). Two clinical studies show that taking a mint tablet containing gymnemic acids reduces the consumption of sweet foods (i.e., chocolate bars) when compared with placebo; this effect is theoretically due to a reduced desire for the chocolate due to change in taste, not a change in appetite (105347,112183 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Possibly Safe</data><data key="overview_text">The gymnema plant is a climbing plant, with small yellow flowers.

It is unclear if oral gymnema is beneficial for diabetes. A meta-analysis of 10 small clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking gymnema modestly reduces fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels, and also seems to reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), when compared to baseline. Gymnema may also modestly reduce total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. ( 110022 ). Another meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies, that includes some of the same studies, also shows that taking gymnema modestly reduces fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when compared with diet or placebo. However, this analysis shows that gymnema does not improve HbA1c, oral glucose tolerance, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( 112184 ). The validity of these analyses is limited by the inclusion of mostly low-quality studies that enrolled heterogeneous patient populations and employed varying gymnema dosing regimens of 0.4-10 grams daily, sometimes in conjunction with antidiabetes medications. In addition, many of the included studies were non-randomized and lacked a comparator group. more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral gymnema is beneficial for impaired glucose tolerance. One small clinical study in overweight or obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking gymnema (Swanson Superior Herbs) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve glucose control, lipid profile, anthropometric indices, or blood pressure when compared with placebo ( 105346 ). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral gymnema is beneficial for metabolic syndrome.

However, it is unclear if these changes are significant when compared with placebo. In addition, gymnema does not appear to improve blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, or blood lipid levels when compared with placebo ( 96235 ). more Obesity. It is unclear if oral gymnema improves weight loss in overweight or obese adults. One small clinical study shows that taking gymnema leaf (Swanson Premium G. sylvestre leaf, Swanson Health Products) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces body weight and body mass index (BMI) when compared to baseline in overweight adults with metabolic syndrome. However, it is unclear if these changes are significant when compared with placebo ( 96235 ). Another small clinical study by the same authors evaluating overweight adults with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking gymnema (Swanson Superior Herbs) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight or BMI when compared with placebo ( 105346 ). Gymnema has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. One small clinical study shows that taking a combination of gymnema extract 400 mg, hydroxycitric acid 2800 mg, and niacin-bound chromium 4 mg orally daily for 8 weeks decreases BMI and body weight when compared to baseline in overweight and obese adults. This product provided 400 mcg of elemental chromium and 100 mg of gymnemic acids ( 42604 ).

Myo-inositol is the most abundant form in the central nervous system (CNS). Biological function varies among the isomers ( 2047 , 2048 ). Myo-inositol is a source of second messengers such as diacylglycerol. It is required for growth of human cells ( 95090 ). Anti-carcinogenic effects Dysplasia in the central airways and peripheral lung is a risk marker for lung cancer, and there is an interest in using myo-inositol for preventing lung cancer. However, early clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol (Tsuno Food Industries Co., Ltd.) 9 grams orally once daily for 2 weeks then twice daily for 6 months, does not significantly affect bronchial dysplasia in smokers with bronchial dysplasia considered high risk for lung cancer, compared to placebo. There was also no difference in Ki-67 (a marker of proliferation) in the bronchial biopsies with dysplasia between groups post-treatment. However, myo-inositol lead to a significant decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL), with a trend towards decreasing oxidant level. Increased baseline plasma and BAL levels of Clara cell protein-16 (an antiinflammatory protein secreted by bronchiolar cells) were associated with positive outcomes as well as decreased levels of plasma myeloperoxidase ( 95090 ). In smokers with epithelial bronchial dysplasia, the PI3K pathway is activated. The PI3K/Akt pathway regulates cell proliferation and survival. PI3K gene expression in normal epithelium decreased in patients who experienced a complete response to myo-inositol, suggesting that myo-inositiol inhibits PI3K signaling. This was not seen in non-responders nor in the placebo group ( 95090 ). Central nervous system (CNS) effects There is interest in using inositol for various psychiatric disorders. Decreased brain levels of inositol have been seen in patients suffering from depression, anxiety and compulsive disorders ( 95089 , 95092 ). Inositol is a constituent of the intracellular phosphatidyl inositol second messenger system, which is linked to several neurotransmitters including alpha 1 noradrenergic, serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate and cholinergic receptors ( 10850 , 11972 , 95089 , 95092 ). Inositol may play a role in the interactions between G protein-coupled receptors and their ligands particularly in the serotonergic pathway ( 95089 , 95092 ). Inositol might reverse desensitization of serotonin receptors ( 2187 ). Limited clinical evidence suggests exogenous inositol may have benefits similar to selective-serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in conditions such as panic disorder, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Dermatologic effects Supplemental inositol seems to help psoriasis that is made worse or triggered by lithium therapy. The mechanism is unknown, but lithium seems to cause a reduction of inositol in both the brain and other tissues. Supplementation with inositol doesn't seem to adversely affect the efficacy of lithium for bipolar disorder ( 11972 ). Fertility effects There is interest in using inositol for infertility. In patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol, D-chiro-inositol, or a combination of these two forms, seems to improve ovulation and pregnancy rates ( 91544 , 91550 , 91553 , 102317 ). In patients with oligoasthenospermia, clinical research shows that treating sperm with myo-inositol in vitro increases sperm motility. This increased motility results in an 18% increased rate of pregnancy during intrauterine insemination when compared with control ( 102318 ). Growth effects There is interest in using inositol for growth. Preliminary clinical research in children with idiopathic short stature shows that taking an inositol and vitamin B solution, 10 mL twice daily, for 12 months modestly increases height when compared to baseline. Improvements were larger in those that also completed stretching exercises ( 112280 ). Insulin sensitizing effects In laboratory and animal studies, it has been shown that insulin resistance is directly related to a deficiency in D-chiro-inositol and an imbalance with myo-inositol. ( 95086 , 95088 ). D-chiro-inositol acts as a second messenger of insulin signaling and is an insulin sensitizer. Laboratory research suggests that it possesses insulin-mimetic activity and, in peripheral tissues, leads to disposal of intracellular glucose and glycogen storage ( 95088 ). Inositol is also a precursor for phosphoinositides. Phosphoinositides play a role in cell signaling and are also secondary messengers involved in glucose metabolism and insulin like effects. Inositol is also a precursor for inositol phosphoglycans (IPG). There are two groups, the P-type and A-type, which are antagonists of each other. The P-type are involved in the activation of glycolysis, while the A type suppresses steps of glycolysis. Insulin resistance leads to increases in urinary inositol metabolites, mostly the A-type. This alters the ratio of A to P-type, leading to a suppression of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Providing inositol supplements in theory, shifts the ratio of A and P-type back to normal ( 95082 , 95083 ). Furthermore, inositol may increase levels of adipocytokines, particularly adiponectin, which are negatively correlated with glucose and insulin concentrations. When insulin binds to receptors, it may stimulate the intracellular transport of inositol phosphoglycan. Myo-inositol may activate lipogenesis via stimulation of acetyl-CoA-carboxylase ( 95083 ). It's thought that a defect in the availability or metabolism of inositol or IPGs may play a role in insulin resistance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ( 95085 ). As such, there is interest in using inositol in patients with PCOS. Researchers think that inositol induces ovulation in these patients by improving insulin sensitivity. It also produces the second messenger inositol triphosphate which is involved in regulation of certain hormones such as thyroid stimulating hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone as well ( 95084 , 95085 ). Reduced insulin resistance is also thought to be responsible for improving other symptoms associated with PCOS, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, obesity, and increased serum testosterone concentrations ( 2028 ). Additionally, patients with insulin resistance, including those with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes, might have D-chiro-inositol deficiency ( 2028 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Possibly Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Inositol</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Metabolic syndrome. Oral inositol seems to modestly improve lipid parameters, blood pressure, and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic syndrome. Some clinical research in postmenopausal adults with metabolic syndrome following a low-calorie diet shows that taking myo-inositol 2 grams twice daily for one year reduces total cholesterol by 29 mg/dL, triglycerides by 64 mg/dL, systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 9 mmHg and 6 mmHg, respectively, increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 6 mg/dL, and improves insulin resistance when compared with placebo. It did not reduce body mass index or waist circumference in these patients ( 91554 ). A meta-analysis of clinical studies in a mixed population shows similar effects on blood pressure, especially among postmenopausal adults with metabolic syndrome, at durations exceeding 8 weeks, and at doses of at least 4 grams ( 108820 ). Inositol has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients to treat metabolic syndrome. A clinical study in postmenopausal adults with metabolic syndrome and at risk for breast cancer shows that taking a combination of inositol and alpha-lipoic acid daily for 6 months, in combination with a low-calorie diet, reduces insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) by at least 20% when compared with a low-calorie diet alone. Also, taking inositol and alpha-lipoic acid seems to increase HDL cholesterol by about 6% and reduce triglycerides by 5% when compared to baseline ( 91543 ). Another small clinical study in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a specific combination product containing D-chiro-inositol 40 mg, Ceylon cinnamon 250 mg, glucomannan 1000 mg, and inulin 200 mg orally daily for 4 months modestly improves total cholesterol levels and body weight, but not serum glycated hemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein levels, high-density lipoprotein levels, or triglyceride levels when compared with no intervention ( 114552 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral inositol, often in combination with folic acid, seems to improve some glycemic, lipid, metabolic, hormonal, and reproductive parameters in patients with PCOS. However, research is conflicting. Oral inositol, most frequently in the forms of myo-inositol or D-chiro-inositol, has been evaluated for efficacy in a wide range of outcomes associated with PCOS including reproductive and pregnancy outcomes, metabolic parameters, and anthropomorphic measures. Often, inositol is taken in combination with folic acid or metformin. Inositol has been investigated for its effect on metabolic parameters that are often altered in PCOS. A meta-analysis of 9 studies in patients with PCOS shows that taking myo-inositol or D-chiro-inositol with or without folic acid marginally decreases body mass index (BMI) by about 0.5 kg/m2 when compared with placebo ( 111670 ). Inositol has also been evaluated for its effect on glucose metabolism in adults with PCOS. Meta-analyses of about 10 studies show that taking myo-inositol or D-chiro-inositol with or without folic acid reduces fasting plasma glucose by 1-4 mg/dL ( 98944 , 111670 ). However, evidence is conflicting on the effect of inositol on insulin levels and measures of insulin resistance ( 98944 , 111670 ). Additionally, most studies show that inositol does not improve measures of glucose metabolism more than metformin. The effect of inositol on lipid profiles has also been studied. A meta-analysis of 2 clinical studies and other small clinical studies show that taking inositol as D-chiro-inositol with or without folic acid modestly reduces total cholesterol and triglycerides when compared with control ( 2028 , 98944 , 91552 ). Some studies have also investigated the effect of inositol on hormone levels. Meta-analyses show that inositol modulates androgen levels as shown by reduced total and free testosterone, androstenedione, and increased sex-hormone binding globulin when compared with placebo. ( 2028 , 91552 , 98944 , 111670 ). The validity of these effects is limited by high heterogeneity in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, dose, and treatment duration within the included studies. Myo-inositol has also been compared with metformin in some clinical research, with some evidence of benefit ( 95085 , 95086 ). Meta-analyses of small clinical studies show that taking myo-inositol 2-4 grams daily, with or without folic acid, for 12-24 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), BMI, waist-hip circumference, or androgen levels when compared with metformin 1.5-2.5 grams daily ( 100705 , 108823 , 111670 , 111670 ). However, inositol seems to have a lower risk of adverse effects than metformin. These analyses are limited due to the small size, methodological issues, and high heterogeneity of the included studies. In combination with metformin, small clinical studies show that taking metformin, myo-inositol 550 mg, and D-chiro-inositol 150 mg twice daily is associated with improved lipid parameters and postprandial insulin levels when compared with metformin alone ( 108822 ). Meta-analyses and clinical studies have investigated the effect of inositol on ovulation, reproduction, and pregnancy outcomes. Some research suggests that inositol increases ovulation rate, promotes cycle normalization, and improves ovarian function in patients with PCOS ( 2028 , 91552 , 98944 , 111670 ). A small clinical study shows that taking myo-inositol 4 grams and folic acid 400 mcg (Inofolic, Lo.Li.Pharma) daily for three spontaneous cycles induces ovulation in about 62% of individuals with anovulatory PCOS and insulin resistance. Adding clomiphene citrate with myo-inositol induces ovulation in about 72% of the patients who remain anovulatory after treatment with myo-inositol alone ( 91547 ). Another clinical study shows that taking a combination of inositol 2 grams, folic acid 200 mcg, and N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg (Ovaric HP, Just Pharma) twice daily for 12 months improves ovulation rates in PCOS patients with oligomenorrhea, regardless of insulin sensitivity at baseline ( 91553 ). Despite evidence that inositol improves ovulation rates, it does not appear to impact pregnancy rates ( 111670 ). Some research has also investigated the effects of taking both isomers of inositol concomitantly. Taking myo-inositol 550 mg plus D-chiro-inositol 13.8 mg (Inofolic Combi, Lo.Li.Pharma) twice daily, beginning 12 weeks before ovarian hyperstimulation and continuing throughout pregnancy, improves oocyte quality when compared to treatment with D-chiro-inositol alone. The combination appears to increase fertilization rate in patients aged 35 years or younger, but not those older than 35 years ( 91544 ). Other clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol 550 mg and D-chiro-inositol 150 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves pregnancy rates and live birth rates by an additional 10% and 11%, respectively, when compared with myo-inositol 550 mg plus D-chiro-inositol 13.8 mg. The higher-dose combination also resulted in a 15% lower rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome when compared with those taking the lower dose of D-chiro-inositol ( 102317 ). Lastly, other research shows that taking myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol together may improve metabolic parameters faster than taking myo-inositol alone ( 91550 ). Research has also evaluated the effects of inositol on other pertinent clinical outcomes in PCOS. Several small clinical studies show that taking the combination of myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol, alone or in combination with metformin, improves menstrual cycle irregularity when compared with metformin alone, but not as much as a taking a combined hormonal contraceptive ( 108822 , 108824 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded nature of the studies. Also, a small clinical study shows that taking metformin with myo-inositol 550 mg and D-chiro-inositol 150 mg twice daily is associated with improved acne, but not hirsutism, at 6 months, when compared with metformin alone ( 108822 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded nature of the study. More research is needed to clarify the effect of inositol on anthropometric, metabolic, and endocrine outcomes in patients with PCOS. more Preterm labor. Oral inositol in combination with folic acid seems to prevent preterm labor in individuals at risk for gestational diabetes. A meta-analysis of five clinical trials in individuals at risk for gestational diabetes shows that taking myo-inositol plus folic acid daily, beginning during the first trimester and continuing throughout pregnancy, decreases the risk of preterm delivery by 64% when compared with folic acid alone. Patients in all but one study included in this analysis took myo-inositol 2 grams plus folic acid 200 mcg twice daily, while patients in the other study took myo-inositol 1100 mg plus D-chiro-inositol 27.6 mg and folic acid 400 mcg daily ( 100706 ). It's unclear if these results are generalizable to individuals with a low risk for gestational diabetes. more Possibly Ineffective Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Oral or intravenous inositol does not seem to prevent ARDS in preterm infants and may be associated with worsened outcomes. Historically, small clinical trials in infants with or at risk for ARDS have suggested that myo-inositol, given parenterally and enterally for 5-10 days, might improve survival and reduce the risk of death and serious complications ( 2191 , 2192 , 91546 ). However, a large, high-quality clinical study in infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation at risk for ARDS shows that myo-inositol 40 mg/kg given intravenously and then enterally every 12 hours for up to 70 days does not reduce the risk of death or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). In fact, the rate of death or type 1 ROP increased by 7% in the myo-inositol group when compared to the control group, and a higher incidence of adverse events in the myo-inositol group, including poor perfusion, hypotension, and infections, led to early trial discontinuation ( 98946 ). Long-term follow-up until 24 months corrected age confirms that the initial increase in mortality rate in the myo-inositol group remained stable; however, there was no difference in a composite outcome of death or survival with moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment, as well as no difference in the risk of ROP, between the treatment and control groups ( 108819 ). The most recent meta-analysis, which incorporates this large clinical study, concludes that inositol supplementation does not reduce the risk of death in infants at risk for ARDS ( 102319 ). more Anxiety. Oral inositol does not seem to be beneficial for patients with anxiety. A meta-analysis of four clinical trials shows that taking inositol orally does not improve anxiety severity in patients with anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, when compared with placebo ( 91549 ). more Depression. Oral inositol does not seem to be beneficial for patients with depression. Guidelines from the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that inositol in doses up to 12 grams daily is not currently recommended as monotherapy or adjunctive use for major depressive disorder due to a lack of evidence for efficacy ( 110318 ). Additionally, a meta-analysis of seven clinical trials shows that inositol does not significantly improve symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar depression, major depressive disorder, or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) ( 91549 ). While limited research shows that patients receiving inositol for 4 weeks may improve, patients initially responding to inositol seem to relapse rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment ( 2026 , 2185 ). Additionally, taking inositol with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) doesn't appear to improve the effectiveness of SSRI therapy or improve depression in SSRI treatment failures ( 2025 , 10851 ). more Diabetic neuropathy. Oral inositol does not seem to be beneficial for patients with diabetic neuropathy. Most preliminary clinical research shows that taking inositol orally doesn't improve the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy ( 2193 , 2194 , 2195 ). more Retinopathy of prematurity. Oral or intravenous inositol does not seem to prevent retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants. A meta-analysis of six clinical trials shows that myo-inositol, given parenterally and/or enterally, does not seem to reduce the risk of ROP when compared with placebo in preterm infants ( 100704 ). A large, high-quality clinical study included in this meta-analysis shows that myo-inositol 40 mg/kg given intravenously and then enterally every 12 hours for up to 70 days does not reduce the risk of death or ROP in infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation. In fact, the rate of death or type 1 ROP increased by 7% in the myo-inositol group when compared with placebo and a higher incidence of adverse events in the myo-inositol group, including poor perfusion, hypotension, and infections, led to early trial discontinuation ( 98946 ). Long-term follow-up until 24 months corrected age confirms that the initial increase in mortality rate in the myo-inositol group remained stable; however, there was no difference in a composite outcome of death or survival with moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment, as well as no difference in the risk of ROP, between the treatment and control groups ( 108819 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Age-related testosterone deficiency. It is unclear if oral D-chiro-inositol is beneficial in patients with age-related testosterone deficiency. A very small clinical study in males aged 65-75 years with low-normal morning testosterone levels and signs and symptoms of androgen deficiency shows that taking D-chiro-inositol 600 mg twice daily for 30 days improves sexual function and physical strength when compared with baseline ( 108821 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Bipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in patients with bipolar disorder. Evidence is conflicting on whether inositol helps treat bipolar disorder in children. One very small preliminary study in children aged 5-12 years with bipolar disorder not on concomitant mood-stabilizing medications shows that taking inositol 80 mg/kg (maximum 2 grams) daily for 12 weeks reduces manic symptoms when compared to baseline. Additionally, taking a combination of inositol 80 mg/kg and high eicosapentaenoic acid omega-3 fatty acid capsules (EPA; Nordic Naturals) 1650-3000 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces manic and depressive symptoms when compared to baseline ( 95092 ). However, another more recent study with the same intervention and protocol shows that the combination of inositol and high eicosapentaenoic acid omega-3 fatty acid reduces symptoms of depression, but does not improve manic symptoms, when compared with either ingredient taken alone ( 111676 ). more Chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. Oral inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in adults undergoing breast cancer surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy shows that taking inositol orally 390 mg twice daily and applying IP-6 gel 4% twice daily to the surgical site, starting 2 weeks before adjuvant chemotherapy and stopping 2 weeks after the last cycle, attenuates reductions in white and red blood cell counts when compared with no intervention. Using inositol and IP-6 also improves breast and arm symptom scores and some quality of life scores; however, these improvements were not consistent over time. more Child growth. Oral inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A sub-analysis of a large randomized controlled trial shows that twice daily maternal use of a drink supplement containing myo-inositol 4 grams, folic acid, vitamins D, B6, and B12, zinc, lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and other nutrients throughout pregnancy increases the likelihood of the infant being in the normal weight range after 2 years of follow up when compared with placebo. Infants of mothers using the drink supplement had a reduced likelihood of rapid weight gain when compared with placebo; other anthropomorphic measurements were similar between groups ( 115691 ). It is unclear if any effects are due to inositol, other ingredients, or the combination. more Diabetes. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for the treatment of type 1 diabetes or the prevention of gestational diabetes. Preliminary clinical research in patients with type 1 diabetes and a body mass index of at least 25 kg/m2 shows that taking a specific combination product containing D-chiro-inositol and folic acid (Chirofol 500, LJ Pharma) daily for 6 months, along with insulin therapy, decreases glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by approximately 0.5% when compared to taking folic acid alone with insulin therapy. However, there was no difference between groups with respect to insulin resistance or body mass index ( 95088 ). Most research shows that taking inositol during pregnancy prevents gestational diabetes. However, most studies conducted to date are of low quality and it is unclear if the results are generalizable. Meta-analyses of 4-7 clinical studies in pregnant adults, some with overweight and obesity, shows that taking myo-inositol 2-4 g daily with folic acid (usually as Inofolic, Lo.Li. Pharma International) may reduce the relative risk of gestational diabetes by 57% to 92% and reduce insulin requirements in adults at risk for gestational diabetes. Inositol may also be associated with improved infant outcomes such as increased gestational age at birth and reduced preterm delivery, but does not seem to influence birth weight, NICU admission rate, neonatal hypoglycemia, the incidence of shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, or cesarian delivery when compared with control ( 100706 , 103750 , 104688 , 111664 , 111667 , 111671 , 111677 , 114560 ). The validity of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity within the included studies, concerns about blinding, and overall low-quality evidence. Research evaluating a lower daily dose of myo-inositol 1.1 grams with D-chiro-inositol 27.6 mg and folic acid 400 mcg (Inofolic Combi, Lo.Li. Pharma International) during pregnancy shows no effect on incidence of gestational diabetes when compared with folic acid alone in adults with a family history of diabetes ( 95082 , 103750 ). Some evidence suggests that initiation of myo-inositol, in combination with vitamins and other ingredients, earlier during pregnancy (e.g., 7 weeks' gestation) may be associated with increased blood glucose levels at 28 weeks' gestation. Some researchers have postulated that the beneficial effects of myo-inositol may be optimized by initiating therapy later in pregnancy. However, this hypothesis has not been well researched ( 115694 ). In patients eventually diagnosed with gestational diabetes, one small clinical study shows that taking myo-inositol 2 grams reduces the number of patients requiring insulin by at least 50% ( 104688 ), although another small clinical study shows that adding D-chiro-inositol, myo-inositol, or both to folic acid does not affect insulin resistance when compared with placebo ( 98945 ). more Dyslipidemia. Although there has been interest in using oral inositol for hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of inositol for these conditions. Erectile dysfunction (ED). Oral inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Another very small study in males with overweight or obesity, mild ED, and normal to low androgen levels shows that taking a combination product containing myo-inositol 4000 mg, alpha-lipoic acid, folic acid, and apple (Sinopol Forte) improves measures of erectile dysfunction when compared with baseline ( 111674 ). The validity of these effects is limited by the small sample size and the lack of a comparator group, and it is unclear if these effects are due to inositol, other ingredients, or the combination. more Hypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral inositol for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of inositol for this condition. Hypothyroidism. Inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A meta-analysis of clinical and observational research in adults with hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and other thyroid disorders shows that taking a combination of inositol 600-1200 mg and selenium 83-166 mg orally daily for 6-12 months modestly improves thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and thyroxine levels when compared with control ( 114562 ). Clinical research in females aged 18 to 50 years with or at risk for subclinical hypothyroidism in Slovakia shows that taking myo-inositol 600 mg and selenium 83 mcg daily for 6 months reduces patient-reported hypothyroid symptoms including fatigue, menstrual cycle irregularity, and intolerance to heat or cold ( 110591 ). The interpretation of this result is limited by the lack of a control group. In addition, it is unclear if the effects in these studies are due to myo-inositol, selenium, or the combination. more Infertility. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in adults undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF). Many small studies report conflicting effects of oral myo-inositol on fertilization rates, implantation rates, and live birth rates in adults undergoing IVF or ICSI ( 103752 , 108825 , 111672 ). Many of these trials used a specific combination product containing myo-inositol 4 grams and folic acid 400 mcg (Inofolic, Lo.Li. Pharma International S.r.l) daily, starting 1-3 months before ICSI and continuing until ovulation ( 103752 , 108825 ). Meta-analyses of up to 8 small randomized controlled trials in adults undergoing assisted reproduction (e.g., ICSI, IVF) with or without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) shows that taking myo-inositol 2-4 grams orally daily, with or without folic acid, for 8-12 weeks modestly improves the number of oocytes obtained, but does not affect the miscarriage rate or clinical pregnancy rate, when compared with placebo ( 115693 ). The validity of this study is limited by moderate heterogeneity. The effects of inositol on fertility have also been studied in patients with specific comorbidities. A case-control study in long-term survivors of lymphoma suggests that taking myo-inositol 400 mg and D-chiro-inositol 45 mg (Ovofert Fast, CRL Pharma) three times daily for 12 months is associated with reductions in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea and a modest increase in antral follicle count of the right ovary when compared with control ( 111673 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding. Inositol has also been evaluated in females with PCOS. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults with PCOS undergoing IVF or ICSI shows that inositol does not improve pregnancy rates when compared to no treatment. However, inositol may increase clinical pregnancy rates when compared with metformin ( 111675 ). Inositol has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A large clinical study in females planning to conceive shows that taking a combination product containing myo-inositol 4 grams, vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, zinc, and probiotics does not improve time-to-conception, clinical pregnancy rates, or live birth rates when compared with a standard micronutrient supplement. However, the supplement shortens time-to-conception in adults with overweight to durations equivalent to patients who are not overweight, but lengthens time to conception in adults with obesity when compared with placebo ( 111665 ). It is unclear whether these effects are due to inositol, other ingredients, or the combination. more Insomnia. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for improving sleep during pregnancy. Clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol 2 grams plus folic acid 200 mcg (Inofolic, Lo.Li. Pharma International) before bed for 10 weeks, starting at 14 weeks gestation, improves overall measures of sleep quality by a small amount when compared with folic acid alone. However, this improvement was not maintained until 37-38 weeks' gestation. Also, the study was not limited to patients with poor sleep quality during pregnancy, but to any healthy pregnant individual ( 104687 ). more Lithium-induced side effects. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for reducing lithium-induced side effects. A small clinical study suggests that taking inositol 6 grams daily for 10 weeks may improve psoriasis associated with lithium therapy when compared with baseline ( 11972 ). However, taking inositol orally does not seem to improve other lithium-induced adverse effects, such as tremor, thirst, and changes in thyroid and adrenal function ( 2027 ). more Lung cancer. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for slowing the rate of bronchial dysplasia. Preliminary clinical research in smokers with bronchial dysplasia considered at high risk for lung cancer shows that taking myo-inositol (Tsuno Food Industries Co., Ltd.) 9 grams orally once daily for 2 weeks then twice daily for 6 months, does not increase the rate of complete or partial response when compared with placebo ( 95090 ). more Mastalgia. Inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for cyclic mastalgia; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small retrospective study in females with cyclic mastalgia suggests that applying a specific product containing inositol, Boswellia serrata, and betaine (Eumastos Gel, Lo.Li. Pharma s.r.l.) 2.5 grams topically once daily from the 10 th to the 25 th day of the menstrual cycle for three months is associated with reductions in mastalgia pain scores when compared with a control cohort ( 115695 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the retrospective nature of the study and the lack of a placebo control. more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for NAFLD. A small clinical study in adults with NAFLD and obesity shows that taking myo-inositol powder 4 grams daily for 8 weeks does not improve liver health markers, such as liver function test levels or liver steatosis, but does improve some components of lipid profiles, glycemic indices, and anthropometric measures when compared to baseline ( 111304 ) However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect differences in some of the outcomes. more Obesity. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in patients with overweight or obesity. A meta-analysis of 15 clinical studies in adults shows that taking inositol 600-4450 mg daily for 6-48 weeks decreases body mass index (BMI) by about 0.4 kg/m2. Subgroup analysis suggests that myo-inositol may be beneficial at a dosage less than 1000 mg for less than 12 weeks, especially in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and overweight or obesity, with higher baseline BMI, and above 40 years of age ( 111666 ). However, the validity of this finding is limited by significant heterogeneity in the included studies. more Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in patients with OCD. One preliminary clinical study in adults with OCD shows that taking inositol 18 grams daily for 6 weeks improves Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores when compared with placebo ( 2186 ). However, taking inositol does not seem to improve the severity or type of OCD symptoms in patients already taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( 91556 ). Both of these studies were small, and treatment was administered for only 6 weeks. more Panic disorder. Oral inositol seems to improve symptoms of panic disorder. A very small clinical study shows that taking inositol 12 grams daily reduces the severity and rate of panic attacks and the severity of agoraphobia over 4 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo ( 2184 ). Another very small clinical study shows that taking inositol 18 grams daily for one month may be as effective as fluvoxamine 150 mg daily for treatment of panic disorder ( 10387 ). However, the one-month duration may not have provided adequate time to see the full effects of fluvoxamine. more Postpartum complications. Inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A post-hoc analysis of a clinical study suggests that higher blood levels of myo-inositol early in pregnancy are associated with less postpartum blood loss when compared with lower blood levels of myo-insositol ( 115692 ). The effects of inositol supplementation are unclear. more Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in patients with PTSD. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking inositol 12 grams daily for 4 weeks does not improve distress when compared with placebo in patients with PTSD ( 91557 ). more Pregnancy-induced hypertension. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for preventing hypertension during pregnancy. In patients with a body mass index (BMI) between 25-29.9 kg/m2, preliminary clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol 2 grams plus folic acid 200 mcg (Inofolic, Lo.Li. Pharma International) twice daily, beginning during the first trimester and continuing throughout pregnancy, decreases the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension by 66% when compared with folic acid alone ( 104688 ). more Psoriasis. It is unclear if oral or topical inositol is beneficial for improving symptoms of psoriasis. One small clinical study shows that taking inositol 6 grams daily for 10 weeks does not improve symptoms of psoriasis in a small group of patients when compared to baseline. However, taking this dose of inositol has a moderate effect on overall symptoms in patients with psoriasis related to lithium use ( 11972 ). Preliminary clinical research also shows that topical use of D-chiro-inositol is unlikely to be beneficial for reducing overall symptoms of psoriasis. Topical application of inositol 0.25% or 1% for 6 weeks improves overall symptoms when compared with baseline. However, the inositol-containing creams were no more effective than the control cream ( 104686 ). Inositol has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small prospective observational study in adults with mild plaque psoriasis suggests that applying amino-inositol and urea 40% cream (Inosit U40, Biogena) 1-2 times daily for 4 weeks is associated with reductions in the severity and extent of psoriasis symptoms and improvements in quality of life measures when compared to baseline ( 111668 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a small sample size, a lack of a comparator group, insufficient blinding, and the observational study design. more Trichotillomania. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for reducing hair pulling. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking inositol in doses ranging from 6-18 grams daily over a period of 10 weeks is no more effective than placebo in reducing subjective or clinician-documented symptoms of hair pulling in patients with trichotillomania ( 95089 ). more More evidence is needed to rate inositol for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Inositol has been used with apparent safety in doses up to 18 grams daily for up to 6 weeks or 6 grams daily for 10 weeks ( 2184 , 2185 , 2187 , 95089 ). Myo-inositol 4 grams daily has also been used with apparent safety for 6 months ( 95085 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of inositol when used topically. CHILDREN: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately. Inositol 80 mg/kg (maximum 2 grams) has been taken daily for up to 12 weeks in children aged 5-12 years ( 95092 ). ...when used enterally or intravenously and appropriately in premature infants for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome for up to 10 days ( 2191 , 2192 , 91546 , 91551 ). CHILDREN: Possibly Unsafe when used enterally or intravenously for extended durations in premature infants. A large clinical study in infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation found that myo-inositol 40 mg/kg, given intravenously and then enterally every 12 hours for up to 10 weeks, was associated with a small increased risk of death ( 98946 ). Long-term follow-up until 24 months corrected age confirms that the initial increase in mortality rate in the myo-inositol group remained stable; however, there was no difference in a composite outcome of death or survival with moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment, as well as no difference in the risk of retinopathy of prematurity, between those who received myo-inositol or control ( 108819 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Myo-inositol has been used with apparent safety in amounts up to 4000 mg daily during pregnancy ( 91548 , 95082 , 104688 ). LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using. Breast milk is rich in endogenous inositol ( 2138 ); however, the effects of exogenously administered inositol are not known.</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: Inositol is typically used in doses of 1-4 grams daily, often in combination with folic acid 200-400 mcg daily.

It is found naturally in foods such as red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products ( 3330 ). L-arginine is best known for its effects on the vascular system. L-arginine is a substrate for the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme. In human research, taking L-arginine has been shown to increase blood levels of nitric oxide (NO) ( 110391 ). In vascular endothelial cells, NOS converts L-arginine to NO, also known as endothelium-derived relaxation factor (EDRF), which causes vasodilation. L-arginine can improve coronary endothelial function and brachial artery endothelium-dependent dilation and reduce monocyte/endothelial cell adhesion in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or hypercholesterolemia, resulting in increased coronary blood flow ( 110 , 116 , 1362 , 1363 , 3330 , 13710 , 14913 , 32017 ). Anti-inflammatory effects In human research, L-arginine does not seem to have anti-inflammatory effects based on blood levels of inflammatory mediators including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) ( 102589 , 102590 , 112128 ). Similarly, L-arginine does not seem to alter levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 ( 112128 ). In some individuals, including those over 60 years and those with cancer, CRP levels might be increased ( 102589 ). Antibacterial effects L-arginine has been studied for antibacterial effects ( 32013 , 31909 , 32041 , 32024 , 32196 ). Nitric oxide might be involved in host inflammatory and microbial killing responses ( 3460 ). When used in the mouth, L-arginine is thought to be converted to ammonia by oral non-pathogenic bacteria, increasing the local pH and reducing the cariogenicity of other bacteria ( 96806 ). Anticancer effects There is interest in L-arginine for adjunctive use in treating breast cancer. The enzyme amino-peptidase N/CD13 (APN) has been associated with the growth of cancers such as breast cancer. Laboratory research shows that certain L-arginine derivatives inhibit the APN N/CD13 enzyme ( 32092 ). In addition, there is some evidence that L-arginine modifies immune system function and might potentiate tumor cell response to anti-cancer drugs and possibly reduce the immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy agents. L-arginine seems to increase lymphocyte reactivity to polyclonal mitogenic agents and might also enhance natural cytotoxicity ( 3331 ). However, L-arginine also promotes the growth of tumors by providing a source of nitrogen. In some situations the nutritional value of L-arginine may outweigh its antitumor effects ( 7814 ). Anticonvulsive effects Nitric oxide can help prevent seizures. L-arginine can increase nitric oxide levels. Animal research shows that giving L-arginine to rats with drug-induced seizures increases the time to first seizure and decreases seizure-induced mortality. This therapeutic effect may be due to increased nitric oxide levels ( 32121 ). Antidiabetic effects People with diabetes appear to have lower than normal levels of L-arginine, and increased levels of the enzyme asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADME), which might contribute to peripheral vascular disease in people with diabetes ( 14913 ). L-arginine is metabolized to L-ornithine, then to L-proline, which is used in collagen synthesis and wound healing ( 14914 ). However, if metabolized through a different pathway, L-arginine may have a negative effect on diabetic ulcers. Increased levels of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) can increase the metabolism of L-arginine to nitric oxide (NO) and may impair diabetic ulcer healing due to NO's free radical effects on tissues ( 14915 ). L-arginine may help increase glucose disposal ( 31875 ), increase insulin sensitivity ( 32269 ), and increase plasma insulin levels in response to meals ( 32136 ) in diabetic and pre-diabetic patients. It has been proposed that L-arginine increases adiponectin secretion in the adipose tissue and may increase insulin sensitivity by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, which can improve glucose uptake and utilization by the muscles ( 104225 ). Antioxidant effects Research is conflicting on whether L-arginine protects against oxidative stress. Some evidence shows that L-arginine has antioxidant effects and can reduce lipid peroxidation. This might prevent damage by oxidant radicals and attenuate damage from numerous conditions including myocardial ischemia, atherosclerosis, and stress ( 31926 , 31931 , 31964 , 32161 , 32179 , 32259 , 110385 ). However, a meta-analysis of 2 clinical studies shows that L-arginine does not improve antioxidant status as measured by superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. Additionally, 4 clinical studies in the meta-analysis found that L-arginine does not modulate markers of oxidative stress including thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, carbonyls, uric acid, malondialdehyde (MDA), neutrophil MDA, creatine, and lactate dehydrogenase ( 112128 ). Cardiovascular effects L-arginine has been assessed for a number of cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. L-arginine has been studied for its antihypertensive effects. The production of NO from L-arginine and NO-induced vasodilation may be responsible for mildly reducing blood pressure ( 10636 , 32266 ). However, a meta-analysis of patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity, shows that taking L-arginine does not improve flow-mediated dilation or NO ( 99262 ). L-arginine reduces the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme, decreasing the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and also increases aldosterone, which signals for increased water and sodium retention. Therefore, the blood pressure lowering effects of L-arginine can be attributed to reducing angiotensin I conversion ( 7820 ). Some evidence is available indicating the effect on coronary blood flow is larger in African-Americans than in Caucasians ( 8472 ). L-arginine seems to prevent nitrate tolerance by improving nitric acid bioavailability and may act as an antioxidant, decreasing production of vascular superoxide ( 8475 ). The production of NO from L-arginine substrate is impaired in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) ( 8016 ). Intravenous L-arginine can have many beneficial hemodynamic effects in heart failure, including decreased heart rate (8 beats/minute), decreased mean arterial pressure (14 mmHg), increased cardiac output (0.7 l/minute), and increased stroke volume (14 mL) ( 8444 ). The beneficial effect of L-arginine on NO may help patients with vaso-occlusive crisis or pulmonary hypertension secondary to sickle cell disease. Adults and children experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis have lower plasma concentrations of arginine when compared to sickle cell patients not experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis ( 97392 ). L-arginine donates nitrogen for NO synthesis. L-arginine also decreases levels of circulating plasma endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor ( 11428 ). In most people with a normal diet, the concentration of L-arginine inside the cells of the body is adequate to ensure that the NOS enzyme is producing NO at maximal capacity. As a result, L-arginine supplementation is likely to be more effective in patients who have a deficiency of L-arginine ( 7820 ). L-arginine has actions on the cardiovascular system and other systems that are independent of the conversion to NO. Among other actions, L-arginine can directly reduce blood viscosity, reduce the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme, and reduce lipid peroxidation ( 7820 ). The decrease in blood viscosity can be attributed to L-arginine induced decreases in platelet aggregation ( 31864 , 32188 , 32220 , 32239 , 32257 , 32260 , 32263 , 32276 ). However, L-arginine does not seem to have anti-inflammatory effects based on blood levels of inflammatory mediators including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) ( 102589 , 102590 ). In some individuals, including those over 60 years and those with cancer, CRP levels might be increased ( 102589 ). Exercise effects L-arginine has been used to improve exercise performance. It is possible that L-arginine works by improving oxygen utilization in active young adult males ( 32104 ). However, L-arginine supplementation does not seem to have this effect in trained athletes ( 32170 , 32158 ). L-arginine supplementation in healthy adults and trained athletes may reduce levels of creatine kinase, lactate, and/or ammonia during or following exercise. It is unclear if these changes are significant enough to play a role in improved exercise performance ( 31894 , 110381 , 110389 , 116207 ). Finally, in rats, L-arginine oral supplementation appears to attenuate oxidative stress that is induced by exercise ( 32005 ). Genitourinary effects Besides its effect on the systemic cardiovascular system, NO also increases the relaxation of urinary tract smooth muscle ( 3259 , 3460 , 31878 ) and is involved in erectile function. Although L-arginine appears to be helpful for erectile dysfunction, L-arginine may not affect the hemodynamics of the corpus cavernosum ( 222 ). L-arginine also increases gastrin concentrations and inhibits tubular reabsorption of protein ( 3331 , 3460 , 8015 ). L-arginine can increase renal plasma flow and decrease renal vascular resistance, and increase glomerular filtration rate, natriuresis, kaliuresis, and creatinine clearance in some patients ( 7822 , 31839 , 31860 , 31879 , 31904 , 31910 , 31962 , 32062 , 32224 , 32251 )( 32284 , 104222 ). Heavy metal protective effects L-arginine may have protective effects for heavy metal exposure. In animals, L-arginine appears to reduce mercury accumulation in the thymus after exposure to mercury ( 32058 ). Hormonal effects Physiologic actions of L-arginine include stimulating the release of growth hormone (GH), prolactin, glucagon, and insulin ( 7820 , 31862 ). L-arginine also increases levels of testosterone in males ( 102586 , 104222 ). Immunological effects L-arginine enhances immune function in laboratory research, as well as in human research when given with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ( 5532 , 5533 , 7819 , 32036 , 32109 , 32192 ). In patients with colorectal cancer, L-arginine improved cellular and humoral immune activity via an increase in CD4+ T cells and IgA, IgG, and IgM levels, ( 117114 ). However, in elderly immunocompromised nursing home residents with pressure ulcers, L-arginine supplementation did not appear to improve or worsen immune function ( 31863 , 31946 ). Supplementing sickle cell patients with L-arginine also did not result in notable improvement in immune function ( 32171 ). Neurological effects L-arginine may have neuroprotective effects. In an animal amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model, L-arginine protected motor neurons from injury, delayed onset of motor dysfunction, and prolonged life span. This protective effect may be attributed to preservation of arginase I activity and neuroprotective polyamines in the spinal cord ( 32088 ). Nutrigenomics The arginase 1 (ARG1) and arginase 2 (ARG2) genes may impact the bioavailability of L-arginine in humans. Observational research in L-arginine supplement users found that a higher prevalence of the minor allele of ARG1 rs2246012 is associated with higher blood L-arginine concentrations. Genetic variation in ARG1 may impact L-arginine absorption. Genetic variation in ARG2 genes may impact arginine levels in adults that do not take L-arginine supplements ( 105061 ). Ocular effects In healthy volunteers, L-arginine increases choroidal blood flow and retinal vein blood flow which may be helpful for patients with glaucoma ( 31948 ). Pulmonary effects Inhaling L-arginine increases the production of nitric oxide in the lungs. Orally, animal models show L-arginine decreases airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. However, in humans, L-arginine does not seem to reduce inflammation or improve lung function ( 96807 , 104223 ). Reproductive effects L-arginine has been used to help with infertility. Laboratory research suggests that nitric oxide from L-arginine may stimulate motility and metabolism of sperm from asthenospermic patients ( 32163 ). L-arginine supplementation affects nitric oxide production and improves uterine blood flow and endometrial thickness in females ( 104224 ). Weight loss effects L-arginine has been studied for weight loss in obese patients ( 91193 ). In animals, dietary L-arginine appears to increase lipolysis in adipose tissue ( 32173 ). Some human research suggests that L-arginine can increase the production of postprandial hormones involved in appetite suppression, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) ( 110397 ). Wound-healing effects L-arginine is metabolized to L-ornithine, then to L-proline, which is used in collagen synthesis and wound healing ( 14914 ). L-arginine is a precursor for collagen synthesis and together with fibroblast NO production is thought to be important for wound healing ( 3259 , 3260 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Possibly Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/L-Arginine</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Angina. Oral L-arginine seems to improve symptoms and exercise tolerance in patients with angina. Clinical research shows that taking L-arginine orally seems to decrease symptoms and improve exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with mild to severe angina ( 3593 , 7815 , 7816 , 31866 , 31923 ). Some patients with severe angina who have frequent attacks at rest despite treatment with standard antianginal agents might also benefit from L-arginine ( 3593 ). However, L-arginine does not seem to improve objective measures of blood vessel dilation or increase circulating concentrations of nitric oxide ( 7817 , 99262 ). Also, when used in combination with ten 200 mcg injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-165 plasmid DNA, L-arginine 6 grams daily orally for 3 months does not improve angina severity in patients with coronary artery disease who underwent surgical angiogenesis compared to patients who did not receive this combination ( 32001 ). In addition, intravenous infusion of arginine 10% solution does not improve exercise capacity in patients with stable angina when compared with placebo ( 31843 , 32293 ). more Erectile dysfunction (ED). Oral L-arginine might improve symptoms of ED. When taken with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, L-arginine seems to provide a small additional benefit. Taking L-arginine orally in high doses, 5 grams daily, improves subjective assessment of sexual function in males with organic ED when compared with placebo ( 222 , 102586 ). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 4 small clinical studies in patients with ED, including those with diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease risk factors, shows that although PDE5 inhibitors improve sexual function better than L-arginine, the combination of PDE5 inhibitors and L-arginine may be more effective than either treatment alone ( 105065 ). In most clinical trials, doses of L-arginine 2.5-5 mg daily for 6-12 weeks were used alone or in addition to PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil 50 mg or tadalafil 5-10 mg daily ( 102586 , 102587 , 102592 , 104222 ). Higher doses have also been investigated. One clinical trial shows that taking L-arginine (Bioarginina, Farmaceutici Damor S.p.A., Napoli, Italy), 2 grams three times daily for 3 months improves sexual function compared with placebo ( 110387 ). However, taking lower doses, 1.5 grams daily, might not be effective in patients with mixed-type ED ( 2038 ). L-arginine has also been examined in combination with other ingredients. A meta-analysis of 2 small clinical studies in males with mild-to-moderate ED shows that taking L- arginine, up to 3 grams daily, in combination with maritime pine for 1-6 months improves a subjective assessment of sexual function when compared with control ( 112715 ). Some preliminary clinical evidence suggests that taking L-arginine orally in low doses, 1.7 grams daily in combination with maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) or taking 0.69 grams daily along with maritime pine bark extract and aspartic acid (Edicare, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) modestly improves symptoms of ED ( 10416 , 50924 ). Another preliminary clinical trial has investigated the effects of a combination of L-arginine 2.5 grams daily for 6 months and tadalafil 5 mg daily for 3 months, both starting with the initiation of weekly extracorporeal shock wave (ESW) therapy. When compared with ESW alone, this combination modestly improves sexual function for up to 12 months ( 110388 ). The effect of L-arginine alone is not clear from these studies. more Hypertension. Oral L-arginine can modestly reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Oral L-arginine seems to have additive vasodilating effects when used with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or nitrate vasodilators such as isosorbide mononitrate ( 7822 , 20192 , 31916 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research in a variety of populations shows that taking L-arginine reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP; DPB) by an average of 6.40 mmHg and 2.64 mmHg, respectively. Sub-analyses show that these reductions occur in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals. Beneficial effects were limited to adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 19.9 kg/m 2 ( 110384 ). The effect of L-arginine on blood pressure levels in adults exposed to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) has also been investigated. Clinical research in adults with hypertension shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams three times daily for 2 weeks modestly reduces SBP and DBP elevations following a 2-hour exposure to TRAP during an outdoor walk compared with taking placebo ( 110383 ). Doses have included 4-24 grams daily, with the best evidence of benefit for doses of less than 9 grams daily, for 2-24 weeks ( 7818 , 10636 , 31871 , 31923 , 32167 , 32201 , 110383 , 110384 ). more Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Oral L-arginine may help prevent NEC in premature infants. In a meta-analysis of 3 clinical trials, L-arginine 260 mg/kg orally in a single dose or two divided doses daily reduces the absolute risk of NEC in premature infants by about 62% when compared with placebo. To prevent one case of NEC, 6 infants would need to be treated with L-arginine ( 8474 , 91194 , 96803 ). more Peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Short-term use of intravenous or oral L-arginine may improve symptoms of PAD, but long-term use does not seem to be beneficial. Clinical research shows that using L-arginine intravenously or orally for up to 8 weeks increases flow-mediated dilation and improves symptoms of intermittent claudication associated with PAD ( 3465 , 31857 , 31905 ). However, long-term administration of L-arginine orally for up to 6 months does not improve walking speed, walking distance, or absolute claudication distance in patients with PAD and intermittent claudication ( 31957 , 31985 ). more Pre-eclampsia. Intravenous L-arginine may have beneficial effects in pre-eclampsia. However, it is unclear if oral L-arginine is effective. One small clinical study shows that intravenous L-arginine 30 grams as a one-time dose decreases systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 11 mmHg when compared to baseline in pregnant patients with hypertension or pre-eclampsia ( 31847 ), while intravenous L-arginine 20 grams daily for 5 days decreases SBP and DBP by about 2% when compared with placebo ( 31978 ). Another small clinical study shows that oral use of L-arginine 3 grams daily for 3 weeks reduces SBP and DBP by around 7 and 5 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 31938 ); however, taking L-arginine 12 grams daily by mouth for 5 days does not seem to improve blood pressure in these patients ( 11828 ). Another preliminary clinical trial allowing for both oral and intravenous dosing shows that taking L-arginine 3.5 grams by mouth every 6 hours or 10 grams via intravenous infusion every 8 hours shortly before or immediately after delivery and continuing until postpartum day 3 does not improve blood pressure when compared with placebo ( 31959 ). The reasons for the disparate findings are unclear, but the small study sizes, as well as variations in the dose, duration, and timing of therapy before and/or after delivery, may explain some of the differences. Oral L-arginine has also been evaluated for the prevention of pre-eclampsia. One clinical study in patients at high risk for pre-eclampsia shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams daily starting the 20th week of gestation reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia by about 74% when compared with placebo ( 96811 ). Based on these results, one case of pre-eclampsia is prevented for every 6 high-risk pregnant patients treated with L-arginine 3 grams daily. Another clinical study also shows that taking two bars of a specific medical food (Heart Bars, Nellson Nutraceutical) containing L-arginine 6.6 grams and antioxidant vitamins daily starting at 14-32 weeks gestation and continuing until delivery reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia by 44% when compared with a bar containing antioxidant vitamins alone in patients at high risk of pre-eclampsia ( 91197 ). Based on these results, one case of pre-eclampsia is prevented for every 11 high risk patients treated with this L-arginine-containing medical food. more Pregnancy-induced hypertension. Intravenous L-arginine may have beneficial effects in pregnancy-induced hypertension. Some clinical research in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension shows that intravenous infusion of L-arginine 20 grams daily for up to 5 days decreases systolic blood pressure by 2% to 3% and diastolic blood pressure by about 3% when compared with placebo ( 31933 , 31961 , 31978 ). Clinical research in patients with pre-existing hypertension has also been conducted. One clinical trial shows that taking L-arginine 4 grams by mouth daily for 10-12 weeks does not seem to reduce blood pressure in those with pre-existing hypertension or mild gestational hypertension. However, these results are confounded by the fact that more patients taking placebo needed to be placed on antihypertensive therapy during the study. L-arginine reduced the risk of being placed on antihypertensive drug therapy during the pregnancy by 47% when compared with placebo ( 32191 ). Based on this study, for every 5 patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension treated with L-arginine over placebo, antihypertensive drug therapy is avoided in one additional patient. L-arginine has also been investigated in combination with other ingredients in patients with pre-existing hypertension. Preliminary clinical research in patients with pre-existing hypertension and a previous history of pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), or other placenta vascular disorder shows that taking L-arginine and other ingredients starting at 14 weeks gestation prevents an increase in blood pressure and reduces the percentage of patients requiring new antihypertensive medication by about 73% compared with 24.5% of those not taking this combination. In this study, L-arginine 3 grams daily was taken with magnesium 350 mg and salicylate 100 mg. Therefore, the effect of L-arginine alone is unclear. All patients in the study were taking low dose aspirin 100 mg daily ( 110382 ). more Possibly Ineffective Chronic kidney disease (CKD). Oral or intravenous L-arginine does not seem to improve CKD. Most preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine, either orally for up to 6 months or intravenously short-term, does not improve kidney function, glomerular filtration rate, or renal plasma flow in patients with CKD, although proteinuria may be reduced in some patients ( 31844 , 31904 , 32235 , 32303 ). more Hypercholesterolemia. Oral L-arginine does not seem to reduce cholesterol levels. Preliminary clinical research in patients with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking L-arginine 21 grams daily for 4 weeks does not reduce plasma lipids ( 1363 ). Furthermore, meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking L-arginine for up to about 6 months does not reduce total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in populations of healthy individuals or those with cardiovascular disease risk factors. However, there was a very small effect on fasting triglyceride levels ( 102590 , 102591 ). more Myocardial infarction (MI). Oral L-arginine does not seem to improve outcomes after MI. Patients who have had an ST-segment MI who take L-arginine within 24 hours to 21 days, titrated up to a dose of 3 grams three times a day for up to 6 months, do not seem to have reduced vascular stiffness or increased ejection fraction ( 13221 , 32137 ). Also, there is some concern that long-term use of L-arginine might actually worsen outcomes and increase mortality in these patients ( 13221 ). Population studies also suggest that intake of L-arginine does not reduce the risk of experiencing an acute coronary event such as MI or coronary heart disease-related mortality ( 3332 , 6896 , 7821 , 10637 ). more Tuberculosis. Oral L-arginine does not seem to improve symptoms or the clearance of tuberculosis infection. Clinical research shows that taking L-arginine (ArgimaxH) 6 grams daily orally for 8 weeks, with or without vitamin D, does not improve symptoms of tuberculosis or the clearance of tuberculosis infection when used with standard treatment ( 91196 ). more Wound healing. Oral L-arginine does not seem to improve wound healing. Clinical research shows that taking L-arginine (as arginine aspartate) 17 grams orally in three divided doses daily for 2 weeks does not improve epithelialization in healthy, elderly patients with catheter wounds, although it may improve collagen deposition ( 32247 ). Also, taking L-arginine (as L-arginine hydrochloride) 26 grams daily for 5 days perioperatively does not improve angiogenesis, re-epithelialization, or neutrophil count in patients undergoing skin graft donation when compared with placebo ( 20692 ). In addition, taking a wound-specific oral nutrition supplement containing L-arginine 4.5 grams, zinc, and vitamin C twice daily for 4 weeks, along with standard wound care for 8 weeks, is no more effective for wound healing than a standard oral nutrition supplement along with standard wound care ( 90198 ). L-arginine has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. Taking L-arginine enterally or orally, before or after surgery, in combination with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and either eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or fish oil, seems to improve wound healing when compared with a control group ( 5531 , 32174 ). Another observational study conducted in Italy in newborns shows that applying a specific topical powder containing L-arginine, arnica extract, zinc oxide, and other ingredients (Cicaben, Orsana Italia S.r.l.) to the newborn's umbilical cord stump 3 to 4 times daily until stump detachment reduces the rates of mild complications 48 hours after discharge such as a wet cord stump but does not change the time to cord stump detachment or the rates of purulent secretions or umbilical granulomas when compared with standard dry care. However, no differences were noted between the groups one week after discharge ( 113662 ). The validity of these results is limited by the observational nature of the study and the ability of the parents to select a treatment group. It is unclear if the effects in these studies are due to L-arginine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may prevent ARDS. A meta-analysis of three small studies shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams daily, starting in the second or third trimester usually until delivery, reduces the risk of ARDS in the infant by about 54% when compared to control, including placebo or no treatment ( 110379 ). more Altitude sickness. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with altitude sickness. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 4 grams orally three times daily for 2 days while ascending to a high altitude and for 24 hours while at high altitude does not reduce altitude sickness when compared with placebo ( 31955 ). more Anemia of chronic disease. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. One very small clinical study in elderly adults with chronic kidney disease and anemia shows that taking L-arginine orally 1.3 grams daily might increase hemoglobin and erythropoietin levels in some patients when compared to baseline ( 31988 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and the lack of a comparator group. more Anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Although there is interest in using oral L-arginine for anthracycline cardiotoxicity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for this purpose. Asthma. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with asthma. Preliminary clinical research in adults with severe asthma shows that taking L-arginine 0.05 gram/kg ideal body weight twice daily does not reduce asthma exacerbations when compared with placebo ( 104223 ). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in exacerbation rates between groups. While other studies have shown adverse airway effects in patients with asthma ( 121 , 31849 ), this study demonstrated no change in exacerbations and reported no adverse airway effects. more Athletic performance. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may improve measures of athletic performance. A meta-analysis of 5 small clinical trials shows that taking L-arginine seems to modestly improve measures of cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by a 0.07 L/minute increase in maximal oxygen uptake, when compared with control ( 105064 ). L-arginine has also been examined for its effects on athletic performance. Most research suggests that taking L-arginine does not improve athletic performance. However, clinical trials are small and may not be adequately powered to detect a difference in these outcomes Taking L-arginine as a single dose of 5 or 6 grams or as 5-10 grams daily for 2-4 weeks does not improve grip strength, strength during resistance exercise, power output during cycling, or muscle function during recovery from intense resistance exercise in healthy adults ( 91190 , 97393 , 99265 , 110381 , 110389 ). Also, taking L-arginine 5 grams daily for 4 weeks (Bioarginina Farmaceutici Damor) or 8 grams daily for 8 days does not increase swim speed ( 110381 , 110386 ). In contrast, some research suggests that drinking a single beverage containing the same dose of L-arginine 6 grams increases the time to exhaustion during high-intensity exercise when compared with placebo ( 32180 ). Also, a meta-analysis of small clinical trials shows that supplementation with L-arginine has a large beneficial effect on aerobic performance and a small beneficial effect on anaerobic performance. However, publication bias was evident in the aerobic performance data, limiting these conclusions. Doses found to be beneficial in this analysis included an acute dose of L-arginine 0.15 gram/kg 60-90 minutes before performance or chronic dosing of 1.5 grams to 2 grams daily for 4-7 weeks for aerobic performance. The chronic dose of L-arginine most likely to be beneficial for anaerobic performance is unclear from this analysis due to inclusion of studies using arginine alpha-ketoglutarate ( 110395 ). With the exception of a few studies which include a very small number of healthy females ( 99265 , 110395 , 110386 ), research on the use of L-arginine for athletic performance has focused almost exclusively on healthy males. Also, studies are heterogeneous with respect to sport and endpoints. Therefore, whether results can be applied to females or specific athletes is unclear. L-arginine has also been evaluated in overweight males. One small clinical study shows that taking a single dose of L-arginine 6 grams 90 minutes prior to high-intensity interval training seems to improve exercise tolerance by improving ventilation, heart rate, and oxygen uptake when compared with placebo ( 105060 ). L-arginine has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Research in male soccer players shows that taking L-arginine 1.2 grams and L-citrulline 1.2 grams daily for 7 days increases total power output over a 10-minute cycling test and improves subjective perceptions of exertion when compared with placebo ( 100956 ). Another study shows that taking L-arginine 1.5 or 3 grams daily, in combination with grape seed extract, increases physical working capacity at fatigue threshold when compared with pretreatment in untrained, college-aged males ( 32164 ). Additionally, a study in trained athletes shows that taking L-arginine 6 grams, in combination with nitrate obtained from fresh spinach, 3 hours prior to exercise improves peak power, average power, and agility when compared with placebo ( 116207 ). It is unclear if these benefits are due to L-arginine, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Beta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in children with beta-thalassemia. Preliminary clinical research in children aged 6-18 years treated conventionally for pulmonary hypertension related to beta-thalassemia shows that taking L-arginine 0.1 mg/kg daily for 60 days reduces Doppler echocardiography pulmonary arterial pressure by 35% compared with baseline. This measurement was increased by up to 15% in children given conventional treatments only; however, a statistical comparison between these treatment groups was lacking ( 110391 ). more Breast cancer. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with breast cancer. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 30 grams daily for 3 days prior to chemotherapy does not improve the clinical response rate in breast cancer patients when compared with placebo ( 32282 ). more Cognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with cognitive impairment. A small clinical trial in frail adults aged 65 years of age and up with hypertension shows that taking L-arginine (Bioarginina) 1.66 grams twice daily for 4 weeks modestly improves cognitive function when compared to placebo ( 110385 ). more Congestive heart failure (CHF). It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with CHF. One small clinical study in patients with CHF stage 2-3 shows that taking L-arginine 15 grams daily for 5 days, in combination with conventional treatment, seems to improve glomerular filtration rate (GFR), creatinine clearance, and sodium and water elimination after saline loading, indicating an improvement in kidney function ( 3596 ). more Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for preventing complications after CABG surgery. Preliminary clinical research shows that venous infusion of L-arginine hydrochloride 30 grams as a 10% solution over 15 minutes helps maintain mean arterial pressure, coronary vascular resistance, and graft blood flow when compared with a placebo infusion in patients that have undergone CABG ( 31840 ). Administering L-arginine 7.5 grams in 500 mL of cardioplegic solution also seems to reduce wedge pressure and intensive care unit stay in patients undergoing CABG; however, it does not reduce hospital stay duration or postoperative complications when compared with cardioplegic solution alone ( 31958 , 31886 ). more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. A small clinical trial in patients with severe COVID-19 shows that receiving oral L-arginine (Argin, Nutrigrow, India) 3 grams daily for a maximum of 10 days while on oxygen support does not affect the percentage of patients weaned off oxygen support after 10 days, the length of time requiring oxygen support, the duration of hospitalization, or the incidence of adverse thrombotic events, compared with placebo ( 110392 ). This study may not have been adequately powered to detect differences between groups. An interim analysis of a small clinical trial in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 shows that adding oral L-arginine (Bioarginina, Farmaceutici Damor) 1.66 grams twice daily to standard therapy throughout hospitalization increases the rate of respiratory support reduction by 60% after 10 days of therapy, but not after 20 days of therapy, when compared with placebo. L-arginine also significantly reduced the length of hospital stay. The median hospital stay was 25 days and 46 days, respectively, for L-arginine and placebo ( 106500 ). L-arginine has also been investigated in combination with other ingredients for post-acute COVID symptoms. Preliminary clinical research in adults with persistent fatigue following a COVID infection shows that taking L-arginine 1.66 grams plus vitamin C 500 mg (Bioarginina C, Farmaceutici Damor) twice daily for 28 days increases the distance walked in 6 minutes by 30 meters and reduces the percentage of patients with fatigue by about 89%, when compared with placebo. Grip strength was also increased ( 110390 ). more Critical illness (trauma). Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone are unclear. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking L-arginine orally with glutamine, nucleotides, and omega-3 fatty acids reduces the recovery time, the need for ventilation, and infection rates in critically ill patients, but does not reduce the risk of mortality ( 31853 ). more Cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity. Although there is interest in using oral L-arginine for cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for this purpose. Cystic fibrosis. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with cystic fibrosis. Preliminary clinical research in teens and adults with cystic fibrosis shows that twice daily inhalation with L-arginine 500 mg for 2 weeks does not improve lung function when compared with inhaling 2.6% hypertonic saline twice daily ( 96807 ). more Dental caries. Small clinical studies suggest that using a dentifrice containing L-arginine might prevent dental caries. A meta-analysis of small studies shows that use of a dentifrice containing L-arginine 1.5% w/w in combination with calcium base (Dical or calcium carbonate) and fluoride 1450 ppm 2-3 times daily for up to 2 years reduces the risk of developing dental caries by a small to moderate amount when compared with a dentifrice containing only fluoride in children and adults ( 96806 ). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that using a confection containing an L-arginine complex (CaviStat) for one year reduces the number of dental caries in molars of children when compared with a sugarless mint control ( 32011 ). L-arginine has also been investigated as a prebiotic in combination with probiotics. In 5- to 9-year-old children with low caries risk, clinical research shows that taking one lozenge daily for 10-12 months containing arginine 20 mg along with Lacticaseibacillus paracasei and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, modestly reduces caries severity, but does not reduce caries progression, active caries lesions, plaque, or gingivitis, when compared with placebo ( 113241 , 113242 ). more Dental hypersensitivity. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that using a toothpaste containing L-arginine, calcium, and fluoride twice daily reduces dentin hypersensitivity when compared with pretreatment or control ( 32130 , 32131 , 32132 , 32177 ). However, a small clinical study in adults shows that applying a paste containing L-arginine 8%, calcium carbonate, and potassium nitrate twice for 30 minutes does not reduce sensitivity when compared with control ( 117116 ). Another clinical study in adults shows that applying a topical combination of L-arginine 10% and ibuprofen to tooth enamel surfaces for 10 minutes prior to in-office tooth bleaching reduces the risk and intensity of tooth sensitivity when compared with placebo ( 115354 ). It is unclear whether the effects are due to L-arginine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Depression. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in adults with depression. A small, single-center clinical study in Iran in adult females with major depressive disorder taking an antidepressant shows that adding L-arginine (Made, Jalinous Pharmaceutical Company) 2 grams daily for 4 weeks does not improve symptoms of depression when compared with placebo ( 116205 ). more Diabetes. Small, low-quality studies suggest that oral L-arginine does not improve glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis of small, low-quality studies shows that taking L-arginine 2-20 grams daily for up to 77 weeks decreases fasting blood glucose and serum insulin levels in adults without diabetes. However, no improvements occurred in adults WITH type 2 diabetes. This may be explained by previous studies which suggest L-arginine affects glucose control only in the early steps of beta-cell dysfunction. L-arginine did not improve insulin resistance or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with or without diabetes ( 104225 ). Also, a prospective observational study in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes has found that taking a specific product (Flebotrofine, AMNOL Chimica Biologica) containing L-arginine for 3 months is not associated with improvements in HbA1c, cholesterol, or triglyceride levels when compared with baseline. Other ingredients in this product included diosmin, troxerutin, hesperidin, black currant extract, and gotu kola extract ( 108151 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Diabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if oral or subcutaneous L-arginine is beneficial in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. A very small clinical study shows that administering L-arginine subcutaneously at the site of diabetic foot ulcers does not decrease healing time or rate of amputation when combined with conventional therapies ( 14914 ). Also, taking a specific drink containing L-arginine 7 grams, L-glutamine 7 grams, and calcium hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 1.5 grams (Juven/Abound, Abbott Nutrition) orally twice daily for 16 weeks does not improve diabetic foot ulcer healing when compared with a control drink in non-ischemic patients or those with normal albumin levels. However, in specific populations with low albumin and/or poor limb perfusion, up to 74% more patients had total wound healing when compared with the control drink ( 96637 ). more Diabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams daily for 3 months does not improve circulation, disability, or nerve function in patients with diabetic neuropathy when compared with placebo ( 32145 ). more Head and neck cancer. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with head and neck cancer. Small clinical studies suggest that enteral nutrition supplemented with L-arginine does not seem to have any beneficial effects on markers of immune function such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), length of postoperative hospital stay, or fistula rates; however, it seems to reduce wounds and general infections after surgery in patients with head and neck cancer when compared with control ( 10160 , 32008 ). more Heart failure. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with heart failure. Preliminary clinical research in adults with heart failure shows that taking L-arginine 3.0-12.6 grams orally daily for 6-12 weeks does not consistently improve exercise tolerance or peripheral vascular resistance ( 3595 , 6028 , 32138 ). However, some research shows that taking L-arginine 1000 mg three times daily for 10 weeks modestly improves measures of cardiac function compared with placebo ( 110380 ). Although some research disagrees ( 32138 ), most research shows that taking L-arginine modestly improves quality of life ( 3595 , 110380 ). more Heart transplant complications. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients that have received a heart transplant. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 6 grams orally twice daily for 6 weeks increases walking distance and oxygen uptake and delays the ventilatory threshold in heart transplant patients when compared with baseline ( 32150 ). more HIV/AIDS-related wasting. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. One clinical study in patients with HIV/AIDS shows that taking L-arginine orally, in combination with hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) and glutamine for 8 weeks, increases body weight, particularly lean body mass, and positively affects immune status when compared with placebo ( 1909 ). However, other clinical research in HIV-positive patients shows that taking L-arginine 7.4 grams daily orally, in combination with omega-3 fatty acids and a balanced oral nutritional supplement for 6 months, does not improve body weight or fat mass, total energy intake, or immune status when compared to taking the nutritional supplement alone ( 113 ). more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral L-arginine can prevent the development of type 2 diabetes in adults with prediabetes. Clinical research shows that taking L-arginine (Bioarginine, Farmaceutici Damor) 3.2 grams orally twice daily for 18 months does not reduce the incidence of diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). However, when assessed one year after treatment discontinuation, patients who took L-arginine had a 58% lower risk of developing diabetes when compared with placebo ( 91195 ). more Infertility. It is unclear if oral L-arginine improves outcomes in people undergoing an assisted reproductive technology (ART) program. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 16 grams daily decreases the cancellation rate of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and increases the number of oocytes collected in females undergoing an ART program when compared with control. However, taking L-arginine does not seem to improve the number of viable pregnancies ( 31842 ). A small clinical study of females undergoing an ART program shows that taking a combination product containing L-arginine 1 gram with folate 200 mcg or L-arginine 2 grams, folate 400 mcg, and vitamin E 10 mg daily for 12 weeks does not affect the hCG-positive rate or clinical pregnancy rate when compared with placebo. A subgroup analysis suggests that taking these combination products might improve HCG-positive and clinical pregnancy rates in females who are undergoing ART due to male infertility ( 104224 ). However, this small study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in these outcomes, limiting the validity of these findings. more Interstitial cystitis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may improve pain in interstitial cystitis. Taking L-arginine orally seems to reduce some symptoms, especially pain, that are associated with interstitial cystitis ( 107 , 114 , 3460 , 31855 , 32267 ). Research shows that patients with interstitial cystitis having a bladder capacity greater than 800 mL and/or a history of recurrent genitourinary infections might respond more favorably to L-arginine than patients with bladder capacity less than 800 mL and/or no history of recurrent genitourinary infections. Three months of treatment may be necessary before significant symptom improvement occurs ( 3460 ). However, L-arginine does not seem to reduce the need to urinate at night or improve urgency or frequency of urination ( 3460 , 31855 ). more Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Small clinical studies suggest that oral or intravenous L-arginine may increase birthweight in IUGR. A meta-analysis of mainly small studies shows that L-arginine given orally or intravenously in the third trimester for a time period of 7 days or until delivery increases the birthweight by up to 650 grams in patients with an IUGR pregnancy. Furthermore, there is evidence from a small number of these studies that L-arginine supplementation decreases the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and fetal intracranial hemorrhage ( 96804 ). A more recent meta-analysis of small studies also shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams daily, starting in the second or third trimester usually until delivery, reduces the risk of an IUGR infant by about 32% when compared to control, including placebo or no treatment ( 110379 ). Doses used in clinical research have usually been 3 grams daily orally, although some studies have used up to 20 grams intravenously ( 31930 , 31937 , 96804 , 110379 ). However, supplementation with L-arginine does not seem to increase birthweight or reduce neonatal mortality or morbidity when compared with placebo in patients with severe IUGR ( 32083 ). more Kidney transplant. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may not improve kidney function in patients after kidney transplantation. Although preliminary clinical research showed some benefit, evidence from other clinical research shows that infusion with L-arginine does not increase renal plasma flow or glomerular filtration rate in kidney transplant patients treated with cyclosporine, including those experiencing transplant dysfunction ( 112 , 31876 , 32229 ). Other evidence suggests that intravenous L-arginine improves kidney function only in transplant patients receiving organs with a short cold ischemia time or those receiving kidneys from young donors ( 31887 ). more Male infertility. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in males with infertility. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 4 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve semen quality in males with oligospermia when compared with placebo ( 32209 ). However, one small clinical study shows that a specific formulation of L-arginine aspartate and maritime pine bark extract (Prelox), taken for 6 months, improves sperm quality in males with idiopathic male infertility when compared to baseline ( 32061 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if this effect is due to L-arginine, maritime pine bark, or the combination. more Migraine headache. Although there is interest in using oral L-arginine for migraine, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for this condition. Mitochondrial myopathies. Small clinical studies suggest that intravenous L-arginine may modestly improve symptoms in patients with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome). Preliminary clinical research shows that infusions of L-arginine, 0.5 grams/kg administered within one hour of stroke-like symptoms, improves headaches, nausea, vomiting, transient blindness, and the appearance of bright spots when compared to pretreatment in patients with MELAS ( 31943 , 99263 ). Also, taking oral L-arginine 4-24 grams daily for 18 months seems to reduce the frequency and severity of stroke-like symptoms associated with MELAS when compared to baseline ( 31943 ). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking oral L-arginine 0.3-0.5 grams/kg daily in three divided doses for 2 years does not reduce the severity of MELAS symptoms, including migraine and stroke-like episodes. If a stroke-like episode did occur, administration of intravenous L-arginine 0.5 grams/kg improved headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbance ( 99263 ). The validity of this research is limited by the small study sizes and the absence of comparator groups. more Muscular dystrophy. There is limited evidence on the oral use of L-arginine in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A very small study in five children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, shows that drinking a beverage containing L-arginine hydrochloride (L-Arginine Hydrochloride, Selectchemie) 2.5 grams three times daily, in addition to metformin 250 mg twice daily, for 16 weeks improves motor function by 4% and increases distance walked in two minutes by 9.6 meters when compared to baseline ( 96805 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the very small study size and lack of a comparator group. more Nitrate tolerance. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for nitrate tolerance. A very small crossover study in adults with stable angina shows that taking L-arginine orally 700 mg four times daily for up to 10 days seems to prevent tolerance to transdermal nitrate when compared with placebo ( 8475 ). more Obesity. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may be beneficial for weight loss. A meta-analysis of mainly small clinical trials shows that taking L-arginine daily for at least 8 weeks modestly reduces body weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference when compared with placebo. However, when taking L-arginine for less than 8 weeks, BMI and body weight were not affected. The optimal dose of L-arginine was 2-6 grams ( 110398 ). An additional small clinical study suggests that taking a specific arginine supplement (NOW Foods) 3 grams by mouth three times daily for 12 weeks, in addition to receiving dietary counseling, reduces waist circumference by 4-6 cm and reduces body weight by 1.8-2.9 kg when compared to baseline in obese females 18-40 years of age ( 91193 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Oral mucositis. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. One small clinical study shows that taking a specific combination of L-arginine 7 grams, L-glutamine 7 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 1.2 grams (Abound; Abbott) in water twice daily during chemoradiotherapy treatment for head and neck cancer does not reduce the incidence of severe oral mucositis when compared with a historical control ( 99243 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a placebo control. Additionally, a small open-label study in patients undergoing chemoradiation for head and neck cancer shows that taking a specific combination product (Abound, Abbot) containing L-arginine, glutamine, and HMB twice daily throughout chemoradiation treatments decreases the incidence of grade 3 or higher oral mucositis and ameliorates body weight loss when compared with no intervention ( 113726 ). However, the incidence of grade 2 or higher oral mucositis was not reduced. It is unclear if this effect is due to L-arginine, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of the study is limited by the lack of blinding. more Pain (acute). Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A single-center clinical study in adults in Brazil undergoing dental surgery shows that taking L-arginine 555 mg with ibuprofen 30 minutes prior to receiving an alveolar nerve block increases the number of nerve blocks associated with no pain or only mild pain when compared with placebo, but not when compared with ibuprofen ( 117115 ). more Periodontitis. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with periodontitis. Preliminary clinical research in patients with chronic periodontitis shows that using L-arginine aspartate (Yuria-Pharm, Ukraine) 1 gram three times daily orally for 10 days after scaling and root planing, modestly reduces bleeding on probing but not periodontal pocket depth, when compared with untreated controls ( 108926 ). more Physical performance. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for improving physical performance in older adults. A small study in physically active females 65 years of age and older shows that taking L-arginine 8 grams as a single dose does not improve lower body strength, measured by knee flexion and extension tests, or functional performance, measured by sit-stand, tandem gait, and timed up-and-go tests, when compared with placebo ( 96812 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of N-acetylcysteine 1200 mg daily plus L-arginine 1600 mg daily for 6 months modestly improves menstrual function and decreases insulin resistance in patients with PCOS when compared to baseline ( 32094 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Postoperative infection. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Small clinical studies show that taking L-arginine, enterally or orally, either before or after surgery, in combination with fish oil, or with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), seems to reduce the rate of perioperative infection when compared with a control group. The risk of infection was 41% lower when compared to taking no arginine-based formulations. However, there is no good evidence to support the use of L-arginine alone for this purpose, and it is possible that this effect is due to the other ingredients or the combination of ingredients ( 5531 , 32174 , 32196 ). more Postoperative pain. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small, single-center clinical study in adults in Brazil undergoing dental surgery shows that taking L-arginine 370 mg in combination with ibuprofen prior to surgery, with or without dexamethasone, reduces the total amount of postoperative medication needed when compared with placebo. Although taking L-arginine with ibuprofen and dexamethasone reduced patient-reported pain overall, there was no difference at individual time points (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8 hours) ( 116208 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to L-arginine, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Postoperative recovery. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Small clinical studies show that taking L-arginine, enterally or orally, either before or after surgery, in combination with fish oil, or with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), seems to reduce the recovery time after surgery or serious illness when compared with a control group. This seems to be related to a reduced number of perioperative infections and improved wound healing. However, there is no good evidence to support the use of L-arginine alone for this purpose, and it is possible that this effect is due to the other ingredients or the combination of ingredients ( 5531 , 32174 , 32196 ). Additionally, 2 small single-center clinical studies in Japan and Iran in adults show that taking a combination of L-arginine 7-14 grams, glutamine 7-14 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate 1.5-3 grams (Heallagen or Abound) daily for 2-4 weeks before heart surgery reduces hospital stay by 1-4 days and intensive care unit stay by 1 day when compared with control ( 110394 , 116206 ). Additionally, walking distance was improved after surgery ( 116206 ). Furthermore, recovery, based on some biochemical and other measurements, was improved, but there was no difference in overall postoperative complications ( 110394 ). However, in another clinical study, taking a combination product (Abound, Abbott) containing L-arginine 7 grams, glutamine 7 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate 1.2 grams orally daily for 3 days before and 7 days after abdominal surgery did not reduce the incidence of wound infection or other complications when compared with placebo ( 99413 ). The discrepancies between these studies may be related to differences in the dose or duration of the combination product, the outcomes measured, and/or the type of surgery. more Pressure ulcers. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Oral L-arginine has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for the treatment of grade II-IV pressure ulcers. Two small clinical studies in hospitalized patients show that administering an oral nutritional supplement enriched with L-arginine, zinc, and vitamin C improves ulcer healing when compared with a standard diet ( 31953 , 87173 ). A small, retrospective study in sedentary older adults in care facilities shows that taking a specific nutritional supplement (Abound, Abbott) containing L-arginine 7.4 grams, L-glutamine 7.4 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 1.3 grams twice daily until the complete healing of the pressure ulcer reduces time to complete healing to 170 days on average, compared with 218 days on average in the control group ( 110396 ). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients living in long-term care facilities with grade II-IV pressure ulcers shows that taking an oral nutritional supplement enriched in protein, energy, L-arginine, vitamin C, and zinc daily for 9 weeks reduces ulcer area and decreases oozing when compared to baseline ( 32045 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Preterm labor. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may prevent preterm labor. A meta-analysis of three small studies shows that taking L-arginine 3-6.6 grams daily, starting in the second or third trimester usually until delivery, reduces the risk of preterm labor by about 50% when compared to control, usually placebo ( 110379 ). more Pulmonary hypertension. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in children with pulmonary hypertension related to beta-thalassemia. Preliminary clinical research in children aged 6-18 years treated conventionally for pulmonary hypertension related to beta-thalassemia shows that taking L-arginine 0.1 mg/kg daily for 60 days reduces Doppler echocardiography pulmonary arterial pressure by 35% compared with baseline. This measurement was increased by up to 15% in children given conventional treatments only; however, a statistical comparison between these treatment groups was lacking ( 110391 ). more Radiation dermatitis. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with head and neck cancer shows that taking a combination of L-arginine 7 grams, L-glutamine 7 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 1.2 grams (Abound, Abbott) in water twice daily from the first day of radiation to approximately 1 week after completion does not reduce the number of patients with severe dermatitis when compared with taking no supplement. However, there was a 34% reduction in the incidence of moderate dermatitis and the overall duration of dermatitis was reduced ( 96639 ). more Respiratory tract infections. Although there is interest in using oral L-arginine for respiratory tract infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for these conditions. Restenosis. It is unclear if intravenous L-arginine helps to prevent restenosis after stent implantation. Some clinical research suggests that intravenous and intracoronary infusion of L-arginine during stent implantation followed by oral L-arginine for 2 weeks does not reduce the risk of restenosis when compared with placebo ( 31925 ). However, local delivery of 6 mL of L-arginine 100 mg/mL for 15 minutes after stent deployment seems to reduce neointimal formation at 6 months after stent placement when compared with placebo ( 31883 ). more Schizophrenia. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia. A small clinical study shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams twice daily for 3 weeks, in conjunction with an individualized medication regimen, does not improve positive, negative, or depressive symptoms associated with schizophrenia when compared with taking the medication regimen alone ( 99264 ). more Sexual dysfunction. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for sexual dysfunction in females. A small, single-center clinical study in Iran in adult females with major depressive disorder and taking an antidepressant shows that taking L-arginine (Made, Jalinous Pharmaceutical Company) 2 grams daily for 8 weeks does not improve patient-reported symptoms of sexual dysfunction (e.g., arousal, desire, lubrication) when compared with placebo ( 116205 ). However, results from combination therapy differ. Clinical research in females with sexual dysfunction who are taking oral contraceptives shows that taking a specific combination product (Lady Prelox, Horphag Research) containing L-arginine, maritime pine bark extract, L-citrulline, and rose hip extract daily for 8 weeks improves symptoms of sexual dysfunction by 18% when compared with a control group ( 91963 ). Taking the same product in a dose of 2 tablets twice daily for 8 weeks, in addition to the lifestyle management program, improves vaginal dryness in pre- and post-menopausal patients when compared with lifestyle management alone ( 103611 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to L-arginine, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Sickle cell disease. Small clinical studies suggest that oral or intravenous L-arginine may modestly improve complications in patients with sickle cell disease. Two small clinical studies in hospitalized children aged 3-19 years with sickle cell disease-related veno-occlusive crisis shows that administering L-arginine intravenously or orally 100 mg/kg three times daily for 5 days or until discharge reduces total opioid use by 26% to 54%, pain scores at discharge by 23%, and median length of hospital stay by about 36 hours when compared with placebo ( 97392 , 105063 ). Another very small clinical study in patients aged 13-63 years with sickle cell disease shows that taking L-arginine 0.1 grams/kg orally three times daily for 5 days reduces pulmonary hypertension when compared to baseline ( 11428 ). more Stress. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking a single dose of L-arginine 50 mg plus L-theanine 200 mg modestly reduces stress associated with a stress-loading test when compared with placebo, but was no more effective than taking L-theanine alone ( 110393 ). more Valproic acid-induced toxicities. Although there is interest in using intravenous L-arginine for valproic acid toxicity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for this purpose. More evidence is needed to rate L-arginine for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately.

Intravenous L-arginine 20-30 grams daily has been used safely in pregnancy for up to 5 days ( 31847 , 31933 , 31961 , 31978 ).

Endogenous carnitines exist as a "carnitine pool" consisting of L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, propionyl-L-carnitine, and several other acyl-carnitine esters. Intracellular enzymes and cell membrane transporters can rapidly interconvert the carnitines to the needed form and transport them between the tissues and extracellular space. The body obtains some carnitine from the diet, primarily from red meats and dairy products. The body can also synthesize carnitines from the amino acids, lysine and methionine. The kidney aids in keeping carnitine levels stable. Normally, greater than 90% of filtered carnitine is reabsorbed. If dietary intake of carnitines decreases, carnitine reabsorption becomes even more efficient ( 12744 ). Most L-carnitine in the body is found in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The highest concentration of L-carnitine is in the epididymal fluid ( 12352 ). L-carnitine plays a key role in cellular energy production. It is essential for beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria. To enter the mitochondria, fatty acids must bind to coenzyme A, forming fatty acyl-CoA. Long-chain fatty acyl-CoA molecules are too large to cross the internal mitochondrial membrane and rely on enzymatic transportation that requires L-carnitine. In the mitochondria, fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and L-acetyl-carnitine is excreted to begin a new transport cycle ( 12352 ). The body can convert L-carnitine to acetyl-L-carnitine and propionyl-L-carnitine. But, no one knows whether the benefits of carnitines are interchangeable ( 12744 ). Primary tissue deficiency of L-carnitine can arise from hepatic synthesis failure, membrane transport failure, or disorders of re-absorption by the kidney. It is characterized by low concentrations of L-carnitine in plasma, red blood cells and tissues ( 3616 ). L-carnitine deficiency can also occur due to other disorders, such as inborn errors of metabolism, cirrhosis, and hypopituitarism. Carnitine deficiency most often presents with symptoms of progressive cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle weakness, and less frequently with fasting hypoglycemic coma ( 12748 , 15508 ). Muscle L-carnitine deficiency has been reported in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( 3640 ), and in people with myopathies due to zidovudine ( 3618 ) or isotretinoin ( 3619 ). Increased urinary losses of L-carnitine have been reported with ifosfamide and cisplatin therapy ( 3641 , 3642 ). Low serum L-carnitine levels can occur in patients with a variety of conditions including those taking valproic acid therapy ( 1910 , 1911 , 1912 , 1913 , 4526 , 4528 ), in pregnant women ( 3643 ), those with HIV/AIDS ( 3617 ), in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) ( 58535 ), in those with asthma ( 58574 ), and in patients with hyperthyroidism ( 8047 ). The relationship between serum and tissue L-carnitine levels is not fully understood, and it is not known whether or not low serum levels necessarily lead to symptomatic deficiency ( 4528 , 4529 , 5798 ). Low L-carnitine levels have also been found in patients with fatigue related to multiple sclerosis, celiac disease, and cancer ( 16105 , 16106 , 16107 ). Some research has also found low L-carnitine levels in people with chronic fatigue syndrome ( 3630 ); however, other research has not found low L-carnitine levels in these patients ( 16108 ). Symptomatic deficiency is unlikely to arise from insufficient dietary intake since the body is usually able to synthesize adequate quantities. However, preterm neonates have a reduced capacity to synthesize L-carnitine and they may become deficient, especially if receiving total parenteral nutrition without L-carnitine supplements ( 3633 , 59106 , 59107 ). Breast milk and some formulas contain L-carnitine. Those that do not generally do not induce symptomatic deficiencies in healthy full-term infants unless a metabolic disorder is also present, although utilization of fats may be impaired ( 3644 , 59083 , 59108 ). In people with angina, a reduction in tissue L-carnitine levels has been observed during myocardial ischemia. L-carnitine can be decreased by as much as 50% in failing myocardium ( 8048 ). Decreased L-carnitine levels have also been found in persons with beta-thalassemia ( 58269 ) and polycystic ovary syndrome ( 58467 ). In patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis, serum levels of L-carnitine and its esters are sometimes increased, possibly due to increased L-carnitine biosynthesis ( 1931 , 1948 ). Anti-inflammatory effects By decreasing the formation of reactive oxygen species, L-carnitine can inhibit the nuclear factor-kappa beta pathway, leading to anti-inflammatory effects. Due to the increased levels of oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), there is interest in using L-carnitine in CAD ( 95071 ). In clinical research, oral supplementation with L-carnitine for at least 10-12 weeks was associated with lower levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) ( 102125 , 107400 , 107403 , 111899 ). Mechanisms by which L-carnitine could reduce inflammation include reducing lipid peroxidation, increasing antioxidant enzymes, and chelating transition metal ions ( 102125 ). Antiaging effects Carnitine levels are thought to decrease with age and may contribute to age-associated frailty ( 58754 ). Laboratory research suggests that anti-aging benefits of L-carnitine may be associated with its benefits on oxidative damage and changes in heat shock protein expression ( 58159 , 58223 , 58244 , 58536 , 58667 ). In animal aging models, carnitine prevented age-related mitochondrial activity decline ( 58244 , 58383 , 58766 ), possibly by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis ( 58766 ). Anticachexic effects In human research, L-carnitine, alone or in combination with other ingredients, has been shown to have benefit on body weight and body mass index in patients with cachexia ( 23437 , 59012 , 59029 ). Although the exact mechanisms of action are not clear, evidence from animal research suggests that carnitine improves cancer cachexia by regulating the expression and activity of carnitine palmitoyl transferase ( 58961 ) and restoring liver lipid parameters ( 58950 ). Anticancer effects L-carnitine is commonly used by cancer patients. L-carnitine, alone or in combination with butyrate, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro ( 58478 , 58650 ). This anticancer effect may involve reduced prostaglandin E2 production and cyclooxygenase-2 expression, as well as increased expression of pro-apoptotic signaling proteins ( 58650 ) or decreased expression of anti-apoptotic signaling proteins ( 58478 ). Enzymes involved in apoptosis may also be affected by L-carnitine ( 58378 , 58478 ). Antidiabetic effects Carnitine levels are lower in people with complications of diabetes ( 12746 ). Preliminary studies suggest that intravenous infusions of L-carnitine may produce short-term improvements in insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes ( 3651 , 3652 ). Other preliminary clinical research suggests that L-carnitine might also improve glucose utilization, possibly by increasing expression of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes ( 12754 ). A small clinical study in children receiving hemodialysis shows that oral L-carnitine improves fasting blood glucose ( 107400 ). Although evidence is mixed, some evidence from clinical research in patients with diabetes suggests that L-carnitine might improve glycemic control or body weight when used alone or in combination with orlistat or sibutramine ( 58189 , 58778 , 58830 , 58882 , 90632 ). In laboratory models, L-carnitine has been shown to reduce tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, possibly due to increased nitric oxide production ( 58615 ). L-carnitine has also been shown to correct bradycardia associated with compromised glucose availability to the heart ( 58372 ) and normalize skeletal muscle lipids and oxidative stress associated with insulin-resistance ( 58373 ). Potential benefits may be due to protection against protein glycation and enhanced glucose disposal ( 58356 ). Antioxidant effects L-carnitine may have antioxidant properties ( 12352 , 58150 , 58306 , 58843 , 58997 , 95071 , 101566 , 111899 ). L-carnitine has metal-chelating ability, which interferes with the formation of reactive oxygen species and stabilizes the free radicals that are formed ( 95071 ). In human research, L-carnitine has been shown to increase levels of glutathione, decrease levels of malondialdehyde, and increase the activity of superoxide dismutase ( 95071 , 101566 , 107403 , 111899 ). A negative correlation between antioxidant activity and levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein(B) has been seen, suggesting its effects on lipids may be related to its antioxidant effects. Additionally, L-carnitine was negatively correlated with triglycerides and apolipoprotein(B) and positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein(A) ( 95071 ). However, some preliminary research suggests that acetyl-L-carnitine might lessen oxidative stress and prevent oxidative damage in the brain better than L-carnitine ( 12688 ). In laboratory research, the antioxidant effects of carnitine were found to be due to induced expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nitric oxide synthase ( 58201 , 58976 ). In vitro, carnitine reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation ( 58665 ). Atherogenic effects In human population research, the relationship between plasma L-carnitine levels and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and major cardiac events was suggested to be due to the metabolism of L-carnitine to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by the gut microbiota ( 90635 , 95073 ). Evidence from animal research suggests that L-carnitine alters the gut microbial composition, resulting in an increased metabolism of L-carnitine to TMAO, reducing the removal of cholesterol, and increasing atherosclerosis ( 90635 , 95073 ). Increased levels of TMAO have also occurred in humans following L-carnitine supplementation ( 111880 , 111895 ). However, increased risk of cardiovascular disease following oral supplementation of L-carnitine has not been observed in humans. In fact, according to a meta-analysis of clinical trials in humans, L-carnitine supplementation is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality, as well as ventricular arrhythmias and development of angina and does not increase the development of heart failure or myocardial reinfarction ( 59037 ). Also, results from another meta-analysis suggest no effect of L-carnitine on mortality or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with a previous myocardial infarction ( 90630 ). Additionally, laboratory research suggests that L-carnitine appears to inhibit advanced glycation end products (AGE)- modification ( 95073 ). Blood pressure effects L-carnitine may help reduce blood pressure. In animal models of hypertension, L-carnitine has resulted in blood pressure lowering ( 58519 , 58708 , 58796 ), possibly by mechanisms involving the reduction of nitric oxide ( 58422 , 58796 ), inflammatory cytokines ( 58519 ), or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity ( 58519 ). Bone effects L-carnitine may help improve bone density. In animal models, L-carnitine improves bone mineral density by suppressing bone turnover ( 58491 ). In laboratory research, L-carnitine protected against apoptosis of osteoblastic cells ( 58399 ). Potential mechanisms of action include decreased cytochrome c release and caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation. Cardioprotective effects L-carnitine is commonly used to improve heart health. In laboratory research, L-carnitine protects against hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling or related cardiac fibroblast proliferation and inflammation ( 58625 , 58708 ). Myocardial metabolism has also been shown to be improved in animal models of cardiomyopathy ( 58559 , 58891 ). Mechanisms of action appear to be related to signaling pathways involving, antioxidant effects, prostaglandins, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) ( 58253 , 58559 , 58625 , 58708 , 58891 ). Cardiovascular effects A small observational cohort study in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction as well as kidney failure requiring hemodialysis shows that receiving intravenous L-carnitine 1 gram at the end of every hemodialysis session for 12 months is associated with improvements in E/e' ratio, left atrial volume index, and the early diastolic mitral annular velocity when compared with baseline. Improvements in left ventricular diastolic and systolic function were observed only in patients with left ventricular diastolic and systolic dysfunction, respectively, but not in patients with normal ventricular function, at baseline ( 107407 ). Cognitive effects By increasing levels of L-carnitine, the rate of fatty acid oxidation may be increased, leading to a reduction in the use of glucose and maintenance of muscle glycogen, and helping to maximize rates of ATP production ( 95070 ). In the brain, L-carnitine helps to synthesize acetylcholine and acetyl-L-carnitine. Acetyl-L-carnitine can then go through the blood brain barrier and modulate synaptic transmission and increase the release of neurohormones and neurotransmitters ( 95070 ). Dialysis effects Hemodialysis is associated with significant losses of L-carnitine ( 3616 , 3645 ); which may contribute to malaise, muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrhythmias ( 3616 ). L-carnitine supplements, usually given intravenously after dialysis may improve exercise performance, reduce muscle cramps and hypotension, improve erythrocyte survival time, and decrease dose requirements for erythropoietin used to treat anemia ( 3645 , 3646 , 3647 ). Exercise effects Although maximal exercise in trained athletes has been associated with a decrease in plasma L-carnitine levels ( 3648 , 58583 ), restoring these levels with L-carnitine supplementation in clinical studies have reported conflicting results ( 1947 , 58213 , 59128 , 59134 , 59148 , 59182 , 59185 ). Potential mechanisms of action of L-carnitine have been explored. In animal models, L-carnitine has been shown to increase the oxidative capacity of liver and muscle during exercise ( 58840 ) and to promote recovery of muscle fiber thickness ( 58336 ). Also in animal research, carnitine prevented muscle degeneration associated with ovariectomy ( 58957 ). In humans with medication-induced muscle wasting, L-carnitine improves some, but not all, measures of muscle metabolism ( 111897 ). Other benefits of L-carnitine in animal models include an attenuated intermittent hypoxia-induced oxidative stress resulting in delayed muscle fatigue ( 58494 ), and increased time to exhaustion possibly related to antioxidant effects ( 58401 ). Vasodilating properties of L-carnitine were thought to be responsible for decreased pain and tenderness in muscle after an eccentric effort in untrained subjects ( 59148 ). Eye effects The antioxidant effects of L-carnitine may be beneficial in eye health. For example, in experimental glaucoma, L-carnitine reduced the damage to the optic disk associated with lipoperoxides in the cell membrane and resulting cell death ( 58932 ). In an insulin resistance model, L-carnitine protected against oxidation and glycation of the lens ( 58406 ). Fertility effects There is some evidence that L-carnitine has beneficial effects on fertility in humans. Animal models suggest that L-carnitine improves the quality of oocytes and embryos, improves hormone levels, and increases the weight of reproductive organs. This results in increased litter sizes. Laboratory research also suggests that L-carnitine protects oocytes and embryos in culture prior to IVF. The antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects, as well as energy producing effects, of L-carnitine are thought to be at least partially responsible for any fertility benefits. L-carnitine might also indirectly promote fertility by improving hormone release from the hypothalamus ( 96932 ). Gastrointestinal effects L-carnitine may be beneficial for gastrointestinal inflammation associated with inflammatory bowel disorders. In animal colitis models, L-carnitine reduces damage to the colon ( 58214 , 58575 ). Benefits may be associated with the antioxidant effects of L-carnitine ( 58214 ) and/or benefits on inflammatory cytokine levels and T-cell responses ( 58575 ). HIV effects Preliminary studies have reported that daily infusions of L-carnitine may improve CD4 cell counts in people with HIV infection and reduce the percentage of CD4 and CD8 cells undergoing apoptosis. There is some evidence L-carnitine inhibits the enzyme activity of acidic sphingomyelinase and prevents sphingomyelin breakdown in these cells ( 798 , 3632 , 8049 ). Lipid-lowering effects Although preliminary clinical research suggests that L-carnitine does not reduce triglyceride levels in people with hypertriglyceridemia ( 59028 , 59244 ), there is some evidence to suggest beneficial effects on lipoprotein(a) levels ( 58155 , 95073 ) and other lipids ( 59188 , 95073 ) in patients with elevated levels. Also, in animal models, there is some evidence to suggest that L-carnitine may reduce triglycerides and other lipid levels associated with a high-fat diet, possibly by reducing oxidative damage in the liver ( 31463 , 58697 ). L-carnitine might decrease the production of lipoprotein(a) in the liver through increasing the breakdown of fatty acids ( 95073 ). It also might increase transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria, which may lead to decreased availability of fatty acids for lipid synthesis ( 95071 ). Sperm effects L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine are present in human sperm and seminal fluid ( 3607 ). Their levels increase in sperm during the maturation process in the epididymis and coincide with the acquisition of progressive motility ( 3608 , 3609 ). An increase in sperm motility is seen in vitro when L-carnitine or acetyl-L-carnitine is added to the semen sample ( 3612 , 58816 ). In human research, however, benefits on sperm motility are not seen in all studies. However, benefits have been shown for sperm count ( 59020 ). In animal models of oxidative stress impacting sperm count and motility, benefits of L-carnitine may be related to reduced inflammatory cytokines and improved antioxidant effects ( 58266 , 58696 , 58765 ). Thyroid effects In hyperthyroidism, L-carnitine seems to reduce symptoms by blocking entry of thyroid hormone into the nucleus of hepatocytes, neurons, and fibroblasts ( 8047 ). Weight loss effects Although taking L-carnitine alone does not appear to reduce body weight in overweight or obese people ( 58151 , 58775 ), it may have weight loss effects when taken with orlistat or sibutramine ( 58778 , 58830 , 58882 , 95074 ), or in some patients with type 2 diabetes ( 58189 , 95074 , 107393 ). A meta-analysis in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily for at least 2 weeks reduces body mass index by a maximum of 1.5% ( 107393 ). The potential for weight loss effects of L-carnitine may be related to effects on satiety when used alone or in combination with other ingredients ( 59203 , 90629 , 90634 , 90629 ). Taking L-carnitine along with other ingredients does not seem to increase energy expenditure ( 90629 ). In laboratory research, L-carnitine has been shown to influence genes associated with lipolysis or adipogenicity ( 58313 ). Additionally, L-carnitine activates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This leads to a decrease in acetyl-CoA and activation of the glycolytic pathway ( 95074 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Likely Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/L-Carnitine</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Effective L-carnitine deficiency. Oral and intravenous L-carnitine can treat primary and secondary L-carnitine deficiency. Administering L-carnitine orally or intravenously is effective for acute or chronic treatment of primary L-carnitine deficiency or secondary L-carnitine deficiency due to inborn errors of metabolism. This is an FDA-approved indication for L-carnitine ( 4949 , 58611 , 59018 ). For primary or secondary deficiencies, oral L-carnitine 990 mg 2-3 times daily is used. For inborn errors of metabolism resulting in secondary L-carnitine deficiency, L-carnitine 50 mg/kg given as a slow (2-3 minute) bolus injection or by infusion followed by 50 mg/kg administered in divided doses every 3-4 hours over the next 24 hours is also used. Subsequent daily maintenance doses of intravenous L-carnitine are usually around 50 mg/kg ( 3616 ). more Possibly Effective Angina. Oral and intravenous L-carnitine may improve exercise tolerance and symptoms of angina during exercise in patients with angina. Several small clinical trials in patients with chronic stable angina or cardiac syndrome X show that taking L-carnitine orally or intravenously seems to improve exercise tolerance and time to onset of angina when compared with placebo ( 3623 , 3624 , 58156 , 59096 , 59118 , 59216 , 59217 , 59230 ). Oral doses of L-carnitine have ranged from 900 mg to 2 grams daily in single or divided doses for 2 weeks to 6 months ( 3623 , 3624 , 58156 , 59096 , 59118 , 59217 ). Intravenous L-carnitine 3 grams in 500 mL of 5% dextrose, administered once daily for 14 days ( 59230 ), or intravenous DL-carnitine 40 mg/kg administered 30 minutes prior to exercise ( 59216 ) have also been used. more Congestive heart failure (CHF). Oral and intravenous L-carnitine may improve exercise capacity and symptoms of heart failure in patients with CHF. Several small clinical trials in patients with CHF show that taking L-carnitine 1.5-3 grams daily in single or divided doses for up to 34 months or administering intravenous L-carnitine 5 grams daily for 7 days seems to improve symptoms and increase exercise capacity when compared with placebo ( 3625 , 3626 , 58145 , 58771 , 58824 ). Also, taking a specific combination product containing L-carnitine 2250 mg and coenzyme Q10 270 mg (Carni Q-Gel, Tishcon Corporation) daily for 12 weeks appears to improve symptoms of CHF when compared with no treatment ( 58392 ). more Hyperlipidemia. Oral or intravenous L-carnitine may slightly improve lipid levels. Oral, but not intravenous, L-carnitine may also improve lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a). Most meta-analyses of clinical research in patients with or without hyperlipidemia show that L-carnitine, given orally at a dose of 76 mg to 3 grams daily or intravenously at a dose of 15-20 mg/kg three times weekly, appears to reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels by up to 9.5 mg/dL, 8.3 mg/dL, and 11.2 mg/dL, respectively, while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by up to 1.6 mg/dL. Sub-analyses in patients with elevated levels of specific lipids shows that L-carnitine might be most beneficial in these populations ( 95073 , 102019 , 111886 ). However, clinical research is generally very low to moderate quality. Also, any effects of L-carnitine on these lipids are modest and might not be considered clinically significant. An umbrella meta-analysis of meta-analyses of clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine orally reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels by only 1.1 mg/dL, 4.8 mg/dL, and 2.5 mg/dL, with increases in HDL cholesterol of 0.7 mg/dL ( 111896 ). More information is needed on the effects of L-carnitine on lipid levels specifically in patients with hyperlipidemia. Some research has also evaluated the benefits of L-carnitine in people with hyperlipidemia and elevated lipoprotein(a) levels or those undergoing hemodialysis. Preliminary clinical research and a meta-analysis of clinical research in these populations shows that taking L-carnitine 1-2 grams daily for 8-24 weeks reduces levels of lipoprotein(a) by about 9 mg/dL when compared with control ( 58155 , 95073 ). However, giving L-carnitine intravenously 1 gram three times weekly or 4 grams daily does not improve lipoprotein(a) levels in these patients ( 95073 ). Also, oral or intravenous L-carnitine does not improve LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglyceride levels in these patients ( 58155 , 95073 ). Whether L-carnitine reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with hyperlipidemia is unknown. more Kidney failure. Intravenous, but not oral, L-carnitine is FDA-approved for the prevention and treatment of L-carnitine deficiency in patients with kidney failure undergoing hemodialysis. Any other benefits with the use of L-carnitine in patients on hemodialysis are unclear. Patients with kidney failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis often experience L-carnitine deficiency, which can lead to lipid, red blood cell, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle abnormalities ( 26496 ). Use of intravenous L-carnitine for the prevention and treatment of L-carnitine deficiency in people with kidney failure who are undergoing hemodialysis is an FDA-approved indication for L-carnitine. L-carnitine 10-20 mg/kg is given as a slow (2-3 minute) bolus injection, with dose adjustments made based on subsequent pre-dialysis L-carnitine concentrations ( 3616 ). However, oral L-carnitine is not FDA-approved for this purpose. There is concern that long-term administration of high doses of oral L-carnitine may result in accumulation of toxic metabolites, including trimethylamine and trimethylamine-N-oxide, in patients with kidney failure ( 3616 ). Research in other areas are conflicting. Most clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine 0.7-3 grams or 10 mg/kg daily or administering L-carnitine 2-6 grams or 30-60 mg/kg weekly via intravenous infusion can improve cardiac function, intravenous fistula complications, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and C-reactive protein levels in patients on hemodialysis ( 9790 , 26496 , 58257 , 58437 , 58842 , 59009 , 59178 , 111877 ). A meta-analysis of 18 clinical studies in adults with kidney-related anemia undergoing hemodialysis shows that receiving oral or intravenous L-carnitine reduces erythropoietin responsiveness and erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) requirement, but not hemoglobin level, when compared with placebo or conventional therapy, regardless of treatment duration or route of administration ( 107406 ). Despite an earlier meta-analysis suggesting that L-carnitine does not reduce the incidence of dialysis-related hypotension or muscle cramping ( 58511 ), a more recent meta-analysis shows that L-carnitine reduces the incidence of dialysis-related hypotension by 74% when compared with placebo ( 111878 ). However, sub-analyses suggest that only oral L-carnitine, and doses of over 4.2 grams weekly for at least 12 weeks, are effective for preventing hypotension ( 111878 ). A meta-analysis and some preliminary clinical research also show that muscle cramping is reduced by up to 78% when compared with controls ( 104176 , 111878 ). Additionally, observational research has found that administering at least 1 gram of L-carnitine per dialysis session for at least 10 sessions monthly is associated with a 10% to 20% decrease in the number of hospitalization days during the subsequent month ( 58409 ). However, L-carnitine may not be beneficial for improving other measures in people with kidney failure receiving dialysis. While some research shows that L-carnitine decreases lipoprotein(a) levels ( 44187 ), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels ( 26496 , 91723 , 107399 ), and total cholesterol levels ( 107399 ), most research shows that it does not improve serum lipid levels ( 9790 , 26496 , 44187 , 58257 , 58320 , 58842 , 58939 , 59009 , 59025 , 59031 )( 59036 , 59059 , 59080 , 90633 , 91723 , 107399 ). Additionally, while one small clinical trial shows that taking L-carnitine can improve performance on some exercise tests ( 104179 ), most research shows that L-carnitine does not improve respiratory function or exercise performance. The effect on quality of life is unclear ( 58154 , 58437 , 58472 , 58743 , 59031 , 90633 , 111867 , 111877 ). more Male infertility. Oral L-carnitine, taken alone or in combination with acetyl-L-carnitine, may increase sperm motility in males with infertility, leading to a greater likelihood of pregnancy in female partners. Although some clinical research has yielded conflicting results ( 58209 , 58588 , 59020 , 90627 , 111861 ), most clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine 1-3 grams daily in divided doses for up to 24 weeks, with or without acetyl-L-carnitine 1 gram daily, increases sperm count and motility, and improves sperm morphology, in males with infertility of various etiologies ( 12352 , 58167 , 58182 , 58194 , 58334 , 58469 , 58831 , 58849 , 59129 , 59189 )( 59190 , 101560 , 107394 , 111861 , 111459 , 111888 , 111890 ). However, it is unclear if taking L-carnitine increases the odds of pregnancy. One meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials shows that taking L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine in combination increases the odds of pregnancy by 3.7-fold over placebo. However most clinical research investigating the effect of L-carnitine alone or with acetyl L-carnitine on pregnancy rates disagrees ( 12352 , 58182 , 101560 , 111861 , 111459 , 111888 ). The number of studies investigating the effect of L-carnitine alone or with acetyl-L-carnitine on pregnancy rate is small and the duration of supplementation may be inadequate. Taking L-carnitine 1 gram and acetyl-L-carnitine 0.5 grams twice daily after taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 2 months seems to increase sperm count and motility in males with abacterial prostatovesiculoepididymitis, an inflammation of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and epididymis ( 9791 ). Some studies have also evaluated L-carnitine in combination with other ingredients. One clinical trial in males with asthenospermia shows that taking L-carnitine 150 mg, acetyl-L-carnitine 50 mg, L-arginine 1660 mg, and Panax ginseng 200 mg daily for 3 months increases sperm motility and sexual satisfaction when compared with no treatment ( 32189 ). Another small clinical trial shows that taking this combination along with prulifloxacin 600 mg daily for 6 months improves sperm concentration and motility when compared with prulifloxacin alone in patients with chronic prostatitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis infection ( 59006 ). Other small and preliminary clinical studies have investigated the effects of a specific combination product providing L-carnitine 1 gram twice daily for 6 months, along with acetyl-L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, selenium, zinc, vitamin C, folic acid, vitamin B12, and citric acid (Proxeed Plus). Taking this combination product has been shown to improve measures of sperm quality such as sperm count, sperm concentration, total motility, and progressive motility when compared to baseline. The effect on sperm volume and morphology is unclear. Most research has been conducted in patients with oligoasthenozoospermia, although some benefit has also been shown in patients with varicocele-related infertility, especially those with more severe varicocele ( 102017 , 107395 , 111296 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of comparator group. Also, it is unclear if these effects are due to L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination. The effect of L-carnitine in combination with other ingredients on pregnancy rate has also been examined. One meta-analysis of moderate-quality clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine in combination with micronutrients increases the odds of pregnancy by 3.5-fold over placebo or no treatment ( 111888 ). more Myocarditis. Oral DL-carnitine may prevent myocarditis in children with diphtheria. Myocarditis is a complication of diphtheria. Clinical research in children with diphtheria shows that taking DL-carnitine 100 mg/kg daily for 4 days reduces the risk of myocarditis and mortality when compared with no treatment ( 3620 , 3621 ). more Valproic acid-induced toxicities. Although more well-designed research is needed to confirm these findings, oral and intravenous L-carnitine may improve neurologic and hepatic function and reduce ammonia levels in patients with these valproic acid-induced toxicities. Valproic acid-induced toxicities are often associated with low plasma and tissue levels of L-carnitine. Preliminary clinical research and case reports in patients on valproic acid therapy who have neurologic or hepatic deterioration or hyperammonemia show that taking L-carnitine 50-100 mg/kg daily in divided doses or administering L-carnitine 150-500 mg/kg daily via intravenous infusion seems to improve neurologic and hepatic function and bring plasma ammonia levels within normal limits ( 1438 , 1914 , 1915 , 1916 , 1917 , 4523 , 5798 , 5799 , 95068 ). There is also some preliminary evidence that intravenous L-carnitine can prevent the development of severe valproic acid-induced hepatotoxicity when given to patients being treated for overdose and accidental ingestion of valproic acid ( 1438 , 4528 , 5798 , 5799 ), especially if treatment is initiated early ( 4528 ). Despite these results, most evidence consists of anecdotal individuals or small case series. A more recent retrospective cohort study suggests that treatment with an L-carnitine dosing regimen consisting of a 100 mg/kg intravenous loading dose followed by up to 3 grams daily in divided doses for 3 days or until ICU discharge does not enhance valproic acid elimination or prevent organ dysfunction when compared with patients not treated with L-carnitine ( 111869 ). Also, taking L-carnitine does not appear to reduce valproic acid-associated weight gain ( 58295 ). Well-designed clinical trials are still needed to determine the role of L-carnitine in the treatment or prevention of valproic acid toxicities. more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acne. Topical L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. One small clinical trial in patients with mild-to-moderate acne shows that applying a proprietary formulation containing L-carnitine, licochalcone, and 1,2-decanediol to the face twice daily for 8 weeks reduces the number of acne lesions and pustules and improves quality of life when compared to baseline. However, the improvements do not appear to be significant when compared with placebo ( 26493 ). more Age-related fatigue. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may improve physical and mental fatigue associated with aging. Two small clinical trials in elderly patients experiencing fatigue after slight physical activity shows that taking L-carnitine 2-4 grams daily for 1-6 months improves physical and mental fatigue, increases muscle mass, and decreases fat mass when compared with placebo ( 16109 , 16111 ). more Aluminum phosphide poisoning. It is unclear if intravenous L-carnitine is beneficial in people with aluminum phosphide poisoning. A meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research in patients with aluminum phosphide poisoning shows that intravenous L-carnitine does not reduce the odds of mortality when compared with control groups receiving routine treatments only ( 111892 ). However, only 2 studies were included in the analysis and both studies may have been underpowered to detect differences. more Alzheimer disease. Oral L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking L-carnitine tartrate 3.73 grams, in combination with serine, nicotinamide riboside, and N-acetyl cysteine, daily for 28 days and then twice daily for 56 days does not improve cognitive function when compared with taking placebo. However, in patients with the most severe symptoms, there was some modest improvement ( 110623 ). This study may have been underpowered to detect differences. Also, the effect of L-carnitine alone is unclear. more Androgenic alopecia. It is unclear if topical L-carnitine is beneficial in people with androgenic alopecia. One small clinical trial in individuals with androgenic alopecia shows that applying topical L-carnitine 2% solution to the scalp twice daily for 6 months significantly increases the number of terminal hair shafts on the scalp when compared with placebo ( 58390 ). more Anorexia nervosa. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for anorexia nervosa, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose. Anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Oral and intravenous L-carnitine have only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical trial in patients with breast cancer undergoing doxorubicin treatment shows that taking a combination of L-carnitine and vitamin E over 4 21-day treatment cycles decreases the proportion of patients with cardiac events by 24.2% when compared with chemotherapy treatment only. There were also modest beneficial effects on some enzyme measures of cardiac health. Patients received L-carnitine 3 grams intravenously on the first day of each cycle followed by an oral intake of 300 mg 4 times daily for the remaining 20 days. Vitamin E 1800 mg daily was taken orally in 3 divided doses ( 111891 ). more Arrhythmia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may reduce the incidence of arrhythmias in patients with premature ventricular contractions. Small clinical trials in patients with premature ventricular contractions show that taking L-carnitine 2 grams twice daily for 45 weeks or 2 grams three times daily for 2 weeks might reduce the incidence of arrhythmias when compared to baseline ( 59043 , 59120 , 59143 ). more Asthenopia (eye strain). Oral L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in videoterminal users with computer vision syndrome and without dry eye shows that taking a product containing L-carnitine 50 mg, along with zinc and extracts of elderberry, black currant, and eleuthero root (Meramirt CM) daily for 1 month modestly reduces severity of eye strain and sensitivity when compared with not taking this product ( 111295 ). It is unclear if these findings are due to L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Athletic performance. Oral L-carnitine has been evaluated for its effect on athletic performance in several small and short-term clinical studies, with mixed results. Maximal exercise in trained athletes has been associated with a decrease in plasma L-carnitine levels ( 3648 , 58583 ). Theoretically, restoring these levels with L-carnitine supplementation might have beneficial effects. However, clinical studies examining the use of L-carnitine for athletic performance have reported conflicting results. Some clinical studies show that taking L-carnitine 2 grams, either before exercise or daily for up to 6 weeks, enhances athletic performance and endurance and reduces post-exercise muscle pain in male athletes and healthy untrained males ( 58450 , 59182 , 59185 ), but other studies do not support these findings ( 1947 , 59128 , 59134 ). Additionally, although some studies show that taking L-carnitine 1-2 grams or 40 mg/kg before exercise or 4 grams daily for 2 weeks can decrease lactate accumulation and increase oxygen uptake, power output, and time to anabolic threshold during exercise ( 3649 , 3650 , 59061 , 59184 , 59186 ), other studies show no improvement in these outcomes ( 58471 , 58775 , 59033 , 59045 , 59069 , 59128 ). These discrepancies may be related to the small study sizes, short treatment durations, and variable dosing regimens. more Atrial fibrillation. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing aortic valve surgery. A very small clinical study in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement or valve-sparing aortic root replacement shows that receiving oral L-carnitine (L-Cartin FF, Otsuka Pharmaceutical) 1 gram three times daily, beginning 2 days prior to surgery and continuing for 7 days after surgery, is associated with a postoperative atrial fibrillation rate of 20%, compared with a rate of 60% in a historical age-matched control group not receiving L-carnitine ( 107408 ). more Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in children with ADHD. One small crossover trial in children with ADHD shows that taking L-carnitine 50 mg/kg twice daily for 6 months improves parent and teacher assessments of behavior when compared with placebo ( 58166 ). more Autism spectrum disorder. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may improve some symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Small clinical trials in children 3-16 years of age with autism spectrum disorder show that taking L-carnitine 50 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg daily for 8 to 12 weeks modestly improves overall symptoms of autism, especially lethargy, social isolation, hyperactivity, and irritability, when compared with taking placebo. However, there is inconsistency between studies with respect to rating scales used and specific endpoints showing improvement. In one study, children remained on any pre-existing medications; in the other two, all children were also taking risperidone ( 58981 , 111887 , 111900 ). more Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oral L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical trial in patients in Iran with BPH shows that taking L-carnitine 1000 mg plus coenzyme Q10 daily in addition to finasteride 5 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly improves subjective assessment of sexual function when compared with placebo plus finasteride. There was no effect on prostate symptoms, prostate specific antigen levels, or quality of life ( 113226 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, or the combination. more Beta-thalassemia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may improve symptoms and reduce complications of beta-thalassemia minor, intermedia, and major. Several small clinical trials in children with beta-thalassemia major show that taking L-carnitine 50 mg/kg daily for 3-6 months might reduce pulmonary artery systolic pressure, increase cardiac output during exercise, and improve progression to puberty ( 58294 , 58502 , 58556 ). Clinical research in adults with beta-thalassemia intermedia shows that taking L-carnitine with hydroxyurea appears to increase hemoglobin and hematocrit and reduce left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, a measure of pulmonary hypertension ( 58679 ). In patients with beta-thalassemia major or intermedia aged 6 years and up, taking L-carnitine 50 mg/kg daily for 6 months normalized left ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy in 30% and 37% of patients, respectively, compared with only 10% in those taking placebo. Cardiac output was also improved, but there were no changes in blood parameters ( 101565 ). Clinical research in children with beta-thalassemia minor shows that taking L-carnitine 50 mg/kg daily, with or without folic acid 1 mg daily, for 3 months appears to reduce bone pain by 84% to 87% and increase the number of climbable stairs 3.1- to 5.2-fold when compared with baseline ( 90631 ). more Cachexia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may improve body composition and quality of life in patients with cancer-related cachexia. One small clinical trial in patients with cancer-related cachexia shows that taking L-carnitine 4 grams daily for 12 weeks increases body mass index (BMI) when compared with placebo ( 59029 ). Other research shows that taking L-carnitine 4 grams daily with megestrol acetate, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and thalidomide for 5 months is more effective than any single product alone for increasing lean body mass in patients with cancer-related cachexia ( 23437 ). Additionally, taking L-carnitine 4 grams daily with megestrol acetate, celecoxib, and antioxidants for 4 months appears more effective than megestrol acetate alone for improving lean body mass, fatigue, and quality of life in these patients ( 59012 ). more Cancer-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for improving fatigue in patients with advanced cancer. Some cancer patients have low blood levels of L-carnitine, which may reduce energy production and lead to fatigue. Some small clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer show that taking L-carnitine 3-4 grams daily for 7 days significantly improves some measures of fatigue when compared to baseline ( 16106 , 16110 ). However, other higher quality clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine 2-4 grams daily for 4-12 weeks is no more effective than placebo for improving fatigue in advanced cancer patients ( 26498 , 58523 , 59029 ). more Celiac disease. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with celiac disease. Some research shows that L-carnitine blood levels are low in patients with celiac disease. One small clinical trial in patients with celiac disease shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 6 months lowers some measures of fatigue when compared with placebo. However, L-carnitine does not significantly improve measures of depression or quality of life in these patients ( 16105 ). more Chemotherapy-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with fatigue due to sunitinib therapy. A small clinical study in adults with renal cell carcinoma who are experiencing fatigue associated with sunitinib treatment shows that taking L-carnitine 1500 mg daily for 2 weeks modestly improves fatigue severity when compared to baseline ( 100352 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the small study size and lack of a comparator group. more Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with CFS. One small clinical study in adults with CFS shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram three times daily for 2 months can improve some symptoms of CFS when compared to baseline ( 3630 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with COPD. One small clinical study in adults with moderate to severe COPD shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 6 weeks improves exercise performance and walking tolerance when compared with placebo ( 58213 ). more Cirrhosis. Preliminary research suggests that oral L-carnitine may be beneficial in patients with cirrhosis. One small clinical trial in patients with cirrhosis who are receiving branched-chain amino acids supplements to improve nutritional status shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram orally daily for 6 months, in addition to increasing exercise by 2000 steps per day, does not improve muscle volume, handgrip strength, or leg strength, but does reduce complaints of muscle cramping, when compared to baseline ( 102124 ). Another small, uncontrolled clinical trial in patients with cirrhosis shows that taking L-carnitine 1800 mg daily for 6 months does not improve Child-Pugh scores, but may improve quality of life, when compared to baseline ( 104177 ). The validity of these studies is limited by the lack of comparator groups. The effect of L-carnitine has also been examined retrospectively in patients with cirrhosis. One retrospective study in matched patients that had been admitted to hospital for cirrhosis suggests that taking L-carnitine for more than 30 days is associated with an increase in survival length by about 21 months compared with not taking L-carnitine. Overall, L-carnitine use was also associated with a 36% to 48% increase in the proportion of patients surviving 1-5 years, with the greatest effect in patients with modest to severe liver dysfunction. The median dose of L-carnitine was 1000 mg daily for at least 6 months is associated with a reduced loss of skeletal muscle compared with not taking L-carnitine ( 111860 ). The validity of these studies is limited by their retrospective design. more Cognitive function. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for improving cognitive function in healthy individuals. Low-quality clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine 500 mg as a single dose or 250 mg twice daily for 3 days does not improve cognitive function or memory in otherwise healthy young adults when compared with placebo ( 58176 , 95070 ). more Coronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with CHD. One small clinical trial in patients with CHD shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams prior to exercise does not improve endurance when compared with placebo ( 58196 ). Another small clinical trial in patients with CHD shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram daily for 12 weeks does not improve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, or apolipoprotein-B when compared with placebo; however, it does appear to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein A-1 levels in these patients ( 95071 ). more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for COVID-19 prevention or treatment. Preliminary clinical research in patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram 3 times daily for 5 days does not reduce the incidence of fever or cough when compared with standard treatments only. However, all patients taking L-carnitine survived compared with 86% of those given standard treatment only. Also, there were improvements in oxygen saturation and inflammatory measures ( 111874 ). Other clinical research in patients with confirmed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 shows that taking L-carnitine tartrate (Carnipure) 1 gram 3 times daily for 21 days does not prevent the development of severe lung symptoms when compared with taking placebo. However, in a sub-group of patients, lung lesion improvement was significantly better between days 7 and 14. In adults without COVID-19 but living with someone with confirmed disease, taking this product does not prevent COVID-19 when compared with taking placebo. However, the total number of confirmed illnesses in the population was low ( 111898 ). more Critical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral or nasogastric L-carnitine is beneficial for critical illness. One small clinical trial in critically ill patients in the ICU shows that receiving L-carnitine (BSK, Zist Takhmir Co, Tehran-Iran) 3 grams daily via a nasogastric tube for 7 days modestly improves disease severity, organ function, inflammatory and other laboratory measures when compared with receiving placebo. Also, mortality rate was reduced by approximately 50%. There was no effect on the duration of hospital or ICU stay ( 111883 , 111884 ). However, another small clinical trial in critically ill patients following an acute ischemic stroke shows that oral or nasogastric L-carnitine tartrate 500 mg every 8 hours for 6 days does not affect the duration of mechanical ventilation or hospital or ICU stay, the severity of illness, or 28-day mortality rates, when compared with taking placebo. There was a modest beneficial effect on insulin resistance ( 111881 ). This study was small and may have been underpowered to detect differences. more Diabetes. Oral L-carnitine may improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes, but it is unclear if these improvements are clinically meaningful. It is also unclear if L-carnitine can improve lipid profiles or weight loss in these patients. While individual study results are mixed ( 58169 , 58189 , 58514 , 58793 , 90632 , 96922 , 101561 ), meta-analyses of available clinical research in mixed populations shows that taking L-carnitine 200 mg to 4 grams daily reduces fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels, and possibly insulin, and improves insulin resistance, when compared with taking placebo or a control diet, although the clinical significance of these improvements is unclear ( 102018 , 111875 , 111886 ). One meta-analysis shows that these benefits are generally specific to patients with high levels of fasting glucose, diabetes, or obesity, as well as studies investigating L-carnitine in doses of at least 2 grams daily for 12 weeks. However, a small number of studies included in this analysis investigated the effects of acetyl-L-carnitine ( 111875 ). Other research in obese patients with type 2 diabetes shows that, when taken with orlistat or sibutramine, L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 12 months decreases body weight and body mass index and improves glycemic control when compared with orlistat or sibutramine alone ( 58778 , 58830 , 58882 ). The effect of L-carnitine on lipids in people with diabetes is unclear. Some studies show significant reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and/or lipoprotein(a) ( 58554 , 58647 , 58649 , 90632 , 101561 , 107397 ), while other studies show no improvement in lipid profiles ( 58169 , 58189 ). more Dilated cardiomyopathy. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may improve ejection fraction in children with dilated cardiomyopathy and adults with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Primary L-carnitine deficiency is a common cause of pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy. Additionally, patients with dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology have been shown to have low cardiac levels of L-carnitine ( 59196 , 100351 ). Due to these findings, L-carnitine has been evaluated for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy in children and adults, but the small sizes of these studies and methodological limitations limit the reliability of the results. One small clinical study in children under 13 years of age with dilated cardiomyopathy shows that taking L-carnitine 50-100 mg/kg daily for 1 year in conjunction with standard care improves ejection fraction and reduces left atrial and ventricular diameters when compared with placebo and standard care ( 100351 ). The results of this study are limited by the small sample size, unclear etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy, and potential bias. Another small clinical study in children under 5 years of age with dilated cardiomyopathy and low serum levels of L-carnitine shows that taking L-carnitine 100 mg/kg daily for 3 months improves left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification when compared with baseline ( 59196 ). Further research is needed to clarify whether L-carnitine is beneficial for most children with dilated cardiomyopathy, or only those with carnitine deficiency. L-carnitine has also been evaluated in older adults. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in mostly older adults with dilated cardiomyopathy shows that addition of intravenous L-carnitine, alone or followed by oral L-carnitine, 1-6 grams daily to conventional therapy for a total of 10-28 days is associated with a 28% increased likelihood of overall efficacy, with improvements observed in both LVEF and cardiac output, when compared with conventional therapy alone ( 107405 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, potential publication bias, and unclear reporting. A small individual clinical study in older adults with ischemic cardiomyopathy shows that taking oral L-carnitine daily for 2 months improves LVEF when compared with baseline ( 58150 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Dry eye. Topical L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Evidence suggests that chronic use of eye drops containing benzalkonium chloride can cause tear film instability and lead to dry eye ( 90921 ). One small clinical trial in patients with glaucoma using eye drops containing benzalkonium chloride shows that using additional eye drops containing L-carnitine (1.017%), eledoisin (0.04%), taurine (0.49%), sodium hyaluronate (0.20 grams/100 mL), and vitamin E acetate (0.20 grams/100 mL) (Carnidrop Plus, Sigma-Tau) three times daily for 15 days reduces dry eye symptoms by approximately 50% when compared to baseline ( 90625 ). It is unclear if these findings are due to L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Endometriosis. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for endometriosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose. Erectile dysfunction (ED). Oral L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A moderate-sized, open-label clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate ED shows that taking a specific combination supplement (Icarifil, Anvest Health S.p.A) containing L-carnitine 500 mg, L-citrulline, Panax ginseng, tribulus, and other ingredients daily for 3 months improves patient-reported erectile function when compared to baseline. Additionally, taking the supplement with tadalafil improves some, but not all, patient-reported assessments of erectile function when compared with taking tadalafil alone ( 114989 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the interpretation of these results is limited by poor methodology, including the use of per-protocol analysis and lack of a placebo group. more Exercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine tartrate is beneficial for exercise recovery. A small clinical study in healthy males and females participating in moderate physical activity at least 3 days weekly shows that taking a specific product (Carnipure, Lonza Consumer Health, Inc.) providing elemental L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 5 weeks improves perceived recovery and soreness as well as serum creatine kinase levels by 33% and 28%, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 107398 ). more Exercise-induced muscle soreness. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may slightly reduce exercise-induced muscle soreness. Evidence from mostly small clinical trials, when considered alone or combined via meta-analysis, shows that taking L-carnitine 1-3 grams daily for around 3 weeks modestly reduces exercise-induced muscle soreness, especially in the period of 24-48 hours after exercise. Benefits may last up to 96 hours post-exercise. Levels of creatinine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and myoglobin also appear to improve with L-carnitine supplementation, reflecting a reduction in muscle damage ( 58326 , 58709 , 59148 , 101567 ). more Hepatic encephalopathy. Oral or intravenous L-carnitine may improve biochemical markers of disease severity in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, but L-carnitine does not seem to improve clinically important outcomes such as fatigue, quality of life, or overall disease severity. A meta-analysis of nine studies in adults with hepatic encephalopathy shows that taking L-carnitine 1-6 grams daily orally or intravenously for up to 90 days increases albumin levels and decreases plasma levels of ammonia, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine, but does not improve fatigue or quality of life, when compared with placebo ( 102122 ). A more recent clinical trial shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 24 weeks modestly improves bilirubin levels and some measures of cognitive and liver health, but not quality of life, when compared with taking placebo ( 111876 ). Two of the clinical trials included in this analysis also show that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 60-90 days significantly improves cognitive function when compared with placebo in adults with hepatic encephalopathy ( 58174 , 58204 ). Another small clinical trial in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis shows that L-carnitine improves psychometric response to the ammonia tolerance test, suggesting that L-carnitine might be useful in the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy ( 58872 ). L-carnitine has also been evaluated in combination with rifaximin. A small clinical study in patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy shows that taking oral L-carnitine 1500 mg in combination with rifaximin 1200 mg three times daily for 12 weeks has no effect on the modified portal systemic encephalopathy index when compared with rifaximin alone. L-carnitine improved blood ammonia levels at 4 weeks, but not at 8 or 12 weeks ( 107410 ). more Hepatitis B. Oral L-carnitine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in patients with hepatitis B shows that taking a specific vitamin complex providing L-carnitine 2472 mg (Godex, Celltrion Pharm) in combination with entecavir 0.5 grams daily for 12 months normalizes alanine transaminase (ALT) levels in 95% and 100% of patients after 3 months and 12 months, respectively, compared to 59% and 86% of patients taking entecavir alone. However, the L-carnitine complex does not appear to improve aspartate transaminase (AST) levels or reduce hepatitis B virus titers ( 91724 ). It is unclear if these findings are due to L-carnitine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Hepatitis C. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may improve response to treatment and markers of liver function in patients with hepatitis C. Two small clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis C show that taking L-carnitine 2 grams once or twice daily along with interferon-alpha and ribavirin for 12 months modestly improves response to treatment, increases hemoglobin and red blood cell counts, reduces aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and reduces steatosis when compared with interferon-alpha and ribavirin treatment alone ( 58405 , 59010 ). more Hepatitis-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with hepatitis-related fatigue. One small clinical trial in patients with hepatitis C who are receiving interferon-alpha treatment shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily significantly reduces fatigue when compared with interferon-alpha alone. L-carnitine appears to reduce fatigue within the first 3 months of treatment, but not after 6 months ( 16104 ). more HIV/AIDS. Although there has been interest in using intravenous L-carnitine to increase CD4 counts in patients with HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose. Hypertension. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for reducing systolic or diastolic blood pressure. A meta-analysis of low-quality clinical studies in adults, both healthy and with underlying health conditions,shows that taking oral L-carnitine 0.5 to 3 grams daily for 4 to 52 weeks does not reduce systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when compared with control( 115352 ). The validity of this study is limited by heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including population, dose, and outcome measurements. more Hyperthyroidism. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with hyperthyroidism. One small clinical trial in females with hyperthyroidism shows that taking L-carnitine 2-4 grams daily for 2-6 months seems to significantly improve symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, nervousness, tremors, and asthenia, when compared with placebo ( 8047 ). more Hypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Small clinical studies in patients with hypertriglyceridemia show that taking L-carnitine 1 gram daily for 12 weeks does not reduce triglyceride levels when compared with placebo ( 59028 , 59244 ). more Hypothyroidism. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for improving fatigue in patients with hypothyroidism. One small clinical trial in patients with secondary hypothyroidism shows that taking L-carnitine (Ildong Pharmaceutical Co.) 990 mg twice daily for 12 weeks in addition to adequate doses of levothyroxine does not reduce overall fatigue severity when compared with placebo. However, taking L-carnitine might improve physical and mental fatigue in patients with secondary hypothyroidism that are less than 50 years of age. L-carnitine might also improve mental fatigue in patients that underwent thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer ( 95069 ). more Infertility. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for female infertility. One uncontrolled clinical trial in females who had failed to conceive in previous in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles shows that taking L-carnitine (L-CAR Basic Premium; AA Project Co. ltd.) 1000 mg daily for an average of 82 days does not improve the number of retrieved oocytes or fertilization rates when compared with previous IVF cycles. However, embryo quality at days 3 and 5 of insemination was improved, resulting in an increase in the rate of transferable embryos from 60% in previous cycles to 67%, morphologically good-quality embryos from around 46% to 54%, and blastocysts from around 11% to 21%. The most evidence of benefit was seen in those taking L-carnitine for the shortest time length of 7-44 days ( 96933 ). more Intermittent claudication. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for intermittent claudication, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose. Liver disease. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-carnitine may modestly improve some, but not all, lipid parameters in adults with liver disease. A meta-analysis of six small, low-quality clinical trials in patients with hepatitis C, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) shows that taking L-carnitine moderately reduces total cholesterol and slightly reduces triglyceride levels, but does not improve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with control. Studies evaluating L-carnitine doses of 2 grams daily or less and study durations of 24 months or longer showed the largest effect on lipid levels ( 104178 ). Another meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research in patients with hepatitis B or C, hepatic encephalopathy, NASH, or NAFLD shows that taking L-carnitine modestly reduces levels if aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (AST) when compared with taking placebo or no L-carnitine. Some of the studies included in this analysis used acetyl-L-carnitine. However, a meta-analysis of two studies investigating the effect of carnitine orotate shows that taking this compound increases the proportion of patients with normal ALT levels by 4.6 fold ( 111871 ). more Liver transplant. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients awaiting a liver transplant. One small clinical trial shows that taking L-carnitine 500 mg three times daily while awaiting a liver transplant does not reduce the incidence of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) or non-function (PNF) when compared with placebo. However, survival one month after surgery was 97% in those taking L-carnitine, compared with 74% in those taking placebo ( 101562 ). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in the incidences of PGD and PNF between groups. more Low birth weight. It is unclear if oral or intravenous L-carnitine is effective for increasing body weight in preterm infants. Several small clinical studies show conflicting results. Several very small clinical trials in preterm infants receiving total parenteral nutrition show that administering L-carnitine orally at a dose of 13-60 mcmol/kg or intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg or 50-100 mcmol/kg daily can improve fat utilization and weight gain when compared with control ( 3633 , 3634 , 3635 , 3636 , 3637 , 58902 , 59097 ). However, other small clinical studies show that supplementation with L-carnitine does not significantly increase body weight in preterm infants ( 58190 , 58800 , 59161 ). The reasons for the discrepant findings are unclear, but due to small study size, some of the studies may have been underpowered to detect significant differences between groups. more Lyme disease. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose. Malnutrition. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in children with severe malnutrition. A moderate-sized clinical study conducted in Bangladesh in children aged 9 to 24 months hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition shows that administering oral L-carnitine syrup 100 mg/kg daily for 15 days in addition to standard care does not improve rates of weight gain or reduce durations of hospital stays when compared with placebo ( 115351 ). more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral or intravenous L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome. One very small clinical trial in patients with metabolic syndrome undergoing 2 days of moderate calorie restriction followed by a 5-day modified fasting period shows that intravenous L-carnitine 2 grams twice daily for 7 days increases weight loss by 1.4 kg and decreases waist circumference by 3.3 cm when compared with intravenous saline. Perceived hunger scores, physical fatigue, and insulin levels were also improved. However, there were no effects on blood pressure ( 90634 ). Other clinical research in patients with metabolic syndrome and a total carotid plaque volume of at least 50 mm 3 shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily for 6 months does not affect the progression of carotid plaque volume when compared with taking placebo. Also, taking L-carnitine increased the progression of carotid plaque stenosis by 9.3%, as well as levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, in this population ( 111879 ). more Migraine headache. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with migraine headaches. One small clinical trial in patients with migraines shows that taking L-carnitine 500 mg daily, with or without magnesium oxide, for 12 weeks does not significantly reduce migraine frequency or severity when compared with a control ( 59030 ). However, another small preliminary clinical trial in children with episodic migraines shows that taking L-carnitine 25 mg per kg twice daily for 12 weeks prophylactically is as effective as taking propranolol 1 mg/kg once daily for reducing the frequency, severity, and duration of migraine headaches ( 111870 ). These studies were small and may have been underpowered to detect differences between groups. more Multiple sclerosis-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with multiple sclerosis-related fatigue. Some patients with multiple sclerosis have low blood levels of L-carnitine. Additionally, immunosuppressive therapy for multiple sclerosis can cause fatigue. One small, open-label clinical trial in patients with multiple sclerosis receiving immunosuppressive therapy and with low L-carnitine levels shows that taking L-carnitine 3-6 grams daily decreases some measures of fatigue when compared with no treatment ( 16107 ). more Muscle cramps. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with muscle cramps. One small, uncontrolled clinical trial in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking L-carnitine 300 mg twice daily for 4 months decreases the monthly frequency of muscle cramps from around 4 cramps per month at baseline to around 1 cramp per month after treatment. When compared with baseline, pain was also reduced by about 1 point on a 5-point scale ( 96922 ). However, the lack of a placebo control group limits the validity of these findings. more Myocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if oral or intravenous L-carnitine is beneficial in patients who have experienced an MI. Some clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine orally or intravenously after MI reduces premature ventricular beats ( 58172 , 59044 ), improves myocardial viability ( 59248 ) and left ventricular function ( 3628 ), and reduces mortality ( 3627 , 3629 , 59037 ). However, other studies show no change in left ventricular functioning ( 58148 ) or mortality after taking L-carnitine ( 3628 , 58225 , 90630 ). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear, but may be due to differences in the dosing regimens and length of follow-up. Oral L-carnitine doses have ranged from 2-4 grams daily for up to 12 months ( 3627 , 3629 , 59248 ). Intravenous L-carnitine has been dosed at 5 grams within the first 36 hours after an MI followed by 3 grams twice daily on days 3-7 ( 58172 ), 100 mg/kg every 12 hours for 36 hours ( 59044 ), or 9 grams daily for 5 days followed by oral L-carnitine 6 grams daily for 12 months ( 3628 ). more Narcolepsy. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with narcolepsy. One small clinical trial in patients with narcolepsy shows that taking L-carnitine 340 mg in the morning and 170 mg in the evening for 8 weeks reduces dozing off time during the day by about 9 minutes when compared with placebo. However, the number of naps needed, quality of life, and sleepiness are not affected ( 90624 ). more Neonatal apnea. It is unclear if intravenous L-carnitine is beneficial for preventing neonatal apnea in premature infants. One small clinical trial in premature infants shows that adding L-carnitine 30 mg/kg daily to total parenteral nutrition or oral feeds does not affect ventilator requirements or reduce the incidence of apnea when compared with placebo ( 58163 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in children and adults with NAFLD. One small clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking L-carnitine 600 mg daily for 3 months improves markers of liver function when compared with baseline. No improvements in liver function markers were reported in patients in the control group; however, no statistical comparisons were conducted between groups ( 58808 ). A small clinical study in children aged 5-15 years with NAFLD receiving vitamin E shows that taking L-carnitine 25 mg/kg twice daily (maximum of 500 mg twice daily) for 3 months has no effect on aminotransferase concentrations or sonographic grades of fatty liver when compared with placebo ( 107401 ). more Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with NASH. One small clinical trial in patients with NASH shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram after breakfast and 1 gram after dinner daily along with following a specific diet improves markers of liver function when compared with diet alone ( 58715 ). Another small clinical trial in patients with obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis taking simvastatin 20 mg daily and following a hypocaloric diet shows that taking L-carnitine 10 mL twice daily for 90 days modestly reduces BMI, and improves liver health, lipid, and glycemic indices, when compared with taking a product described as essential phospholipids ( 111893 ). more Obesity. Oral L-carnitine seems to have a small effect on weight loss in overweight or obese individuals when taken for up to 6 months, but some conflicting results exist. Doses of 2 grams daily seem to offer the most benefit. Meta-analyses of clinical trials show that taking L-carnitine 250 mg to 4 grams daily reduces weight and body mass index (BMI) by a small amount when compared with a control group not taking L-carnitine ( 95074 , 101563 , 101564 ). Subgroup analyses show that L-carnitine only reduces BMI and weight in overweight or obese patients. Taking L-carnitine did not affect weight or BMI in patients with a BMI of up to 25 kg/m2 or in patients undergoing hemodialysis ( 101563 , 101564 ). Another subgroup analysis shows that the largest benefit occurs at a dose of 2 grams daily ( 101564 ). In patients with obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis taking simvastatin 20 mg daily and following a hypocaloric diet, one clinical trial shows that taking L-carnitine 10 mL twice daily for 90 days modestly reduces BMI, and improves liver health, lipid, and glycemic indices, when compared with taking a product described as essential phospholipids ( 111893 ). However, conflicting results exist. One subgroup analysis in overweight or obese individuals shows that there is no effect on BMI when L-carnitine is taken for 24 weeks or more ( 101563 ). One meta-analysis of two small clinical trials in patients with overweight or obesity shows that taking L-carnitine is no more effective than lifestyle modification for reducing body weight ( 111866 ). Also, some clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine does not reduce body weight in obese females. Doses used in these studies include L-carnitine 1 gram daily for 12 weeks or 2 grams twice daily for 8 weeks along with exercise ( 58151 , 111872 ). The effect of L-carnitine on cardiovascular risk has also been examined in patients with obesity. One small clinical trial shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces the lipid accumulation index, based on waist circumference and blood triglyceride levels, when compared with taking placebo. However, there was no effect on other cardiovascular risk indices based on ratios of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and/or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels ( 111872 ). L-carnitine has also been evaluated in combination with weight loss medications. Clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams daily along with orlistat 360 mg daily or sibutramine 10 mg daily for 1 year decreases body weight and BMI when compared with orlistat or sibutramine alone in obese adults with type 2 diabetes ( 58778 , 58830 , 58882 ). more Osteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with knee osteoarthritis. A small clinical study in females with knee osteoarthritis and overweight or obesity who are on a low-calorie diet shows that taking L-carnitine 1 gram daily for 12 weeks does not improve pain, stiffness, or physical function when compared with placebo ( 107403 ). more Pemphigus. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for glucocorticoid-induced muscle wasting in patients with pemphigus, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with PAD. One small clinical trial in patients with PAD shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams twice daily for 3 weeks may improve walking distances in people with PAD ( 3631 ). However, another small clinical trial in patients with PAD or coronary heart disease shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams two hours before exercise does not improve endurance ( 58196 ). Also, adding L-carnitine 1 gram twice daily to cilostazol therapy for 180 days does not appear to confer additional benefit in this patient population ( 59023 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial for improving pregnancy rates or cardiovascular risk in people with PCOS. The effect of L-carnitine on body composition has promising results. Clinical research shows that adding L-carnitine 3 grams daily for 3 months to standard clomiphene plus metformin therapy improves menstrual regularity by 20%, ovulation rate by 24%, and pregnancy rate by 21% when compared with placebo ( 102123 ). Preliminary clinical research in patients with PCOS who are resistant to both clomiphene and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams twice daily from day 3 of clomiphene treatment until HCG injection results in the presence of a dominant follicle in 64% of cycles and pregnancy in 20% of cycles ( 96936 ). However, L-carnitine may not be beneficial in combination with assisted reproductive technology (ART), including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Two small clinical studies in patients with PCOS receiving ART in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocol shows that adding L-carnitine 3000 mg daily starting on the second day of menstruation and continuing until the day of oocyte triggering or embryo transfer does not improve rates of oocyte maturity or retrieval, implantation, or pregnancy when compared with control ( 107409 , 115353 ). The effect of L-carnitine has also been examined on anthropometric and cardiovascular risk indices in patients with PCOS. One small clinical study shows that taking L-carnitine 250 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces body weight by 2.8 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 1.2 kg/m2, waist circumference by 1.7 cm, and hip circumference by 2.2 cm when compared with placebo ( 96935 ). A meta-analysis of this and other small studies also shows that L-carnitine modestly reduces BMI when compared with placebo in patients with PCOS ( 111873 ). Although several studies also show improvements in markers of glycemic control and insulin sensitivity, most research does not support beneficial effects on lipid levels, cardiovascular risk, or liver fat content ( 96935 , 107402 , 107404 , 115353 ). more Rett syndrome. It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with Rett syndrome. Two small clinical studies in children with Rett syndrome show that taking L-carnitine 100 mg/kg daily in two or three divided doses for up to 6 months modestly improves well-being, motor skills, sleep efficiency, and communication skills when compared with control or placebo ( 1433 , 58161 ). more Sarcopenia. Oral L-carnitine may be beneficial for preventing sarcopenia in adults over 75 years of age, but not in healthy older females. One small clinical trial in healthy, active, older females aged 65-70 years shows that taking L-carnitine, as L-carnitine-l-tartrate 1500 mg, daily for 24 weeks does not improve muscle strength or muscle mass when compared with placebo ( 96930 ). An additional preliminary clinical trial in females aged 60-75 years taking part in a twice weekly resistance exercise program shows that taking L-carnitine tartrate 1 gram daily with L-leucine 3 grams daily for 24 weeks does not improve muscle strength or volume when compared with taking L-leucine 4 grams daily or no supplementation ( 111880 ). These studies were small and may have been underpowered to detect differences. In contrast, in weaker adults 75 years of age and older, taking L-carnitine 2-4 grams daily for 1-6 months increases muscle mass by approximately 2-4 kg when compared with placebo ( 16109 , 16111 ). more Sepsis. Small clinical studies suggest that intravenous L-carnitine may not reduce mortality in patients with sepsis, although patients with more severe sepsis may see some benefit. Meta-analyses of generally low-quality small clinical trials in patients with sepsis shows that intravenous administration of L-carnitine, 2-6 grams as a bolus followed by a 4-12 gram infusion, does not reduce the risk of 28-day or 1-year mortality when compared with placebo ( 104180 , 111868 ). However, in a subgroup analysis of patients with more severe sepsis, classified as those with a sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) of greater than 12, the risk of 1-year mortality was reduced by 32% when compared with placebo ( 104180 ). more Spinal muscular atrophy. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for spinal muscular atrophy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose. Toxin-induced liver damage. Small clinical studies have evaluated oral and intravenous L-carnitine for the management of liver damage caused by different classes of drugs, including antimycobacterial antibiotics and asparaginase-based agents, with promising results. The antimycobacterial antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis, including isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide, have been associated with hepatotoxicity ( 90922 ). Clinical research shows that taking L-carnitine 2 grams in two divided doses daily for 4 weeks along with a standard treatment regimen for tuberculosis reduces the percentage of treatment-naïve patients with drug-induced hepatotoxicity by almost half when compared with placebo ( 26499 ). The asparaginase-based medications have also been associated with hepatotoxicity. Two case series of children with hyperbilirubinemia caused by treatment with L-asparaginase or pegaspargase show that administering intravenous L-carnitine 50-100 mg/kg daily improves bilirubin levels ( 100353 , 100354 ). One case series also suggests that taking oral L-carnitine 50-100 mg/kg daily can help to prevent hyperbilirubinemia in patients with a history of asparaginase-induced hepatotoxicity ( 100353 ). more Traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for TBI, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose. Urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral L-carnitine is beneficial in children with UTIs. One small clinical trial in children 6 months to 10 years of age shows that taking L-carnitine 50 mg/kg daily as a syrup along with antibiotics for 7 days prevents renal scarring associated with acute pyelonephritis. Kidney damage was resolved in 50% of children taking L-carnitine, compared with 13% of children taking placebo. There were no differences in urine cultures between groups ( 101568 ). more Venous leg ulcers. Although there has been interest in using oral L-carnitine for venous leg ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-carnitine for this purpose. Theophylline-induced cardiac toxicity . It is unclear if intravenous L-carnitine is beneficial in patients with theophylline-induced cardiac toxicity. One small clinical trial shows that intravenous administration of L-carnitine 100 mg/kg over 30-60 minutes followed by 50 mg/kg every 8 hours along with intravenous propranolol within 24 hours of theophylline intoxication improves symptoms associated with theophylline-induced cardiac toxicity when given along with standard treatment. This combination led to greater improvements than either agent used alone. These included improvements in serum theophylline levels, heart rate, arrhythmia, mean arterial pressure, and duration of hospital stay. When L-carnitine was used without propranolol, only respiratory rate and theophylline levels over 24 hours were improved to a greater extent than with standard treatment alone ( 101566 ). more More evidence is needed to rate L-carnitine for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. L-carnitine has been safely used in clinical trials lasting up to 12 months ( 1947 , 3620 , 3621 , 3623 , 3624 , 3625 , 3626 , 3627 , 3628 , 3629 ) ( 3630 , 3639 , 4949 , 8047 , 9790 , 12352 , 16104 , 16105 , 16106 , 16107 ) ( 16109 , 16110 , 23437 , 26496 , 26499 , 58150 , 58156 , 58161 , 58169 , 58182 ) ( 58189 , 58204 , 58207 , 58209 , 58213 , 58294 , 58523 , 58554 , 58556 , 58647 ) ( 58679 , 58715 , 58778 , 58793 , 58830 , 58831 , 58882 , 59023 , 59029 , 59043 ) ( 90624 , 90633 , 104177 , 111872 , 111876 , 111883 , 111884 , 111891 , 111898 ). ...when used parenterally as an FDA-approved prescription medicine. Avoid using D-carnitine and DL-carnitine. These forms of carnitine can act as competitive inhibitors of L-carnitine and may cause symptoms of L-carnitine deficiency ( 1946 ). CHILDREN: Possibly Safe when used orally or intravenously and appropriately. L-carnitine has been safely used orally in children for up to 6 months ( 1433 , 3622 , 58166 , 58502 , 58981 , 59188 , 111887 , 111900 , 115351 ). It has also been safely used orally and intravenously in preterm infants ( 3633 , 3634 , 3635 , 3636 , 3637 , 58163 , 58190 , 58800 , 58902 , 59097 )( 59161 ). PREGNANCY: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using. LACTATION: Possibly Safe when used orally. Supplemental doses of L-carnitine have been given to infants in breast milk and formula with no reported adverse effects. The effects of large doses used while nursing are unknown, but L-carnitine is secreted in the breast milk ( 3616 ).</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: L-carnitine is most commonly used at a dose of 2 grams daily. Doses ranging from 1-4 grams daily, most often taken in divided doses, have been used for up to 1 year. Doses of 6 grams or 50-100 mg/kg daily have been used for up to 6 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Intravenous: Dosing of intravenous L-carnitine varies depending on the condition being treated. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Topical: L-carnitine has been used in various topical formulations, including as eye drops and a topical solution. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Children Oral: L-carnitine is most commonly dosed at 50-100 mg/kg daily. These doses have been used for up to one year. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Intravenous: Dosing of intravenous L-carnitine varies depending on the condition being treated. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization &amp; Formulation In clinical trials, liquid formulations or syrups of L-carnitine have been used orally ( 26498 , 26499 , 58523 , 59029 , 90623 , 101568 ). Also, L-carnitine has been administered as tablets or capsules in other clinical research ( 58176 , 58554 ). Specific tablets containing L-carnitine 330 mg/tablet (Carnitor, Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals) or oral solutions containing L-carnitine 1 gram per 10 mL (Carnitor or Carnitor SF, Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals) have been approved by the FDA to treat primary carnitine deficiency or secondary carnitine deficiency due to an inborn error of metabolism. The oral solution Carnitor SF is sugar-free ( 3616 ). Intravenous L-carnitine solutions have also been used in some clinical research ( 58472 , 59059 , 101566 ). A specific intravenous solution containing L-carnitine 1 gram per 5 mL (Carnitor, Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals) has been approved by the FDA to treat primary carnitine deficiency, to treat secondary carnitine deficiency due to an inborn error of metabolism, or to treat or prevent carnitine deficiency in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis ( 3616 ). Formulations containing D,L-carnitine have been used in some clinical trials ( 3620 , 3621 ). However, there is concern about using formulations containing D-carnitine. This form of carnitine can act as a competitive inhibitor of L-carnitine and cause symptoms of L-carnitine deficiency ( 1946 ).</data><data key="interactions_text">Expand All | Collapse All ACENOCOUMAROL (Sintrom) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, L-carnitine might increase the anticoagulant effects of acenocoumarol. L-carnitine might enhance the anticoagulant effects of acenocoumarol, an oral anticoagulant similar to warfarin, but shorter-acting ( 9878 , 12165 ). There are at least two case reports of INR elevation with concomitant use. In one case, a 33-year-old male with a previously stable INR had an elevated INR of 4.65 after L-carnitine was started and continued for 10 weeks. INR normalized after discontinuation of the L-carnitine-containing product ( 12165 ). more THYROID HORMONE Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, L-carnitine might decrease the effectiveness of thyroid hormone replacement. L-carnitine appears to act as a peripheral thyroid hormone antagonist by inhibiting entry of thyroid hormone into the nucleus of cells ( 12761 ). Taking L-carnitine also seems to diminish some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism ( 8047 ). more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, L-carnitine might increase the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. L-carnitine might increase the anticoagulant effects of acenocoumarol, a shorter-acting oral anticoagulant similar to warfarin ( 9878 , 12165 ). There is not enough information to know whether this interaction occurs with L-carnitine and warfarin. more</data><data key="name">L-Carnitine</data><data key="scientific_name">(3-carboxy2-hydroxypropyl) trimethylammonium hydroxide inner salt, (R)-(3-carboxy-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethylammonium hydroxide, (R)-3-hydroxy-4-trimethylammonio-butyrate, 3-carboxy-2-hydroxy-N,N,N-trimethyl-1-propanaminium inner salt, 3-hydroxy-4-N-trimethylaminobutyrate, Beta-hydroxy-gamma-trimethylammonium butyrate, B-hydroxy-N-trimethyl aminobutyric acid, L-3-hydroxy-4-(trimethylammonium)-butyrate</data><data key="overview_text">L-carnitine is an amino acid derivative.

It is the seventh most abundant element in the earth's crust by mass. It occurs in magnesite, dolomite, and in mineral waters ( 90051 ). Magnesium is well absorbed from foods ( 12587 ). Foods that are high in fiber are generally high in magnesium ( 13382 ). Dietary sources of magnesium include legumes, whole grains, vegetables (especially broccoli, squash, and green leafy vegetables), seeds, and nuts (especially almonds). Other sources include dairy products, meats, chocolate, and coffee. Water with a high mineral content, or "hard" water, is also a source of magnesium. Dietary intake of magnesium may be low, particularly among females ( 8088 , 12504 , 12505 ). Analgesic effects Magnesium is reported to be an antagonist at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are involved in the potentiation of pain. This effect and magnesium's depressant effects on nerves and smooth muscle are thought to contribute to the possible effects of magnesium in relieving symptoms associated with migraine headaches, postoperative pain, neuropathic pain, erythromelalgia, Raynaud's Phenomenon, and other vascular disorders and pain syndromes ( 6846 , 6848 , 8094 ). Magnesium might play a role in migraine headache. Low levels of magnesium may induce cerebral arterial vasoconstriction, increase platelet aggregation and promote serotonin release, and potentiate the vasoactive properties of serotonin ( 6844 , 12388 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Magnesium deficiency has been reported to be a trigger for inflammatory processes. A meta-analysis of 17 clinical trials comparing the effects of various magnesium salts, 250-500 mg daily for 4-26 weeks, on inflammatory markers shows that magnesium significantly decreases serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and increases nitric oxide (NO) levels when compared with placebo. However, it does not affect levels of serum interleukin (IL)-6, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione (GSH), or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha ( 108727 ). Antidiabetic effects There is some evidence that magnesium plays a role in diabetes and metabolic syndrome ( 1168 , 1183 ). In clinical research, oral magnesium has been reported to improve glycemic control in some patients with type 2 diabetes ( 1197 , 15548 , 60854 , 61032 , 96473 ). Low magnesium levels are associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and obesity ( 13369 , 13372 , 105918 ). Poorly controlled diabetes can cause enhanced osmotic diuresis and increase urinary loss of magnesium ( 13381 ). In severe hyperglycemia, tubular reabsorption of magnesium is decreased and may result in lower magnesium levels secondary to increased excretion ( 13365 ). Autonomic neuropathy and related autoimmune gastric atrophy may reduce intestinal absorption of magnesium. Also, insulin can increase magnesium excretion ( 13381 ). However, in patients with reasonably well-controlled type 2 diabetes, dietary magnesium absorption and retention don't appear to be impaired. Lower serum levels may be related to lower dietary intake ( 13375 ). Magnesium seems to affect glucose control and insulin homeostasis. Magnesium blood levels might play a role in insulin resistance ( 1168 , 6844 , 14304 , 17133 ). Insulin is involved with the shift of magnesium intracellularly. In turn, intracellular magnesium seems to regulate insulin activity on oxidative glucose metabolism. Low intracellular magnesium causes disorders in tyrosine kinase activity at the insulin receptor level, which results in decreased insulin sensitivity and insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Magnesium is also thought to enhance the action of enzymes involved in glucose utilization ( 13365 , 17133 ). Antioxidant effects Magnesium has antioxidant effects that can be reduced by calcium ( 61106 ). Cardiovascular effects Magnesium is known to be essential for all ATPase activity, including facilitating movement of calcium across and within the cell membrane of cardiac and vascular tissues ( 60920 ). In patients with congestive heart failure, there is evidence magnesium reduces coronary vascular resistance, increases coronary artery blood flow, has antiarrhythmic effects, and improves cardiac indexes ( 8088 ). There is interest in using magnesium for preventing endothelial function decline, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular events. A meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research suggests that taking magnesium for at least 6 months improves endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in patients who are unhealthy, over 50 years of age, or overweight ( 102455 ). There is also interest in the effects of magnesium on arterial stiffness, which is a predictor of coronary heart disease and stroke. In overweight adults, taking magnesium 450 mg daily as the citrate, oxide, or sulfate salts for 24 weeks does not affect arterial stiffness, measured by the carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity, when compared with placebo ( 108730 ). There is some evidence that magnesium is important in regulating blood pressure ( 1170 , 1182 ). Magnesium deficiency has been found to increase intracellular concentrations of sodium and potassium, which can lead to increased peripheral resistance and vasospasm ( 8088 ). In cell membranes, a decreased concentration of magnesium and increased calcium to magnesium ratio has also been associated with hypertension ( 8092 ). There is also some evidence that hypertensive patients with hypomagnesemia usually require more antihypertensive medications than hypertensive patients with normal magnesium levels ( 8088 ). Reduced intracellular magnesium also causes an increase in intracellular calcium. In addition to contributing to insulin resistance, higher intracellular calcium levels enhance calcium-mediated vasoconstriction, and inhibit cardiac and smooth muscle relaxation ( 13365 ). This increased vascular tone can increase blood pressure. There is some evidence that serum magnesium deficiency might play a role in both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke ( 8998 ). Deficiency Magnesium deficiency is not uncommon in the US. It's particularly prevalent among African Americans and the elderly. Low intake and impaired absorption of magnesium have also been associated with the development of various disease states such as osteoporosis, hypertension, atherosclerotic vascular disease, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and stroke ( 8088 , 8099 , 8998 , 9001 , 12510 , 12511 ). Hypomagnesemia is usually asymptomatic. The serum magnesium level is the most commonly used test to assess magnesium status. However, it is also known that the serum magnesium level is depressed only in cases of severe magnesium deficiency and that it poorly correlates with body magnesium ( 8089 ). The body preserves serum magnesium at the expense of magnesium in cells and bone, so serum levels may appear normal in magnesium deficiency ( 12510 , 12511 ). Red cell and urine magnesium levels also have been used but they are also poor indicators of body magnesium ( 8085 , 8089 ). The intravenous magnesium loading test is considered to be a more reliable test to measure magnesium status. However, the test is cumbersome and requires full participation from the patient. It is known that serum magnesium actually consists of three fractions. They are protein-bound, complexed, and free ionic magnesium. It is the free ionic magnesium that is biologically active. Whether the serum magnesium level is low or normal, free ionic magnesium levels have been shown to vary with many disorders such as cardiac disease, stroke, diabetes, and migraines. In recent years, instruments have become available that measure free ionic magnesium, allowing for a more accurate assessment of body magnesium. However, measurement of ionized magnesium may not be readily available in labs outside the research setting ( 8090 ). Symptoms of severe magnesium deficiency include convulsions; confusion; muscle weakness; abnormal muscle movements such as tremors, myoclonus, and tetany; and arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, and torsades de pointes ( 403 , 13383 ). Long-term magnesium deficiency might increase the risk of arrhythmias and the rate of developing atherosclerosis ( 13383 ). Gastrointestinal As antacids, magnesium salts work by reacting with gastric acid to form magnesium chloride. Magnesium hydroxide has the fastest onset of action, magnesium carbonate is slower due to its crystal structure, and magnesium trisilicate has the slowest onset and longest duration due to its poor solubility ( 6844 ). The laxative effects and diarrhea produced by magnesium salts are due to the osmotic effects of unabsorbed salts in the intestine and colon, and stimulation of gastric motility due to the release of gastrin and cholecystokinin ( 6844 ). Hormonal effects Intracellular levels of magnesium, measured in erythrocytes and leukocytes, have been found to be lower in females with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), leading to the use of magnesium supplements for PMS ( 6847 ). Oral magnesium has been reported to benefit mood changes associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) ( 1187 ). Supplementation of thyroid hormone to hypothyroid animals restored magnesium levels and transport. Therefore, thyroid hormones may have an effect on magnesium homeostasis ( 60899 ). Immune effects In clinical research, magnesium has been shown to decrease plasma cortisol levels ( 2826 ). Additional research suggests low serum magnesium is related to low-grade chronic inflammation. Hypomagnesemia is associated with elevated serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and C-reactive protein (CRP), which has been linked to metabolic syndrome ( 13366 ). Magnesium intake inversely correlates with CRP levels: females with high dietary magnesium intake have lower levels of CRP, which may reduce cardiovascular disease risk. The relationship is strongest in overweight or obese females (BMI &gt;25) and current or past smokers ( 13369 ). Other epidemiological research in adults has found that consuming less that the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for magnesium is associated with a 1.48 to 1.75 times higher risk of having an elevated CRP. In adults over age 40 with a BMI &gt;25, consumption of less than 50% of the RDA for magnesium correlates with a 2.24 times higher risk of elevated CRP ( 13371 , 13373 ). However, it is unclear if magnesium supplementation reduces CRP levels. One meta-analysis of 18 clinical trials including 927 patients with various conditions shows that supplemental magnesium does not reduce CRP levels when compared with placebo ( 105921 ). The included studies were not designed to assess CRP levels or baseline magnesium status, limiting the validity of this finding. Muscular effects Extracellular magnesium is critical to both maintaining nerve and muscle electrical potentials and transmitting impulses across neuromuscular junctions ( 272 ). The inhibitory effect of magnesium on preterm labor contractions (tocolysis) is attributed to antagonism of calcium-mediated myometrial contractions ( 6844 ). Oral magnesium has been reported to reduce the incidence of pregnancy-related leg cramps which may be associated with lower serum magnesium levels ( 1194 ). Magnesium was also found to be effective in preventing succinylcholine-induced muscle twitching, which is an adverse effect of patients undergoing general anesthesia ( 60834 ). Neurological effects Extracellular magnesium is critical to both maintaining nerve and muscle electrical potentials and transmitting impulses across neuromuscular junctions ( 272 ). Preliminary evidence shows magnesium may act as a neuroprotective agent in patients diagnosed with acute stroke. Several possible mechanisms of neuroprotection exist, including noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism and calcium channel antagonism ( 9000 , 9003 ).Magnesium levels also appear to be lower in acute attacks of paranoid schizophrenia ( 12584 ). In animal research, magnesium has been shown to have neuroprotective effects ( 60986 ). It was shown to prevent post-hypoxic brain injury by blocking the excess release of glutamate in the calcium channel. Fetal and newborn brains appear to be more susceptible to damage from glutamate release; therefore, blocking glutamate receptors through agents such as magnesium may reduce the risk of injury in the perinatal period. However, clinical studies to date have not shown a definite fetal neuroprotective benefit from prenatal administration of magnesium to pregnant patients, although prenatal magnesium therapy may improve motor function in early childhood for infants born prematurely ( 114681 ). The role of magnesium in the prevention or control of convulsions may involve blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the release of acetylcholine at the motor nerve terminals ( 61006 ). The mechanism of action for magnesium in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia is not clear. There is some evidence that magnesium dilates blood vessels in the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce ischemia. Contrary to this view are indications that magnesium may decrease CNS blood flow ( 9473 ). Additionally, magnesium may have anticonvulsant actions in eclampsia due to depression of neuromuscular transmission, direct depressant effect on smooth muscle, and CNS depression ( 6844 ). There is interest in using magnesium for improving symptoms of insomnia and other sleep disturbances. In a small clinical study in elderly patients with primary insomnia, magnesium intake increased levels of melatonin and reduced levels of cortisol, which might contribute to improved sleep ( 102458 ). Additionally, low magnesium levels have been linked to poor sleep quality and also to electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities during slow wave sleep. Magnesium has been theorized to regulate sleep by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress and by activating N-methyl-D-aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors ( 102456 ). Otic effects Oral magnesium treatment has been shown to reduce the incidence of temporary and permanent noise-induced hearing loss. It is hypothesized that magnesium may improve permanent hearing threshold shifts (NIPTS) ( 1205 , 60813 ). Pulmonary In asthma, intravenous administration of magnesium might cause bronchodilation ( 2003 , 60889 ). Renal effects There is some evidence that magnesium metabolism is a factor in renal stone formation and prevention ( 2006 , 2007 ). There is preliminary evidence that magnesium can reduce hypertension and nephrotoxicity induced by cyclosporine. Magnesium supplementation appears to reduce the thickening of the renal vascular walls that may occur with cyclosporine therapy; potassium supplementation may increase the effectiveness of magnesium for this use ( 9500 ). Skeletal effects Magnesium is important for normal bone structure ( 272 ), and plays an essential role in more than 300 cellular reactions ( 945 ). Magnesium is required for the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and is involved in ion movements across cell membranes ( 945 ). It is involved in protein synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism ( 272 ). Magnesium deficiency increases the formation and activity of osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells). Magnesium deficiency causes increases in substance P and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in bone, which increase osteoclastic bone resorption. Increased bone resorption causes release of magnesium as well as calcium from bone. Since magnesium is an essential nutrient, the body may sacrifice bone in times of deficiency as a magnesium source to maintain homeostasis ( 12499 , 12500 ). Magnesium deficiency might be a risk factor for postmenopausal osteoporosis, but its exact role is unknown ( 7555 ). Magnesium, like calcium, is regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH). In humans, severe to moderate magnesium deficiency commonly causes hypocalcemia. Normally, magnesium deficiency increases PTH activity. PTH increases renal calcium reabsorption, increases phosphate excretion, and increases renal magnesium reabsorption. Impaired parathyroid hormone (PTH) activity and impaired response to PTH seem to be the predominant reasons that magnesium-deficient people are also hypocalcemic ( 12499 ). However, clinical research shows that magnesium sulfate 350 mg taken daily by mouth for 3 weeks does not affect calcium blood levels in patients with hypoparathyroidism taking maintenance therapy of calcium and a vitamin D analog ( 90010 ). Clinical research suggests that magnesium, alone or in combination with calcium, vitamin D, and zinc, reduces bone turnover ( 60928 , 60934 , 60950 ). In combination with calcium, vitamin D, and other minerals, magnesium increases bone density ( 36840 ). Magnesium supplementation in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis results in decreased serum iPTH and urinary deoxypyridinoline and increased serum osteocalcin ( 60928 , 60950 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Likely Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Magnesium</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Effective Bowel preparation. Various magnesium salts are used for cleansing the bowel prior to procedures such as colonoscopy. Various magnesium salts, including citrate, hydroxide, oxide, and sulfate, are ingredients in bowel preparation products available over-the-counter or by prescription only. more Constipation. Magnesium salts are effective when used short-term orally to treat constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Magnesium citrate, hydroxide, oxide, and sulfate salts are commonly used as laxatives. Magnesium citrate 11.3-17.45 grams has been used; magnesium hydroxide 2.4-4.8 grams, as 30-60 mL of milk of magnesia, has also been used ( 113483 , 113484 ). Magnesium sulfate, also known as Epsom salt, which seems to have the most potent effect, has been used as 10-30 grams ( 6430 , 113485 ). Magnesium salts should only be used for occasional treatment of constipation, and doses should be taken with a full 8-ounce glass of water. Magnesium oxide seems to be beneficial in adults with CIC when taken short-term. Clinical guidelines published by the American Gastroenterology Association and American College of Gastroenterology in 2023 give a conditional recommendation suggesting the use of magnesium oxide over managing CIC without magnesium oxide based on low-quality studies conducted over 4 weeks. The recommended starting dose is 400-500 mg daily with dose titration per symptom response and side effects ( 112859 ). A small clinical study in patients with CIC who are not taking chronic medications shows that taking magnesium oxide 1.5 grams in three divided doses daily for 28 days increases spontaneous bowel movements when compared with placebo ( 104397 ). It is unknown if magnesium is beneficial for CIC when used long-term. more Dyspepsia. Magnesium salts are effective when used orally as antacids. Magnesium carbonate, hydroxide, oxide, or trisilicate salts are used orally as antacids to reduce symptoms of gastric hyperacidity or gastroesophageal reflux. Magnesium hydroxide has the fastest onset of action. The onset for magnesium carbonate is slower due to its crystal structure. Magnesium trisilicate has the slowest onset and longest duration of action due to poor solubility ( 6844 ). Doses used include magnesium hydroxide 400-1200 mg (5-15 mL of milk of magnesia) up to four times daily, or magnesium oxide 800 mg daily ( 15 ). more Eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate is considered the drug of choice for control of seizures. Intravenous (IV) and/or intramuscular (IM) magnesium sulfate is considered the agent of choice for seizure prophylaxis during eclampsia by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) ( 15 , 12591 , 12592 , 61012 , 61184 ). Typical doses include 4-6 grams of magnesium sulfate by IV infusion in 250 mL of dextrose 5% or normal saline solution, followed by 4-5 grams of magnesium sulfate IM every 4 hours, or 1-3 grams per hour by continuous IV infusion. Doses should be adjusted according to serum levels and urinary excretion, and should not exceed 30-40 grams of magnesium sulfate daily ( 15 , 12591 ). Meta-analyses of clinical research show that treatment with IV or IM magnesium reduces the risk of seizure recurrence by 33% to 69% when compared with phenytoin, and by 47% to 60% when compared with diazepam ( 19960 , 60818 , 60954 , 60964 , 61105 ). One preliminary clinical study shows that lower doses of IV magnesium sulfate (9 grams loading dose and maintenance of 2.5 grams every 4 hours for 24 hours) are as effective as higher doses (14 grams loading dose and maintenance of 5 grams every 4 hours for 24 hours) for reducing the recurrence of eclamptic seizures ( 89383 ). It is generally recommended that treatment be continued for at least 24 hours after the last seizure ( 15 ). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for eclampsia. more Hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia can be effectively treated with oral or parenteral magnesium. Taking magnesium orally or parenterally is helpful for treating and preventing hypomagnesemia associated with alcoholism, cirrhosis of the liver, congestive heart failure (CHF), severe or prolonged diarrhea or vomiting, kidney dysfunction, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pancreatitis, malabsorption syndromes, and other conditions ( 6280 , 6281 , 8088 , 8089 ). The dose and salt of magnesium for oral replacement therapy should be chosen carefully to avoid causing diarrhea. The gluconate and chloride salts cause less diarrhea, while the oxide salt is more likely to cause diarrhea and should be avoided. Magnesium chloride should also be avoided due to poor solubility which decreases absorption ( 6430 , 8099 , 10664 ). Orally, magnesium sulfate 3 grams every 6 hours for four doses has been used for hypomagnesemia ( 15 ). Parenteral magnesium doses must be individualized according to serum magnesium levels, but a typical starting dose for mild deficiency is 1 gram of magnesium sulfate intramuscularly (IM) every 6 hours for 4 doses ( 15 ). For more severe deficiency, 5 grams of magnesium sulfate may be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion in 1 liter of dextrose 5% or normal saline solution over 3 hours ( 15 ). more Pre-eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate is considered the drug of choice for seizure prophylaxis in patients with pre-eclampsia. Intravenous (IV) and/or intramuscular (IM) magnesium sulfate is considered the agent of choice for seizure prophylaxis during pre-eclampsia by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) ( 12591 , 12592 , 61012 , 61184 ). Some meta-analyses show that IV administration of magnesium sulfate reduces the risk of eclampsia when compared with placebo, phenytoin, or diazepam in patients with pre-eclampsia ( 19960 , 60818 , 60960 , 60979 ). A typical initial dose is 4-5 grams of magnesium sulfate by IV infusion in 250 mL of dextrose 5% or normal saline solution, followed by 4-5 grams of magnesium sulfate IM every 4 hours, or 1-3 grams of magnesium sulfate per hour by continuous IV infusion. Doses should be adjusted according to serum levels and urinary excretion, and should not exceed 30-40 grams of magnesium sulfate daily ( 15 , 12591 ). The optimal duration of prophylaxis has not been determined. A meta-analysis suggests that using a shorter duration of 12 hours or less is not associated with an increase in risk of eclamptic seizures when compared with regimens of 24 hours or longer ( 108732 ). However, studies are likely underpowered due to the low incidence of eclampsia. Oral magnesium has been evaluated for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in healthy adults, but taking magnesium citrate 300 mg daily, starting at 12-20 weeks' gestation and continuing until delivery, does not reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia when compared with placebo ( 103724 ). more Likely Effective Cerebral palsy. Most evidence shows that antenatal magnesium reduces the risk of cerebral palsy in preterm infants, although there are some inconsistent results. Most clinical studies and meta-analyses show that antenatal magnesium sulfate reduces the risk of cerebral palsy by about 32% and the risk of motor dysfunction by about 45% in preterm infants ( 60915 , 60927 , 60931 , 61001 , 97485 , 103734 , 103754 , 114675 , 114681 ). The lowest effective dose of magnesium sulfate seems to be 4 grams intravenously, with or without a maintenance dose of 1 gram/hour until birth or for 24 hours. In obese females, a higher dose, based on body weight, may be needed ( 97485 , 97495 , 103734 , 103754 ). However, some studies have inconsistent results ( 8093 , 19998 , 98293 , 98295 , 112784 ). Giving females at risk of imminent preterm birth (prior to 32 weeks), intravenous magnesium sulfate 4.5 grams over 20 minutes followed by 1 gram per hour until birth or for 24 hours, in addition to a standard treatment protocol, does not reduce the incidence of cerebral palsy ( 112784 ). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this purpose. more Seizures. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is used for treating seizures of various etiologies. Intravenous magnesium sulfate may be useful for controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis, hypothyroidism, and acute nephritis in children ( 15 ). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this purpose. more Torsades de pointes. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is the first-line treatment for torsades de pointes after measures to correct precipitating factors have been unsuccessful. Intravenous magnesium sulfate has been used successfully to treat the life-threatening ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes ( 15 , 6844 ). The Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines of the American Heart Association recommend a dose of 1 to 2 grams diluted in 50-100 mL Dextrose 5% solution given IV over 5-60 minutes, followed by a continuous IV infusion of 0.5-1 gram/hour. more Possibly Effective Arrhythmia. Magnesium sulfate is effective for the specific type of ventricular tachycardia known as torsades de pointes, and seems to be helpful for treating other types of arrhythmias. Evidence for the role of oral or intravenous magnesium in preventing postoperative arrhythmias is conflicting. Administering magnesium intravenously or orally may be helpful for treating atrial and ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, and supraventricular tachycardia ( 9497 , 13352 , 13354 , 13355 , 13356 , 60804 , 60829 , 60877 , 61113 , 111696 ). Arrhythmias associated with congestive heart failure have been treated with magnesium sulfate 8 grams infused over 12 hours ( 9497 ). For rate control in atrial fibrillation, magnesium sulfate 2.5 grams IV over 20 minutes, followed by 2.5 grams IV over 2 hours has been used ( 13356 ). For paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, single doses of 1-4 grams of magnesium chloride have been used ( 13352 ). For atrial tachycardia, 2 grams of magnesium sulfate in 10 mL of dextrose 5% solution has been given IV over 1-10 minutes, followed by 5-10 grams of magnesium sulfate in 250-500 mL dextrose 5% solution as an IV infusion over 5 hours ( 13354 , 13355 ). Research on the effects of intravenous magnesium for preventing arrhythmias after cardiac surgery is conflicting. Some meta-analyses show that intravenous magnesium reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, or supraventricular arrhythmias following cardiac surgery by 23% to 48% when compared with placebo ( 60814 , 60826 , 60828 , 60838 , 61008 , 61033 , 61181 , 97487 , 97490 ). Doses of magnesium sulfate used include 30 mg/kg in 500 mL normal saline ( 97490 ), or 80-100 mg/kg added to the cardioplegia solution ( 97487 ). Also, one small study in adults after CABG surgery suggests that taking magnesium hydroxide 1600 mg orally reduces arrhythmia as effectively as receiving magnesium sulfate 2000 mg intravenously ( 99315 ). However, other meta-analyses that only include higher-quality trials show that magnesium supplementation does not reduce the risk of ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias following cardiac surgery ( 61010 , 61024 , 61031 , 105081 ). A meta-analysis of clinical trials of intravenous magnesium for prevention of new-onset atrial fibrillation after non-cardiac surgeries shows that it does not reduce the incidence significantly when compared with placebo ( 112778 ). However, there was a high risk of bias in the analysis, and variability in types of surgery, and the salt and dose of magnesium used. more Asthma. Parenteral magnesium sulfate can help to reverse severe acute asthma attacks and reduce the need for hospital admission. It is unclear if nebulized magnesium is beneficial for acute asthma attacks. However, oral magnesium does not seem to be beneficial. Overall, a single dose of intravenous magnesium seems to improve pulmonary function in acute asthma exacerbation and reduce the risk of hospitalization, particularly in patients with severe asthma, and those who have failed initial treatment with nebulized albuterol and intravenous corticosteroids ( 60888 , 90023 , 96483 , 104398 , 107365 ). The typical dose used for adults is 2 grams of magnesium sulfate infused over 20 minutes ( 15 ). For children, 25-75 mg/kg, to a maximum of 2 grams, infused over 20-30 minutes has been used ( 15 , 96483 , 107365 ). However, a post-hoc analysis of one large clinical trial ( 104400 ) designed to assess nebulized magnesium in children with acute asthma has found that adding IV magnesium to nebulized magnesium is associated with greater odds of hospitalization when compared with no IV magnesium ( 105919 ). This post-hoc analysis did not differentiate between precautionary and necessary hospitalizations. Although some clinical research and a meta-analysis in patients with acute asthma exacerbation show that nebulized magnesium in combination with standard treatment improves airway function, respiratory rate, and clinical asthma severity when compared with standard treatment alone, it is unclear whether these findings are clinically relevant ( 90016 , 113466 ). Most evidence, including larger clinical trials and meta-analyses, has not shown benefit of adjunct nebulized magnesium for acute asthma in adults or children ( 60888 , 90002 , 96484 , 104400 , 105920 , 113466 , 114674 ). Oral magnesium also does not seem to be beneficial. A meta-analysis of small clinical trials in children and adults with asthma shows that taking magnesium supplements orally does not improve lung function or reduce bronchodilator use when compared with control ( 104404 ). more Colorectal cancer. Increasing dietary magnesium intake seems to lower the risk of colon cancer but not rectal cancer. Epidemiological research shows that increased dietary magnesium intake is associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer, but the risk of rectal cancer is not affected ( 89387 , 90017 , 90027 , 101355 ). more Diabetes. Low dietary magnesium may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but evidence on the use of supplements for treating type 2 diabetes is conflicting. Higher dietary magnesium intake is associated with lower fasting insulin concentrations and a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults and obese children ( 13369 , 15548 , 96473 , 97486 , 98294 , 103736 , 105918 , 106920 ). In people with existing type 2 diabetes, hypomagnesemia is found in 25% to 38% of patients, especially in those with poorly controlled diabetes ( 1172 ). Population research in adults with type 2 diabetes also shows that a dietary magnesium intake of less than 250 mg daily is associated with a 56% higher risk of mortality. Preliminary subgroup analyses suggest that the risk of mortality is higher in those with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels above 7% ( 110051 ). A meta-analysis of small, heterogeneous clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes suggests that magnesium may modestly reduce HbA1C in patients with hypomagnesemia, but not in patients with normal magnesium levels, when compared with control ( 105075 ). Individual clinical studies using magnesium supplements in patients with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance have shown mixed results. Some research suggests magnesium supplements can decrease fasting blood glucose and improve insulin sensitivity, as well as reduce the risk of developing diabetes in high-risk patients ( 10664 , 12582 , 13376 , 60854 , 99313 , 106920 ), but other research shows no effect ( 1171 , 1172 , 13379 , 13380 , 112780 ). Discrepancies in these findings might reflect differences in magnesium salts and doses used, or differences in baseline magnesium status in study subjects. more Hypercholesterolemia. Magnesium may help improve lipid levels by a small amount in people with this condition. There is some evidence that taking magnesium oxide 1 gram orally daily for 6 weeks can produce small decreases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol levels, and small increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. However, magnesium does not seem to improve lipoprotein (a) levels ( 1193 ). Magnesium may also lower triglycerides in people with hypertriglyceridemia ( 97494 ). more Metabolic syndrome. Low dietary and serum levels of magnesium seem to be associated with the development of metabolic syndrome. Higher magnesium intake from diet and supplements is associated with a 27% lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome in healthy females ( 13371 ) and a 31% lower risk in healthy young adults ( 14304 ). Additional epidemiological research suggests that people with low serum magnesium levels are 6-7 times more likely to have metabolic syndrome than people with normal magnesium levels ( 13372 ). In a population analysis of over 6000 individuals without metabolic syndrome at baseline, the risk of developing this condition over a 6-year follow-up period was reduced by 16% in the highest quintile of dietary magnesium intake (median intake 371 mg daily) when compared with the lowest quintile (median intake 203 mg daily). Some, but not all, research suggests that the hazard ratio for metabolic syndrome in relation to magnesium intake may be U-shaped, with higher risk at intakes below about 150 mg daily and above 600 mg daily ( 108963 ). A combination of magnesium 20 mEq daily and potassium 40 mEq daily (magnesium potassium citrate) taken orally for 16 weeks reverses metabolic side effects of chlorthalidone, such as increased fasting plasma glucose and hypokalemia, more effectively than potassium chloride 40 mEq daily alone ( 112932 ). more Osteoporosis. Increased dietary and supplemental magnesium intake seems to increase bone mineral density and decrease bone loss in postmenopausal patients. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking magnesium hydroxide orally, 300-1800 mg daily for 6 months, then 600 mg daily for 18 months, or magnesium citrate orally 1830 mg daily for 30 days, might reduce bone loss and bone turnover in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis ( 9104 , 60928 ). Some epidemiological research also suggests that magnesium intake is related to increased bone mineral density ( 12501 , 12502 , 12503 , 12504 , 90014 ), although not all studies have found an association ( 12505 , 98286 ). more Postoperative pain. Injectable magnesium has been used with promising results for reducing pain and the need for other analgesics postoperatively. However, it is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for postoperative pain. A meta-analysis of 25 clinical trials shows that intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate, 5-50 mg/kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 6 mg/kg or 500 mg hourly during surgery, seems to reduce the 24-hour postoperative use of IV morphine by 24% when compared with placebo ( 19968 ). Adding IV magnesium sulfate 3.7-5.5 grams to patient-controlled analgesia for 24 hours after surgery has also been used ( 19968 ). Additionally, meta-analyses support that adjunctive IV or intrathecal administration of magnesium reduces post-operative pain scores, improves pain relief and sensory nerve block, and decreases the need for other analgesics, when compared with control ( 89390 , 90012 , 90015 , 98287 , 103728 , 114676 , 114677 , 114678 ). However, some data are conflicting. In a meta-analysis of 7 trials, IV magnesium was not associated with lower pain scores over the first 48 hours postoperatively. The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be explained by differences in magnesium regimens, anesthesia protocols, and surgical populations studied. Additionally, IV magnesium appears to be less effective than dexmedetomidine ( 105082 ). Two moderate-sized clinical studies in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty in China show that adding magnesium sulfate 2.5 mg/mL to the periarticular infiltration analgesia (PIA) cocktail or administering IV magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg before anesthesia induction then as a 15 mg/kg infusion during surgery reduces pain scores, increases comfort levels, limits and delays the use of postoperative opioids, prolongs analgesia, and reduces markers of inflammation when compared with the usual PIA cocktail or control ( 111181 , 113677 ). Administering magnesium intravenously also seems to be helpful for pain control after hysterectomy. A 3-gram IV bolus of magnesium sulfate followed by an infusion of 0.5 grams per hour for 20 hours has been used. Lower doses were not effective ( 6848 ). In males undergoing laparoscopic radical resection for gastrointestinal cancer, administering IV magnesium intraoperatively, as a loading dose of 40 mg/kg followed by 15 mg/kg/hour through the end of surgery, reduces postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort and analgesic requirements, when compared with placebo ( 112783 ). However, IV magnesium might not alleviate postoperative pain in children. Two small clinical studies show that administering a magnesium IV infusion does not reduce pain when compared with saline in children after tonsillectomy or after elective strabismus surgery ( 98282 , 105077 ). Oral magnesium has also been evaluated for postoperative pain. A small, single-center, clinical study in Thailand in adults undergoing oral surgery and taking postoperative ibuprofen shows that adding magnesium (Magnesium, Life Extension) 500 mg once prior to surgery and daily for 3 days post-surgery slightly improves self-reported pain at rest after 24 hours but not at other time points when compared with placebo ( 116617 ). These results are unlikely to be clinically significant. more Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Taking magnesium orally seems to relieve symptoms of PMS. There is some evidence that magnesium supplementation can improve symptoms, including mood changes and fluid retention, in some patients with PMS ( 1187 , 1188 , 6847 ). Doses used include magnesium oxide 333 mg daily for 2 menstrual cycles, or magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid equivalent to 360 mg elemental magnesium three times daily, from the 15th day of the menstrual cycle until onset of menstrual flow ( 1187 , 1188 ). Taking magnesium orally in a dose of 360 mg (elemental magnesium) three times daily for 2 months seems to prevent premenstrual migraine ( 1186 , 6847 ). A combination of magnesium 200 mg daily plus vitamin B6 50 mg daily seems to reduce anxiety-related premenstrual symptoms, including nervous tension, mood swings, irritability, and anxiety, when compared with placebo ( 8555 ). more Vasospastic angina. Intravenous magnesium seems to prevent coronary spasm in patients with this condition. Clinical research shows that administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate 65 mg/kg infused over 20 minutes dilates coronary arteries and suppresses acetylcholine-induced coronary spasms when compared with infusion of a dextrose solution in patients with vasospastic angina ( 8091 ). more Possibly Ineffective Altitude sickness. Taking magnesium citrate orally does not seem to reduce acute altitude sickness risk. Clinical research shows that taking magnesium citrate 1200 mg daily orally in three divided doses, beginning 3 days prior to mountain ascent and continuing until mountain descent, does not reduce the risk of acute altitude sickness when compared with placebo ( 60801 ). more Athletic performance. Taking magnesium orally does not seem to improve energy or endurance during athletic activity. Most evidence suggests that taking magnesium orally doesn't increase energy and endurance during athletic activity. Magnesium oxide, aspartate, and orotate salts do not seem to improve exercise performance when used alone or in combination with potassium, vitamin B6, or zinc ( 2825 , 2826 , 2828 , 2829 , 2830 , 60751 , 113655 ). more Bronchiolitis. Intravenous or nebulized magnesium is not beneficial in infants with this condition. Clinical research shows that administering a single IV dose of magnesium sulfate 100 mg/kg to infants with acute bronchiolitis does not improve, and may actually worsen, symptoms when compared with placebo ( 97482 ). A clinical study in infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis shows that adding nebulized magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg to nebulized epinephrine does not reduce hospital stay or the need for ventilator or oxygen support when compared with epinephrine alone ( 99317 ). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this use. more Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Research on the effects of intravenous infusions of magnesium and calcium for preventing oxaliplatin neurotoxicity are inconsistent, but higher quality studies seem to show no benefit. Pooled analyses of cohort studies and clinical trials show that calcium and magnesium infusions can decrease the incidence of severe oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity ( 90028 , 90029 , 90031 ). However, when only clinical trials are considered, the infusions do not appear to be helpful ( 90005 , 90029 , 90031 , 96474 , 96479 ). more Complex regional pain syndrome. Intravenous magnesium is not beneficial in complex regional pain syndrome type 1. Clinical research shows that receiving magnesium sulfate 70 mg/kg intravenously at the rate of 25 mL/hour for 4 hours each day for 5 days does not improve pain or level of impairment when compared with placebo in patients with chronic complex regional pain syndrome type 1 ( 89395 ). more Emergence delirium. The majority of small clinical studies in adults and children undergoing various surgeries suggest that intravenous (IV) magnesium doesn't reduce the risk of emergence delirium. However, most clinical studies in adults suggest that IV magnesium reduces emergence agitation. A small clinical study in adults undergoing surgery for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair shows that administering IV magnesium 30 mg/kg as a loading dose, followed by a 10 mg/kg/hour infusion for the duration of surgery, does not improve agitation or delirium scores when compared with administering saline ( 111182 ). Similarly, a small clinical study in children ages 2-5 years undergoing elective strabismus surgery shows that administering IV magnesium during anesthesia does not seem to prevent the occurrence of emergence delirium when compared with administering saline ( 105077 ). In a meta-analysis of 8 clinical trials in children aged 2-16 years undergoing general anesthesia for oral or ophthalmic surgery, giving IV magnesium as a 30 mg/kg loading dose followed by a 10 mg/kg/hour infusion, or as a single dose of 15-30 mg/kg, does not reduce emergence delirium scores, and may actually prolong emergence times ( 108729 ). However, there is some conflicting evidence. In patients undergoing radical mastectomy, giving intraoperative magnesium sulfate 30mg/kg over 1 hour, followed by 10 mg/kg/hour until the end of surgery, reduces emergence agitation (odds ratio 0.26) when compared with placebo ( 112781 ). more Menopausal symptoms. Oral magnesium oxide does not seem to be beneficial for menopausal hot flashes. A small, low quality study in postmenopausal patients with a history of breast cancer shows that taking magnesium oxide 400-800 mg orally daily reduces hot flashes when compared with baseline ( 102454 ). However, a larger, higher quality clinical study using magnesium oxide 800-1200 mg daily did not show any benefit when compared with placebo ( 98290 ). more Muscle cramps. Oral magnesium does not seem to improve muscle cramp frequency or intensity. Meta-analyses of small clinical trials show that magnesium supplementation for 3-6 weeks does not decrease the frequency or intensity of skeletal muscle cramps, whether the cramps are idiopathic or due to liver cirrhosis or pregnancy, when compared with placebo ( 90022 , 104395 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral magnesium does not seem beneficial for improving metabolic indices in patients with PCOS. A meta-analysis of moderate-quality clinical studies in Iran in patients with PCOS shows that taking magnesium 250 mg daily for 8-20 weeks does not improve glycemic indices, hormonal factors, lipid levels, or measures of body size (e.g., weight, waist circumference) when compared with placebo ( 116619 ) However, a clinical study, included in the above meta-analysis, shows that taking magnesium oxide orally, 250 mg daily for 10 weeks improves subjective measures of quality of life, fatigue, and emotional functioning, but not objective measures such as alopecia, abnormal uterine bleeding, or acne, when compared with placebo ( 108965 ). A clinical study using a combination of magnesium 250 mg with vitamin E 400 mg daily for 12 weeks shows a modest reduction in insulin resistance, insulin levels, and triglyceride levels, but not other lipid levels, when compared with placebo ( 100264 ). It is unclear if these beneficial effects are due to magnesium, vitamin E, or the combination. more Sickle cell disease. Intravenous magnesium does not add any benefit to standard therapy for sickle cell disease in children. Clinical research shows that giving magnesium sulfate 40-100 mg/kg (maximum of 2 grams per dose) intravenously every hour for 6-8 doses as an adjunct to standard therapy does not decrease hospital stay, pain, or opioid use, or improve quality of life, when compared with standard therapy and placebo in children with sickle cell disease ( 89399 , 98283 , 101356 ). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this purpose. more Stillbirth. Magnesium administered during pregnancy does not reduce stillbirth risk. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that magnesium supplementation does not significantly decrease the risk of stillbirths when administered during pregnancy ( 60925 , 60978 ). more Tetanus. Intravenous magnesium sulfate does not seem to improve outcomes in patients with this condition. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intravenous magnesium sulfate does not reduce mortality when compared with placebo or diazepam in patients with tetanus ( 61020 ). While some research shows that magnesium reduces the duration of hospitalization and the need for ventilation when compared with diazepam ( 61170 ), magnesium does not seem to improve these outcomes when compared with placebo ( 60860 ). more Traumatic brain injury (TBI). Magnesium does not improve clinical outcomes in patients with moderate to severe TBI. Its effect in patients with concussions is unclear. A meta-analysis of four clinical trials shows that treatment with magnesium does not significantly improve neurological outcomes or reduce the risk of mortality when compared with placebo in patients with moderate to severe TBI ( 60905 ). A small observational cohort study in adolescents with concussions has found that adding oral magnesium 400 mg twice daily for 5 days to standard treatment with acetaminophen and ondansetron is associated with a trend toward reduced symptom severity when compared with standard treatment alone ( 104401 ). The validity of this study is limited by its observational nature and small cohort size. more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Alcohol use disorder. Intravenous magnesium does not seem to help reduce symptoms of alcohol withdrawal but may reduce the duration of alcoholic delirium. Preliminary clinical research shows that administration of four intramuscular injections of magnesium sulfate 2 grams at 6-hour intervals does not reduce symptoms of alcohol withdrawal when compared with saline ( 61063 ). A small observational study in patients with alcoholic delirium has found that administering magnesium sulfate IV 50 mg/kg every 8 hours, in addition to usual sedation, is associated with a reduction of delirium by approximately 2 days, or 4 days when given every 12 hours in addition to dexmedetomidine, when compared with usual sedation alone ( 111180 ). However, half of patients had hypomagnesemia at baseline; it is unclear if effects would be similar for patients with normal magnesium levels. Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this purpose. more Allergic rhinitis (hay fever). Although there has been interest in using oral magnesium for allergic rhinitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of magnesium for this purpose. Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial in children with ADHD. Children with ADHD seem to have lower magnesium levels in their blood and hair ( 9969 , 100262 , 100263 ). A small clinical study in children aged 7-12 years with ADHD and magnesium deficiency shows that taking magnesium aspartate and lactate 6 mg/kg daily for 6 months might improve hyperactivity and magnesium levels when compared with control ( 1189 ). Another small clinical study in children with ADHD but without magnesium deficiency shows that taking magnesium 6 mg/kg daily along with vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks may modestly improve emotional problems, but not inattention or hyperactivity, as measured on the strength and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), when compared with placebo ( 105914 ). more Back pain. It is unclear if oral or intravenous magnesium is beneficial for acute or chronic back pain in adults. One open-label clinical study in adults with acute low-back pain shows that taking magnesium 365 mg once daily in addition to taking etodolac 400 mg twice daily for 10 days does not further reduce pain when compared with taking etodolac alone ( 105913 ). Magnesium has also been tried for chronic back pain. A small clinical study in patients with chronic low-back pain shows that receiving magnesium sulfate 1 gram in 250 mL normal saline intravenously every 4 hours for 2 weeks, followed by magnesium gluconate 100 mg and magnesium oxide 400 mg by mouth daily for 4 weeks, reduces pain severity when compared with placebo ( 90035 ). It is unclear if oral magnesium used alone is beneficial. more Bariatric surgery complications. It is unclear if oral magnesium supplementation improves metabolic parameters after bariatric surgery. A retrospective study of over 3000 post-bariatric surgery patients suggests that those who take oral magnesium supplements providing 100-450 mg elemental magnesium daily may have improved metabolic parameters over 4 years of follow-up. When patients taking magnesium supplements were compared with those not taking supplements, 11% and 18% had type 2 diabetes, respectively, 30% and 42% had hypertension, respectively, and 16% and 23% had elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, respectively. For patients with hypomagnesemia at baseline, supplementation seemed to result in greater benefits ( 108968 ). more Bipolar disorder. Taking magnesium orally might improve manic symptoms in some people with bipolar disorder; however, it is unclear how it compares to current standard of care. One preliminary clinical study shows that magnesium 40 mEq daily (Magnesiocard) for 32 weeks has similar effects to lithium in up to 50% of patients treated for rapid cycling bipolar affective disorder ( 61022 ). Another preliminary clinical study shows that magnesium oxide 375 mg orally daily plus verapamil 80 mg taken four times daily reduces manic symptoms more effectively than verapamil alone in patients with mania ( 60742 ). more Cancer-related neuropathic pain. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium is beneficial for this condition. Single 500 mg to 1 gram doses of magnesium sulfate seem to relieve neuropathic pain for up to four hours when compared to baseline ( 6846 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Cardiac arrest. Intravenous magnesium does not seem to be helpful in cardiac arrest; however, the risk of sudden cardiac death seems to be inversely correlated to higher plasma magnesium levels or dietary intake. It is unclear if magnesium supplementation is associated with similar risk reduction. Administering magnesium intravenously doesn't seem to improve successful resuscitation in people with cardiac arrest ( 1190 ). However, higher plasma magnesium levels and higher dietary magnesium intake might reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death, possibly by protecting against fatal ventricular arrhythmias. In the Nurses' Health Study, the risk of sudden cardiac death was 77% lower in females with the highest quartile of plasma magnesium levels when compared with the lowest quartile. Also, the risk was 37% lower in females with the highest quartile of dietary magnesium intake when compared with the lowest quartile ( 17132 ). more Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence regarding the effect of dietary magnesium on CVD risk is conflicting. Epidemiological research in some populations shows that increased dietary magnesium intake is associated with decreased mortality due to strokes, coronary heart disease, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure, but other epidemiological research does not show any effect on these risks ( 89391 , 90003 , 90009 , 90030 , 90036 , 103735 ). Reasons for the discrepancies may be related to serum levels of magnesium at baseline, risk of cardiovascular disease at baseline, use of concomitant medications such as diuretics, or the presence of concomitant conditions such as kidney dysfunction. A population analysis conducted in Denmark has found that magnesium intake from drinking water may be associated with cardiovascular mortality. The overall risk of cardiovascular death and death due to stroke was reduced by 4% in the lowest 3 quintiles of intake when compared with the highest quintile. However, the risk of death due to acute myocardial infarction was increased by 22% in the lowest quintile when compared with the highest ( 108726 ). The relevance of these results is unclear, given that the main dietary source of magnesium is food rather than drinking water. more Chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial in pediatric patients at risk for cisplatin-induced febrile neutropenia. A small clinical study in children with solid tumors aged 9 years and older shows that taking magnesium 250 mg daily while receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy reduces febrile neutropenia by 47% and septic shock by 57% when compared with not receiving magnesium. Results from this study suggest that four pediatric patients need to take oral magnesium to avoid one case of febrile neutropenia ( 104394 ). more Chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium is beneficial for chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. A meta-analysis of several lower quality clinical studies in adults in Japan with cancer receiving cisplatin shows that pretreatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate 5 to 20 mEq reduces the odds of chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner when compared to standard hydration therapy ( 115726 ). The validity of these findings is limited by heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including types of cancer, definitions of nephrotoxicity, and use of other nephroprotective therapies. more Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Limited evidence suggests that magnesium may help improve CFS symptoms, but this is controversial. In people with low red blood cell magnesium, there is some evidence that intramuscular injections of 1 gram magnesium sulfate given once weekly for 6 weeks might improve CFS symptoms ( 7556 ). However, there is additional evidence that most patients with CFS have normal magnesium stores, and measurement of red cell magnesium is a poor indicator of total magnesium stores ( 7557 , 8084 , 8085 , 8086 , 8087 ). more Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Intravenous, but not nebulized, magnesium may be helpful in acute exacerbations of COPD. Administering magnesium sulfate intravenously, 1.2-2.5 grams over 20 minutes, might be helpful for treating acute exacerbations of COPD ( 1208 , 6844 , 103733 ). Also, giving magnesium sulfate 2 grams intravenously seems to improve exercise capacity when compared with placebo ( 89384 ). A meta-analysis of studies using intravenous magnesium sulfate for COPD exacerbations shows that it reduces hospital admission and mean length of stay and improves dyspnea scores when compared with placebo. Based on the relative risk identified in the included studies, seven patients would need to receive intravenous magnesium to prevent one hospitalization. However, intravenous magnesium sulfate does not change the need for non-invasive ventilation and the available research did not evaluate intensive care unit (ICU) admission ( 108967 ). Nebulized magnesium has also been evaluated. In patients experiencing a COPD exacerbation, clinical research shows that administering nebulized magnesium sulfate with albuterol three times at 30-minute intervals does not improve pulmonary function as measured by the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) when compared with placebo ( 89393 ). Also, a meta-analysis of a small number of low-quality studies shows that nebulized magnesium does not reduce hospital admission or the need for ventilatory support, although it might modestly improve dyspnea scores and reduce ICU admissions, when compared with placebo ( 108967 ). more Cluster headache. It is unclear if a single intravenous dose of magnesium sulfate is beneficial for cluster headaches. Administering magnesium sulfate intravenously, 1 gram over 5 minutes, seems to improve cluster headaches when compared with baseline( 1184 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Cognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for cognitive impairment. A large observational study in adults with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis suggests that serum magnesium levels of 20.2-22.3 mg/dL are associated with the lowest odds of mild cognitive impairment, while serum magnesium levels below and above that range of values are associated with increased odds of mild cognitive impairment ( 111695 ). more Coronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if magnesium supplementation is beneficial for CHD. Clinical research shows that magnesium oxide 800-1200 mg daily for 3 months reduces platelet-dependent thrombosis by 35% when compared with placebo in patients with CHD ( 60759 ). It is unclear if this effect improves clinical outcomes. The effect of magnesium supplementation on coronary artery calcium has also been studied. A meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies in 196 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) shows that taking magnesium or increasing the concentration of magnesium in dialysate does not improve coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores when compared with standard therapy. However, magnesium reduced carotid intima-media thickness ( 111179 ). Similarly, a large clinical study in patients with CKD shows that taking slow-release magnesium hydroxide (Mablet, Denmark) 360 mg twice daily for 12 months does not slow the progression of CAC scores when compared with placebo ( 111178 ). This study may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for COVID-19. A small clinical study in patients hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 shows that taking magnesium 300 mg daily for the duration of hospitalization reduces the number of patients requiring oxygen therapy but not the duration of hospital stay when compared with placebo ( 114680 ). more Depression. It is unclear if magnesium is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of depression in adults. Some population research shows that dietary intake of elemental magnesium between 76-360 mg daily is associated with a reduced risk of depression, but there was no association with greater amounts of magnesium, and other population research shows no association at any intake level ( 96480 , 98289 ). For treatment of mild to moderate depression, one preliminary clinical study shows that taking magnesium chloride 2 grams orally daily for 6 weeks reduces depression scores by 56% and anxiety scores by about 52% when compared to baseline ( 96477 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. However, a small clinical study in adults with recurrent depression shows that taking magnesium aspartate 120 mg daily for 8 weeks, along with fluoxetine, does not improve depression scores when compared with patients taking fluoxetine and placebo ( 111185 ). Similarly, a very small crossover clinical study in adults with mild or moderate treatment-resistant depression shows that administering a single dose of IV magnesium sulfate 4 grams does not improve depression scores when compared with an infusion of 5% dextrose ( 96481 ). However, scores were evaluated 24 hours post-infusion which may be too soon to detect improvement. Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that elemental magnesium in doses of 100-400 mg is not recommended for adjunctive or monotherapy use in patients with depression ( 110318 ). more Diabetic foot ulcers. Oral magnesium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with grade 3 diabetic foot ulcers shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg plus vitamin E 400 IU daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces ulcer size when compared with placebo ( 101436 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to magnesium, vitamin E, or the combination. more Exercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral magnesium reduces muscle soreness in adults after resistance training. A very small study in healthy adults, ages 19-23, shows that taking magnesium glycinate 350 mg daily for 10 days seems to reduce muscle soreness after bench press exercise when compared with placebo ( 104399 ). more Fetal and premature infant mortality. It is unclear if antenatal intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate administration reduces the risk of fetal and premature infant mortality. Two meta-analyses of up to 7 clinical studies in patients at risk of preterm birth shows that antenatal IV magnesium sulfate administration does not reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal death when compared with placebo ( 114675 , 114681 ). more Fibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for this condition. A small clinical study shows that taking magnesium chloride orally 100 mg once daily for one month reduces mild to moderate, but not severe, stress associated with fibromyalgia when compared with placebo. It also reduces pain levels, but not to a clinically significant extent, and it does not affect sleep, fatigue, or quality of life ( 108964 ). Another small clinical study shows that taking magnesium citrate 300 mg daily for 8 weeks improves some symptoms of fibromyalgia, such as number of tender points and depression, when compared to baseline ( 89385 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Magnesium has also been evaluated in combination therapy. A small clinical study shows that taking a combination of magnesium hydroxide and malic acid (Super Malic tablets) orally decreases fibromyalgia-related pain and tenderness in some patients when compared with placebo ( 3262 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to magnesium, malic acid, or the combination. Additionally, a single-center, crossover clinical study in adults with fibromyalgia (primarily female patients) already receiving pharmacological therapy (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants) shows that taking a combination of magnesium 600 mg, coenzyme Q10, and tryptophan daily (Trimax 10, AS &amp; NL) for 3 months does not improve self-reported fatigue when compared to baseline ( 116616 ). more Fractures. Population research suggests that higher intakes of magnesium may reduce fracture risk. Observational research has found that higher dietary and supplemental magnesium intake is associated with a 34% lower odds of fracture when compared with lower magnesium intake ( 101395 ). more Gastric cancer. Population research suggests that higher intakes of magnesium may reduce gastric cancer risk. Observational research has found that higher dietary and supplemental magnesium intake is not associated with a reduced risk for gastric cancer when compared with lower intake ( 103730 ). more Hearing loss. Oral magnesium may prevent and improve hearing loss due to environmental factors or loud noises. Clinical research in healthy military recruits shows that taking magnesium aspartate 167 mg daily for 2 months prevents hearing loss from exposure to loud noises during basic military training when compared with placebo ( 1205 ). Also, in patients with acute-onset hearing loss that was not caused by environmental factors, taking magnesium aspartate 167 mg daily for 8 weeks seems to improve hearing loss when compared with placebo ( 60813 ). more Hypertension. Oral magnesium supplementation may modestly reduce blood pressure, although these changes are not likely to be considered clinically significant. Most research shows that taking oral magnesium supplements in daily doses that are at least as high as the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults and up to 1000 mg daily can lower diastolic blood pressure by about 2 mmHg in adults with or without hypertension ( 1192 , 1199 , 9465 , 15165 , 18111 , 96482 ). Significantly lower doses do not seem to have this effect ( 1180 , 1195 , 1197 , 8098 ). The effect of magnesium on systolic blood pressure is conflicting. Two meta-analyses shows that taking magnesium 212-970 mg daily does not lower systolic blood pressure in patients with or without hypertension ( 15165 , 115728 ). However, additional meta-analyses show that taking magnesium 120-970 mg daily can lower systolic blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner by about 2-4 mmHg in patients with or without hypertension ( 18111 , 96482 ). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be due to heterogenous methods, including dose and duration among clinical studies. In 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim stating that inconsistent and inconclusive evidence suggests that diets with adequate magnesium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure. Products bearing this claim must provide at least 84 mg of magnesium daily, but no more than 350 mg daily ( 107451 ). more Hypokalemia. It is unclear if intravenous or oral magnesium is beneficial for hypokalemia in patients with normal magnesium levels. A preliminary retrospective observational study in patients with hypokalemia and unknown serum magnesium levels has found that administering oral or intravenous magnesium is not associated with improved time to normalization of serum potassium levels when compared with no magnesium treatment ( 110049 ). However, hypokalemia with concurrent hypomagnesemia can impede potassium repletion and exacerbate hypokalemia-induced rhythm disturbances. Standard of care in patients with hypokalemia and known hypomagnesemia includes prompt treatment with magnesium ( 110063 ). more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for prediabetes. Preliminary clinical research in patients with prediabetes shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels when compared with placebo. Taking magnesium also did not affect blood pressure, body weight, triglyceride levels, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; however, it did modestly improve high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ( 110053 ). more Insomnia. Oral magnesium may modestly improve sleep complaints in adults, but evidence is conflicting. A meta-analysis of two small clinical studies in healthy older adults with or without insomnia suggests that taking magnesium reduces the time to fall asleep by an average of 17 minutes when compared with placebo ( 105917 ). However, it does not increase the time spent asleep. Also, these findings are limited by imprecision and a high risk of bias. Studies included in the analysis used elemental magnesium 500-729 mg daily (as magnesium oxide) for up to 8 weeks ( 102458 , 105917 ). Another small clinical study in patients with poor sleep quality and low magnesium status shows that taking elemental magnesium 320 mg (as magnesium citrate) in divided doses daily for 7 weeks does not improve sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), when compared with a sodium citrate placebo ( 102456 ). Magnesium has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A very small crossover clinical study in patients aged 18-40 years without a sleep disorder shows that taking a combination of magnesium 300 mg, L-tryptophan 1000 mg, glycine 3000 mg, tart cherry 220 mg, and theanine 200 mg for 3 days reduces the time to fall asleep by about 24 minutes, increases total time asleep by about 22 minutes, and improves sleep efficiency, but does not improve the total time in bed or wakefulness after falling asleep when compared with cellulose placebo ( 111184 ). Another small crossover clinical study in adults with sleep disturbances shows that taking a combination of magnesium 200 mg and melatonin nightly for 4 weeks improves sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, reduces the length of time it takes to fall asleep by about 17 minutes, and improves some other measures of sleep, such as sleep efficiency and number of awakenings, when compared with placebo. However, despite these improvements, overall sleep quality was still categorized as poor after the intervention ( 116160 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to magnesium, other ingredients, or the combination. more Intraventricular hemorrhage. It is unclear if antenatal intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate can reduce the risk for intraventricular hemorrhage in neonates. A meta-analysis of clinical research in premature infants shows that if the mother received antenatal intravenous magnesium sulfate, the infant had a non-significant trend toward a reduced risk of intraventricular hemorrhage when compared with infants whose mothers received placebo ( 103727 ). This analysis may have been insufficiently powered to detect a difference between groups. Another meta-analysis of up to 6 clinical studies, some of which are included in the previously referenced meta-analysis, in patients at risk of preterm birth shows that maternal antenatal (IV) magnesium sulfate administration does not reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, but does reduce the risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage by about 24% when compared with placebo ( 114681 ). more Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Taking magnesium orally may prevent the recurrence of kidney stones, although evidence is conflicting. Prophylactic treatment with magnesium hydroxide, 200 mg twice daily for one year, followed by 500 mg daily for another year, might decrease the recurrence rate of calcium stone formation ( 2007 ). However, magnesium oxide does not seem to benefit patients considered to be recurrent calcium stone formers when compared with placebo, no treatment, or chlorthalidone ( 8097 , 38501 , 61199 ). Magnesium oxide 300 mg in combination with vitamin B6 10 mg daily seems to decrease urinary oxalate levels in people with hyperoxaluria who have previously had kidney stones ( 1201 ), but it is unclear if this effect translates into a reduced incidence of kidney stones. more Liver cancer. Increased dietary magnesium intake is linked with a lower risk of liver cancer. Observational research in retired older Americans has found that higher dietary magnesium intake is associated with a 35% lower risk of liver cancer when compared with lower intake. This association was especially strong in persons who were moderate or heavy alcohol users ( 105080 ). more Lung cancer. Supplemental or dietary magnesium intake does not seem to reduce the risk of lung cancer. A large epidemiological cancer screening trial with a mean follow-up of over 12 years suggests there is no association between dietary or supplemental magnesium intake and the risk of lung cancer. However, dietary magnesium seems to play an important yet unclear role in lung cancer prevention when taken as part of the diet with alpha-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, lycopene, selenium, lutein, and zeaxanthin ( 112096 ). more Migraine headache. Oral magnesium may help prevent migraine in some adults and children. Also, intravenous magnesium may help treat migraine in adults, but evidence is conflicting. A meta-analysis of 4 low-quality clinical studies, in adults with migraine shows that magnesium 122-600 mg daily for 4-16 weeks modestly reduces migraine frequency and severity when compared with placebo( 115730 ). However, clinical significance is unclear, and the validity of these findings is limited by heterogeneous methods between clinical trials, including type of magnesium formulation and dose, patient population, and duration. In contrast, one small clinical study shows that taking magnesium does not reduce migraine frequency and severity by at least 50% in adults when compared with placebo ( 10661 ). Limited evidence suggests that adding oral magnesium to conventional treatment may also be beneficial. A clinical study in adults with migraine living in Iran shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg twice daily in addition to sodium valproate 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces severity and duration of migraine, but not migraine frequency, when compared with taking sodium valproate alone ( 105915 ). It is unclear if these improvements would be considered clinically significant. For treatment of migraine, some adults with normal magnesium levels respond to intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate 1 gram over 5 minutes, but most patients who benefit have low magnesium levels at baseline ( 1185 , 6844 ). Effects of IV magnesium in patients with unknown magnesium levels are conflicting. Some preliminary clinical research shows that magnesium 1-2 grams IV alleviates acute migraine for up to 2 hours, but other research has found no benefit ( 89388 , 97493 , 98285 ). In children, treatment with magnesium oxide orally 15 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses for up to 16 weeks reduces the frequency and severity of migraine headaches when compared with placebo ( 10663 ). However, adding magnesium sulfate 400 mg orally daily to ibuprofen or acetaminophen does not further reduce migraine severity in children ( 89396 ). more Miscarriage. Oral magnesium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in pregnant adults with threatened miscarriage between the 6th and 13th week of gestation shows that taking a specific combination product (DAV HA, Lo.Li pharma s.r.l) containing magnesium 450 mg, alpha-lipoic acid, hyaluronic acidvitamin B6, and vitamin D daily in combination with conventional treatment of vaginal progesterone over 2 weeks of observation results in a faster resorption of the subchorionic hematoma and faster decrease of patient-reported vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and uterine contractions when compared with vaginal progesterone alone ( 113893 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to magnesium, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo in the control group. more Myocardial infarction (MI). Research on the effects of intravenous or oral magnesium after myocardial infarction are conflicting. Administering magnesium intravenously doesn't seem to reduce mortality after an acute MI ( 8999 , 13357 , 13358 , 13359 , 13360 , 19990 , 60872 , 61082 ), although there is some conflicting evidence from a meta-analysis of clinical research that shows that intravenous magnesium sulfate may reduce short-term mortality by 55% when compared with placebo ( 60795 , 60895 ). Clinical research with oral magnesium supplementation has found no benefit ( 1198 , 6844 ). more Neonatal encephalopathy. Intravenous magnesium may improve short-term outcomes in neonates with encephalopathy. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intravenous magnesium may improve short term outcomes of neonatal encephalopathy (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, HIE). However, long term outcomes are not affected ( 90025 ). more Nocturnal leg cramps. It is unclear if oral magnesium is helpful for nocturnal leg cramps. Some clinical research in adults with nocturnal leg cramps shows that taking magnesium oxide 865 mg daily at bedtime for 4 weeks does not reduce the frequency of leg cramping episodes when compared with placebo ( 96478 ). However, four weeks may be too short a time to see a benefit. In other clinical research, taking oral magnesium oxide monohydrate 226mg daily at bedtime for 60 days reduces the frequency of leg cramps when compared with placebo. This reduction was not seen after 30 days. Magnesium also reduced cramp duration and improved sleep quality, but did not affect pain scores, at 60 days when compared with placebo ( 106919 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral magnesium hydroxide has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking magnesium hydroxide 150 mg and L-carnitine 2000 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve liver stiffness scores when compared with baseline or controls who took placebo for 8 weeks followed by this magnesium and L- carnitine combination for 8 weeks. Taking magnesium and L-carnitine also did not improve levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) when compared to baseline ( 111177 ). more Obesity. Evidence on the use of magnesium for weight loss in obese patients is conflicting; any benefit is likely small at best. A meta-analysis of 7 clinical studies in obese patients shows that taking magnesium reduces body mass index (BMI) by 0.3 when compared with control ( 103723 ). Another meta-analysis of 7 studies in obese patients shows that while magnesium supplementation does not reduce weight, it reduces waist circumference by 2 cm when compared with placebo ( 103729 ). Interestingly, subgroup analyses did not find that the dose of magnesium or baseline magnesium levels impacted effectiveness. One subgroup analysis found that magnesium supplementation lasting 12 weeks or less seemed to be more beneficial for obesity than supplementation lasting longer than 12 weeks ( 103723 ). more Osteoarthritis. Population research has not found a link between magnesium intake and osteoarthritis risk. Observational research has found that dietary and supplemental magnesium intake is not associated with the risk of developing osteoarthritis ( 101395 ). more Overall mortality. It is unclear if oral or IV magnesium reduces the risk of overall mortality. A meta-analysis of heterogeneous observational studies has found that increased dietary magnesium intake, but not supplemental magnesium intake, is associated with a modestly reduced risk of overall mortality ( 105073 ). A meta-analysis of 3 small, low-quality clinical studies in ICU patients shows that administering IV magnesium 24-30 mmol or as a target-directed dose for 3 days reduces overall mortality when compared with patients who did not receive magnesium ( 111290 ). However, some studies included patients with hypomagnesemia; it is unclear if effects would be similar for patients with normal levels of magnesium. more Pain (acute). It is unclear if locally injected or intravenous magnesium is helpful for acute pain. Preliminary clinical research in patients with renal colic shows that intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate, 50 mg/kg infused over 20 minutes, is as effective as IV morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg for controlling acute renal pain at 20 minutes after the dose ( 107367 ). Magnesium has also been evaluated in a dental procedure. A single-center clinical study in India in adults with irreversible pulpitis requiring a root canal shows that a local injection of 0.2 mL of 10% magnesium sulfate with lidocaine and epinephrine reduces perioperative pain when compared to lidocaine with epinephrine alone ( 115729 ). more Pain (chronic). Population research suggests that higher intakes of magnesium may modestly reduce the risk for chronic pain. A cross-sectional observational study has found that increased magnesium intake is associated with a 7% to 8% reduced risk for chronic pain. The association was found to be stronger in females than in males ( 103732 ). more Parturition. It is unclear if topical magnesium is beneficial for labor duration. A single-center clinical study in Iranian adults shows that applying 10 mL of a 50% magnesium sulfate solution directly to the cervix during the active phase of labor reduces the time to vaginal delivery by approximately 1.5 hours and improves the childbirth experience, as reported by patients, when compared with placebo. However, clinical significance is unclear ( 115727 ). more Perioperative anxiety. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for perioperative anxiety. Preliminary clinical research in adults undergoing open heart surgery shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg orally twice daily during hospitalization moderately improves anxiety and depression scores when compared with no magnesium therapy. Magnesium therapy was held for the 2 days immediately following surgery ( 110054 ). more Physical performance. Oral magnesium may modestly improve physical performance in otherwise healthy, elderly females. Clinical research in otherwise healthy elderly females shows that taking a magnesium oxide supplement (Easymag, Sanofi-Aventis) 900 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly improves walking speed and chair stand speed in elderly females when compared with no treatment ( 90026 ). more Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It is unclear if intravenous (IV) magnesium is beneficial for PONV due to mixed results from clinical research. A meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies in adults undergoing surgery with general anesthesia shows that administering IV magnesium sulfate intraoperatively reduces PONV ( 114676 ). However, a meta-analysis of 20 clinical studies in adults undergoing surgery with general anesthesia shows that administering IV magnesium perioperatively does not reduce the incidence of PONV ( 114678 ). A moderate-sized clinical study conducted in China in older adults undergoing total knee arthroplasty shows that administering intravenous magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg prior to anesthesia induction then 15 mg/kg during surgery reduces the incidence of postoperative vomiting but not postoperative nausea when compared with control ( 113677 ). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be explained by differences in magnesium regimens, anesthesia protocols, and surgical populations studied. more Postoperative recovery. It is unclear if intravenous (IV) magnesium is beneficial for postoperative recovery. A moderate-sized clinical study conducted in China in older adults undergoing total knee arthroplasty shows that administering IV magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg prior to anesthesia induction then 15 mg/kg during surgery does not reduce extubation time, time spent in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), or duration of hospital stay when compared with control ( 113677 ). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 3 different clinical studies in adults undergoing surgery with general anesthesia shows that administering IV magnesium intraoperatively does not reduce extubation time ( 114676 ). more Postoperative sleep disturbance. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for postoperative sleep disturbances. Preliminary clinical research in adults undergoing open heart surgery shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg orally twice daily during hospitalization moderately improves sleep scores when compared with no magnesium therapy. Magnesium therapy was held for the 2 days immediately following surgery ( 110054 ). more Postoperative sore throat. It is unclear if topical magnesium sulfate is beneficial for preventing or treating sore throat pain after endotracheal intubation. Preliminary clinical research in patients undergoing endotracheal intubation for surgery shows that using a gargle containing magnesium sulfate 20% with lidocaine, 20 minutes before anesthesia induction, is less effective for reducing sore throat pain than a gargle containing dexmedetomidine and lidocaine ( 112779 ). The study did not include a comparison to lidocaine alone. Different preparations of magnesium have also been compared. A single-center clinical study in China in adults undergoing endotracheal intubation for elective surgery shows that applying a magnesium sulfate spray 15 mg/kg during intubation onto the pharyngeal area is non-inferior to a magnesium sulfate gargle 20 mg/kg used for 30 seconds 15 minutes prior to surgery in reducing the incidence of postoperative sore throat within 48 hours ( 116618 ). more Pregnancy-related leg cramps. It is unclear if oral magnesium reduces leg cramps during pregnancy; evidence is conflicting. One small clinical study in patients with pregnancy-related leg cramps shows that taking magnesium bisglycinate chelate 300 mg daily for 4 weeks reduces the frequency and intensity of leg cramps when compared with placebo ( 99318 ). A smaller clinical study in this population shows that taking a specific mixture of magnesium lactate and citrate (Nycoplus Magnesium) providing elemental magnesium 120 mg in the morning and 240 mg in the evening for 3 weeks reduces the frequency of cramps when compared with placebo ( 1194 ). However, not all research agrees. One small clinical study using this same supplement and dose for 2 weeks found no benefit when compared with placebo ( 17463 ). It is possible that a 2-week duration of treatment is too short to be beneficial. Finally, a meta-analysis of these studies and one other more recent clinical study shows that taking magnesium does not reduce the frequency or improve the resolution of pregnancy-related leg cramps when compared with placebo ( 105916 ). This analysis may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between treatment groups. more Pre-procedural sedation. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium is beneficial when administered in addition to other medications used for sedation during surgery. A moderate-sized study of adults aged 65-79 years old undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) shows that administering a single intravenous bolus of magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg prior to the procedure reduces intraoperative propofol requirements by about 21% and reduces some peri-procedural adverse events including the incidence of respiratory depression and involuntary movement when compared with control. However, there were no differences in recovery time, hemodynamic parameters, or the incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, perioperative nausea or vomiting, lethargy, or arrythmias ( 111694 ). Another moderate-sized study in older adults undergoing total knee arthroplasty shows that administering intravenous magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg prior to anesthesia induction then 15 mg/kg during surgery does not reduce the need for medications used for anesthesia induction, intraoperative maintenance propofol requirements, or recovery time when compared with control. However, magnesium sulfate does seem to reduce the amount of remifentanil required for intraoperative anesthesia maintenance and increase norepinephrine requirements when compared with control ( 113677 ). more Preterm labor. The use of magnesium sulfate to inhibit uterine contractions in preterm labor (tocolysis) is controversial. However, its use for the purpose of fetal neuroprotection for up to 48 hours is supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. Magnesium is given intravenously (IV) during preterm labor in an effort to improve fetal neurological outcomes, such as to reduce the risk of cerebral palsy and motor dysfunction in the infant ( 60915 , 60927 , 60931 , 61001 , 97485 , 103734 , 103754 , 114681 ). The typical dosage of magnesium sulfate is 4 grams infused IV over 10-30 minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion of 1-4 grams/hour for 48 hours or until birth. Use beyond 5-7 days has been associated with hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the fetus ( 15 , 12590 , 12594 ). Some meta-analyses of clinical research suggest that magnesium sulfate is more effective at delaying delivery by 48 hours when compared with oxytocin receptor blockers, nitrates, beta-mimetics, and/or placebo ( 20263 , 61021 ). However, an additional meta-analysis of several clinical studies shows that magnesium sulfate 4 or 6 grams IV is not more effective at delaying preterm labor by 48 hours when compared with nifedipine ( 115639 ). The reason for these discrepant findings are unclear, but may be related to the heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including dose and duration. more Restless legs syndrome (RLS). It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for RLS. Some observational research has found that hypomagnesemia is associated with RLS; however, not all research agrees ( 8096 , 9472 ). Preliminary clinical research in adults with RLS who are beginning treatment with pramipexole shows that also taking magnesium oxide 250 mg orally daily for 2 months moderately improves RLS scores and sleep quality scores when compared with pramipexole and placebo ( 110052 ). Other low-quality clinical research in adults with RLS or periodic limb movement during sleep shows that taking magnesium 12.4 mmol orally in the evening for 4-6 weeks decreases movement and increases sleep when compared with baseline ( 9466 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Sarcopenia. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of sarcopenia. Population research in older adults has found that lower dietary intake of magnesium is associated with sarcopenia. However, the effect of magnesium supplementation on sarcopenia prevention or treatment has not been evaluated ( 110055 ). Magnesium has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for treatment of sarcopenia. A small clinical study in elderly individuals with sarcopenia undergoing a diet and exercise program shows that taking a combination supplement containing magnesium 300 mg, carnosine, hydroxymethylbutyrate, lactoferrin, and sodium butyrate daily for 4 months increases muscle mass, as measured by the skeletal muscle index, and improves measures of muscle function, including handgrip muscle strength, chair test, and walking speed, when compared with placebo ( 114682 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to magnesium, other ingredients, or the combination. more Sepsis. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium is beneficial for sepsis. A very large observational study in patients with sepsis and hypomagnesaemia or normomagnesemia in the intensive care unit (ICU) suggests that administering intravenous magnesium sulfate 2 or 4 grams within 24 hours of admission reduces 28-day all-cause mortality from 25% in patients who did not use magnesium sulfate to 20% in those who were administered magnesium sulfate, regardless of baseline serum magnesium level and other baseline characteristics. Administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate in this population may also reduce ICU mortality by 4%, in-hospital mortality by 3%, and the use of renal replacement therapy by 3% but also seems to increase the length of ICU and hospital stay when compared with patients who did not use magnesium sulfate ( 113676 ). The validity of these results is limited by the observational nature of the study. more Sleep deprivation. Oral magnesium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A very small clinical study in sleep-deprived recreational athletes shows that taking a combination of magnesium 1350 mg, zinc 90 mg, and vitamin B6 31.5 mg for 3 nights at bedtime does not change sleep quality, subjective sleepiness, mood, or fatigue the next day when compared with placebo ( 113655 ). more Stroke. Increased dietary magnesium may decrease stroke risk, and using a magnesium-containing salt substitute may improve neurological performance post-stroke. However, intravenous magnesium has not demonstrated benefit. Most population research has found that increased dietary intake of magnesium is associated with decreased stroke risk and decreased mortality from stroke ( 9001 , 9002 , 90013 , 90030 , 90036 , 92107 , 103736 ). In patients who have had a stroke, a preliminary clinical study shows that using a salt substitute providing the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) of magnesium and potassium for 6 months improves neurological performance when compared with using regular salt ( 97491 ). However, intravenous (IV) magnesium does not seem to be beneficial in patients who have had a stroke. Large prospective clinical trials show that IV magnesium given within 12 hours of acute stroke does not reduce mortality or disability in most patients when compared with placebo. However, one subgroup analysis suggested that IV magnesium might benefit patients with lacunar (non-cortical) stroke ( 13361 , 90021 ). IV magnesium also doesn't seem to reduce cardiovascular complications after acute stroke. A secondary analysis of a clinical trial in patients after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke shows that giving IV magnesium does not reduce serious cardiac adverse events when compared with placebo ( 104393 ). Another secondary analysis of this trial shows that giving IV magnesium prior to arrival at the hospital and within 2 hours of a hemorrhagic stroke does not reduce hematoma volume on hospital arrival, hematoma expansion during hospital admission, or functional outcomes at 3 months ( 108733 ). more Subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intravenous magnesium sulfate may reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in people with subarachnoid hemorrhage, but evidence is conflicting. There is mixed evidence regarding the effect of magnesium sulfate in managing aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. One meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intravenous magnesium sulfate 64-144 mmol/day for 10-18 days reduces the risk of poor outcomes following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, including death, vegetative state, or dependency, by 46% when compared with control ( 60932 ). Also, meta-analyses of clinical research show that intravenous magnesium reduces the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia by 27% when compared with placebo ( 60944 , 89398 ). However, these results were not confirmed in other meta-analyses ( 60973 , 90034 ). more Thrombocytopenia. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium sulfate is beneficial in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Addition of intravenous magnesium sulfate as a 6-gram loading dose followed by 6 grams infused over 24 hours for 3 days, to standard treatment for TTP does not reduce the time to normalization of the platelet count, the incidence of TTP-related organ dysfunction, or the recurrence rate, when compared with standard treatment alone ( 112777 ). This study may have been underpowered to detect a difference. more Urinary incontinence. Although there has been interest in using oral magnesium for urinary incontinence, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of magnesium for this purpose. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) . It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for PXE. Preliminary clinical research in patients with PXE shows that taking magnesium oxide 800 mg (500 mg of elemental magnesium) twice daily for one year tends to reduce calcification of elastic skin fibers when compared with placebo, but the effect is not statistically significant ( 101393 ). This study was limited by small size and insufficient power to detect smaller effects. more More evidence is needed to rate magnesium for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Oral magnesium is safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 350 mg daily ( 7555 ). ...when used parenterally and appropriately. Parenteral magnesium sulfate is an FDA-approved prescription product ( 96484 ). Possibly Unsafe when used orally in excessive doses. Doses greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 350 mg daily frequently cause loose stools and diarrhea ( 7555 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Magnesium is safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 65 mg daily for children 1 to 3 years, 110 mg daily for children 4 to 8 years, and 350 mg daily for children older than 8 years ( 7555 , 89396 ). ...when used parenterally and appropriately ( 96483 ). CHILDREN: Likely Unsafe when used orally in excessive doses. Tell patients not to use doses above the tolerable upper intake level (UL). Higher doses can cause diarrhea and symptomatic hypermagnesemia including hypotension, nausea, vomiting, and bradycardia ( 7555 , 8095 ). PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Magnesium is safe for those pregnant and breast-feeding when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 350 mg daily ( 7555 ). PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Possibly Safe when prescription magnesium sulfate is given intramuscularly and intravenously prior to delivery for up to 5 days ( 12592 , 89397 , 99354 , 99355 ). However, due to potential adverse effects associated with intravenous and intramuscular magnesium, use during pregnancy is limited to patients with specific conditions such as severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. There is some evidence that intravenous magnesium can increase fetal mortality and adversely affect neurological and skeletal development ( 12590 , 12593 , 60818 , 99354 , 99355 ). However, a more recent analysis of clinical research shows that increased risk of fetal mortality seems to occur only in the studies where antenatal magnesium is used for tocolysis and not for fetal neuroprotection or pre-eclampsia/eclampsia ( 102457 ). Furthermore, antenatal magnesium does not seem to be associated with increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants ( 104396 ). There is also concern that magnesium increases the risk of maternal adverse events. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that magnesium sulfate might increase the risk of maternal adverse events, especially in Hispanic mothers compared to other racial and ethnic groups ( 60971 , 99319 ). PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in excessive doses. Tell patients to avoid exceeding the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 350 mg daily. Taking magnesium orally in higher doses can cause diarrhea ( 7555 ). ...when prescription magnesium sulfate is given intramuscularly and intravenously prior to delivery for longer than 5 days ( 12592 , 89397 , 99354 , 99355 ). Maternal exposure to magnesium for longer than 5-7 days is associated with an increase in neonatal bone abnormalities such as osteopenia and fractures. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that magnesium injection not be given for longer than 5-7 days ( 12590 , 12593 , 60818 , 99354 , 99355 ).</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: General : For preventing deficiency, the daily Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for elemental magnesium should be followed. For males: 400 mg for ages 19-30 years, 420 mg for ages 31 years and older. For females: 310 mg for ages 19-30 years, and 320 mg for ages 31 years and older. For pregnant females: 400 mg for ages 14-18 years, 350 mg for ages 19-30 years, and 360 mg for ages 31-50 years. For lactating females: 360 mg for ages 14-18 years, 310 mg for ages 19-30 years, 320 mg for ages 31-50 years ( 7555 ). Therapeutic doses of magnesium vary widely. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Intravenous / Intramuscular:Magnesium sulfate is typically used intravenously, short-term for acute management of symptoms. Typical loading doses range from 4-14 grams IV, and can be followed by 2.5-5 grams every 4 hours IM, or a continuous IV infusion of 0.5-3 grams/hour. Children Oral: For preventing deficiency, the daily Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for elemental magnesium should be followed. For all children: 80 mg for ages 1-3 years, 130 mg for ages 4-8 years, 240 mg for ages 9-13 years. For males: 410 mg for ages 14-18 years. For females: 360 mg for ages 14-18 years. For pregnant females age 14-18 years, 400 mg; for lactating females age 14-18 years, 360 mg. For infants 0-6 months of age, the adequate intake (AI) level is 30 mg. For infants 7-12 months of age, the AI is 75 mg. For therapeutic uses, research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Standardization &amp; Formulation Magnesium supplements used varied in composition, by the particular salt used in the formulation (aspartate, oxide, pidolate, and orotate) or by other confounding ingredients (multi-vitamin as magnesium source) ( 60751 ). Other salts of magnesium include citrate, chloride, lactate citrate, and gluconate. Supplement manufacturers of magnesium/calcium combination products promote a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio as being ideal for absorption of these elements. However, there is no credible research to support this claim. Products such as coral calcium that claim to have ideal combinations of magnesium and calcium to cure a variety of diseases and conditions have come under scrutiny of the FDA and FTC ( 12508 ).</data><data key="interactions_text">Expand All | Collapse All AMINOGLYCOSIDE ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Concomitant use of aminoglycoside antibiotics and magnesium can increase the risk for neuromuscular weakness. Both aminoglycosides and magnesium reduce presynaptic acetylcholine release, which can lead to neuromuscular blockade and possible paralysis. This is most likely to occur with high doses of magnesium given intravenously ( 13362 ). more ANTACIDS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Use of acid reducers may reduce the laxative effect of magnesium oxide. A retrospective analysis shows that, in the presence of H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), a higher dose of magnesium oxide is needed for a laxative effect ( 90033 ). This may also occur with antacids. Under acidic conditions, magnesium oxide is converted to magnesium chloride and then to magnesium bicarbonate, which has an osmotic laxative effect. By reducing acidity, antacids may reduce the conversion of magnesium oxide to the active bicarbonate salt. more ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, magnesium may have antiplatelet effects, but the evidence is conflicting. In vitro evidence shows that magnesium sulfate inhibits platelet aggregation, even at low concentrations ( 20304 , 20305 ). Some preliminary clinical evidence shows that infusion of magnesium sulfate increases bleeding time by 48% and reduces platelet activity ( 20306 ). However, other clinical research shows that magnesium does not affect platelet aggregation, although inhibition of platelet-dependent thrombosis can occur ( 60759 ). more BICTEGRAVIR/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE (Biktarvy) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Magnesium might decrease levels of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide by reducing its absorption. Advise patients that bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide should be taken at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after magnesium containing products ( 116930 ). more BISPHOSPHONATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonquantitative systematic review) Magnesium can decrease absorption of bisphosphonates. Cations, including magnesium, can decrease bisphosphonate absorption. Advise patients to separate doses of magnesium and these drugs by at least 2 hours ( 13363 ). more CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Magnesium can have additive effects with calcium channel blockers, although evidence is conflicting. Magnesium inhibits calcium entry into smooth muscle cells and may therefore have additive effects with calcium channel blockers. Severe hypotension and neuromuscular blockades may occur when nifedipine is used with intravenous magnesium ( 3046 , 20264 , 20265 , 20266 ), although some contradictory evidence suggests that concurrent use of magnesium with nifedipine does not increase the risk of neuromuscular weakness ( 60831 ). High doses of magnesium could theoretically have additive effects with other calcium channel blockers. more DIGOXIN Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Magnesium salts may reduce absorption of digoxin. Clinical evidence suggests that treatment with oral magnesium hydroxide or magnesium trisilicate reduces absorption of digoxin from the intestines ( 198 , 20268 , 20270 ). This may reduce the blood levels of digoxin and decrease its therapeutic effects. more GABAPENTIN (Neurontin) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Gabapentin absorption can be decreased by magnesium. Clinical research shows that giving magnesium oxide orally along with gabapentin decreases the maximum plasma concentration of gabapentin by 33%, time to maximum concentration by 36%, and area under the curve by 43% ( 90032 ). Advise patients to take gabapentin at least 2 hours before, or 4 to 6 hours after, magnesium supplements. more KETAMINE (Ketalar) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Magnesium might precipitate ketamine toxicity. In one case report, a 62-year-old hospice patient with terminal cancer who had been stabilized on sublingual ketamine 150 mg four times daily experienced severe ketamine toxicity lasting for 2 hours after taking a maintenance dose of ketamine following an infusion of magnesium sulfate 2 grams ( 105078 ). Since both magnesium and ketamine block the NMDA receptor, magnesium is thought to have potentiated the effects of ketamine. more LEVODOPA/CARBIDOPA (Sinemet) Interaction Rating Major Do not take this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Magnesium can reduce the bioavailability of levodopa/carbidopa. Clinical research in healthy volunteers shows that taking magnesium oxide 1000 mg with levodopa 100 mg/carbidopa 10 mg reduces the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by 35% and of carbidopa by 81%. In vitro and animal research shows that magnesium produces an alkaline environment in the digestive tract, which might lead to degradation and reduced bioavailability of levodopa/carbidopa ( 100265 ). more POTASSIUM-SPARING DIURETICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Potassium-sparing diuretics decrease excretion of magnesium, possibly increasing magnesium levels. Potassium-sparing diuretics also have magnesium-sparing properties, which can counteract the magnesium losses associated with loop and thiazide diuretics ( 9613 , 9614 , 9622 ). Theoretically, increased magnesium levels could result from concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics and magnesium supplements. more QUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Magnesium decreases absorption of quinolones. Magnesium can form insoluble complexes with quinolones and decrease their absorption ( 3046 ). Advise patients to take these drugs at least 2 hours before, or 4 to 6 hours after, magnesium supplements. more SEVELAMER (Renagel, Renvela) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Clinical cohort study) Sevelamer may increase serum magnesium levels. In patients on hemodialysis, sevelamer use was associated with a 0.28 mg/dL increase in serum magnesium. The mechanism of this interaction remains unclear ( 96486 ). more SKELETAL MUSCLE RELAXANTS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence A (High-quality meta-analysis (quantitative systematic review)) Parenteral magnesium alters the pharmacokinetics of skeletal muscle relaxants, increasing their effects and accelerating the onset of effect. Parenteral magnesium shortens the time to onset of skeletal muscle relaxants by about 1 minute and prolongs the duration of action by about 2 minutes. Magnesium potentiates the effects of skeletal muscle relaxants by decreasing calcium-mediated release of acetylcholine from presynaptic nerve terminals, reducing postsynaptic sensitivity to acetylcholine, and having a direct effect on the membrane potential of myocytes ( 3046 , 97492 , 107364 ). Magnesium also has vasodilatory actions and increases cardiac output, allowing a greater amount of muscle relaxant to reach the motor end plate ( 107364 ). A clinical study found that low-dose rocuronium (0.45 mg/kg), when given after administration of magnesium 30 mg/kg over 10 minutes, has an accelerated onset of effect, which matches the onset of effect seen with a full-dose rocuronium regimen (0.6 mg/kg) ( 96485 ). In another clinical study, onset times for rocuronium doses of 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 mg/kg were 86, 76, and 50 seconds, respectively, when given alone, but were reduced to 66, 44, and 38 seconds, respectively, when the doses were given after a 15-minute infusion of magnesium sulfate 60 mg/kg ( 107364 ). Giving intraoperative intravenous magnesium sulfate, 50 mg/kg loading dose followed by 15 mg/kg/hour, reduces the onset time of rocuronium, enhances its clinical effects, reduces the dose of intraoperative opiates, and prolongs the spontaneous recovery time ( 112781 , 112782 ). It does not affect the activity of subsequently administered neostigmine ( 112782 ). more SULFONYLUREAS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Magnesium increases the systemic absorption of sulfonylureas, increasing their effects and side effects. Clinical research shows that administration of magnesium hydroxide with glyburide increases glyburide absorption, increases maximal insulin response by 35-fold, and increases the risk of hypoglycemia, when compared with glyburide alone ( 20307 ). A similar interaction occurs between magnesium hydroxide and glipizide ( 20308 ). The mechanism of this effect appears to be related to the elevation of gastrointestinal pH by magnesium-based antacids, increasing solubility and enhancing absorption of sulfonylureas ( 22364 ). more TETRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Magnesium decreases absorption of tetracyclines.

Milk thistle extracts are typically standardized to silymarin content, with concentrations ranging from 70% to 80% ( 2613 , 2614 , 2618 , 17228 , 63210 , 63260 , 63263 , 63278 , 63280 , 63299 )( 63317 , 63339 , 63340 , 88154 ). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Topical: Milk thistle has been used in various topical formulations, including gels and creams. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Children Oral: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Standardization &amp; Formulation Milk thistle extract is often standardized to silymarin content. Silymarin is a complex mixture of flavonolignans, with the six present in the highest quantities being silybin A, silybin B, isosilybin A, isosilybin B, silidianin, and silychristin ( 63240 , 63249 , 88157 , 95021 , 95022 ). The precise percentage of silymarin measured in a milk thistle preparation depends on how many of these flavonolignans are identified by the method used ( 63240 , 63249 ). Silymarin is not the same as silibinin. Silibinin is a semi purified extract that is roughly a 1:1 mixture of silybin A and silybin B ( 95026 ). One specific milk thistle extract (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) is standardized to contain 70% to 80% silymarin ( 63212 , 88157 ). Each capsule contains 175 mg of dried milk thistle seed extract, equivalent to 140 mg of silymarin ( 95026 , 101150 ). Another product containing milk thistle extract (BIO-C, Milte Italia S.r.l.) 420 mg is standardized to 60% silymarin. The silymarin in this product is micronized to improve oral bioavailability ( 95027 ). Another product containing milk thistle extract (Livergol, Goldaru Herbal Products Pharmaceutical Company) is standardized to at least 80% silymarin and 30% silybins. Each tablet provides 140 mg silymarin ( 97626 ). One specific combination product containing tree turmeric and milk thistle extract (Berberol, PharmExtracta) is standardized to contain 60% to 80% silybin from milk thistle extract and 85% berberine from tree turmeric ( 95019 , 96140 , 96141 , 96142 , 97624 , 101158 ). The same product with added monacolins (Berberol K, PharmExtracta) has also been used ( 97625 ). An analysis of milk thistle preparations available in the US and Czech Republic shows that there is a large variability in the manufacturer-recommended dose. Also, there are issues with standardization of milk thistle products to silymarin. Analysis shows that the total concentration of silymarin in the products was 35% to 125% of declared silymarin content, possibly due to the lack of a strict definition for silymarin. Also, there was variability in the specific flavonoid and flavonolignan composition of individual products ( 101157 ). There was evidence of fungal mycotoxin contamination in 100% of the products tested, with most products having more than one mycotoxin. Some mycotoxins exceeded EU recommendations by 19 times the maximal limits in 92% of products. Furthermore, some products contained measurable levels of pesticides and evidence of bacterial contamination ( 101157 ).</data><data key="interactions_text">Expand All | Collapse All ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Taking milk thistle with antidiabetes drugs may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Clinical research shows that milk thistle extract, alone or along with tree turmeric extract, can lower blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes, including those already taking antidiabetes drugs ( 15102 , 63190 , 63314 , 63318 , 95019 , 96140 , 96141 , 97624 , 97626 , 113987 ). Additionally, animal research shows that milk thistle extract increases the metformin maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve and decreases the renal clearance of metformin, due to inhibition of the multi-drug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1) renal tubular transport protein ( 114919 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, milk thistle might inhibit CYP2B6. An in vitro study shows that silybin, a constituent of milk thistle, binds to and noncompetitively inhibits CYP2B6. Additionally, silybin might downregulate the expression of CYP2B6 by decreasing mRNA and protein levels ( 112229 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) It is unclear if milk thistle inhibits CYP2C9; research is conflicting. In vitro research suggests that milk thistle might inhibit CYP2C9 ( 7089 , 17973 , 17976 ). Additionally, 3 case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describe increased toxicity in patients taking milk thistle and cancer medications that are CYP2C9 substrates, including imatinib and capecitabine ( 111644 ). However, contradictory clinical research shows that milk thistle extract does not inhibit CYP2C9 or significantly affect levels of the CYP2C9 substrate tolbutamide ( 13712 , 95026 ). Differences in results could be due to differences in dosages or formulations utilized ( 95026 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) It is unclear if milk thistle inhibits CYP3A4; research is conflicting. While laboratory research shows conflicting results ( 7318 , 17973 , 17975 , 17976 ), pharmacokinetic research shows that taking milk thistle extract 420-1350 mg daily does not significantly affect the metabolism of the CYP3A4 substrates irinotecan, midazolam, or indinavir ( 8234 , 17974 , 93578 , 95026 ). However, 8 case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describe increased toxicity in patients taking milk thistle and cancer medications that are CYP3A4 substrates, including gefitinib, sorafenib, doxorubicin, and vincristine ( 111644 ). more ESTROGENS Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, milk thistle might interfere with estrogen therapy through competition for estrogen receptors. Animal research suggests that a milk thistle extract of silymarin binds to estrogen receptor beta ( 93025 , 93026 ). more GLUCURONIDATED DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, milk thistle might affect the clearance of drugs that undergo glucuronidation. Laboratory research shows that milk thistle constituents inhibit uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT), the major phase 2 enzyme that is responsible for glucuronidation ( 7318 , 17973 ). Theoretically, this could decrease the clearance and increase levels of glucuronidated drugs. Other laboratory research suggests that a milk thistle extract of silymarin might inhibit beta-glucuronidase ( 7354 ), although the significance of this effect is unclear. more HMG-CoA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS ("Statins") Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, milk thistle might interfere with statin therapy by decreasing the activity of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATB1B1) and inhibiting breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Preliminary evidence suggests that a milk thistle extract of silymarin can decrease the activity of the OATP1B1, which transports HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors into the liver to their site of action, and animal research shows this increases the maximum plasma concentration of pitavastatin and pravastatin ( 113975 ). The silibinin component also inhibits BCRP, which transports statins from the liver into the bile for excretion. However, in a preliminary study in healthy males, silymarin 140 mg three times daily had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 10 mg dose of rosuvastatin ( 16408 ). more INDINAVIR (Crixivan) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, milk thistle may induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzymes and increase the metabolism of indinavir; however, results are conflicting. One pharmacokinetic study shows that taking milk thistle (Standardized Milk Thistle, General Nutrition Corp.) 175 mg three times daily in combination with multiple doses of indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours decreases the mean trough levels of indinavir by 25% ( 8234 ). However, results from the same pharmacokinetic study show that milk thistle does not affect the overall exposure to indinavir ( 8234 ). Furthermore, two other pharmacokinetic studies show that taking specific milk thistle extract (Legalon, Rottapharm Madaus; Thisilyn, Nature's Way) 160-450 mg every 8 hours in combination with multiple doses of indinavir 800 mg every 8 hours does not reduce levels of indinavir ( 93578 ). more LEDIPASVIR Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, milk thistle might increase the levels and clinical effects of ledipasvir. Animal research in rats shows that milk thistle increases the area under the curve (AUC) for ledipasvir and slows its elimination ( 109505 ). more MORPHINE Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, concomitant use of milk thistle with morphine might affect serum levels of morphine and either increase or decrease its effects. Animal research shows that milk thistle reduces serum levels of morphine by up to 66% ( 101161 ). In contrast, laboratory research shows that milk thistle constituents inhibit uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT), the major phase 2 enzyme that is responsible for glucuronidation ( 7318 , 17973 ). Theoretically, this could decrease the clearance and increase morphine levels. The effect of taking milk thistle on morphine metabolism in humans is not known. more ORGANIC ANION-TRANSPORTING POLYPEPTIDE SUBSTRATES (OATP) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Milk thistle may inhibit one form of OATP, OATP-B1, which could reduce the bioavailability and clinical effects of OATP-B1 substrates. In vitro research shows that milk thistle inhibits OATP-B1. Two case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describe increased toxicity in patients taking milk thistle and cancer medications that are OATP substrates, including sorafenib and methotrexate ( 111644 ). OATPs are expressed in the small intestine and liver and are responsible for the uptake of drugs and other compounds into the body. Inhibition of OATP may reduce the bioavailability of oral drugs that are substrates of OATP. more P-GLYCOPROTEIN SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, milk thistle might increase the absorption of P-glycoprotein substrates. However, this effect does not seem to be clinically significant. In vitro research shows that milk thistle can inhibit P-glycoprotein activity ( 95019 , 111644 ) and 1 case report from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describes increased abdominal pain in a patient taking milk thistle and the cancer medication vincristine, a P-glycoprotein substrate, though this patient was also taking methotrexate ( 111644 ). However, a small pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers shows that taking milk thistle (Enzymatic Therapy Inc.) 900 mg, standardized to 80% silymarin, in 3 divided doses daily for 14 days does not affect absorption of digoxin, a P-glycoprotein substrate ( 35825 ). more RALOXIFENE (Evista) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, milk thistle might decrease the clearance and increase levels of raloxifene. Laboratory research suggests that the milk thistle constituents silibinin and silymarin inhibit the glucuronidation of raloxifene in the intestines ( 93024 ). more SIROLIMUS (Rapamune) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Clinical cohort study) Milk thistle might decrease the clearance of sirolimus. Pharmacokinetic research shows that a milk thistle extract of silymarin decreases the apparent clearance of sirolimus in hepatically impaired renal transplant patients ( 19876 ). It is unclear if this interaction occurs in patients without hepatic impairment. more SOFOSBUVIR (Solvaldi) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, milk thistle might decrease the levels and clinical effects of sofosbuvir. Animal research in rats shows that milk thistle reduces the metabolism of sofosbuvir, as well as the hepatic uptake of its active metabolite ( 109505 ). more TAMOXIFEN (Nolvadex) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, the milk thistle constituent silibinin might increase tamoxifen levels and interfere with its conversion to an active metabolite. Animal research suggests that the milk thistle constituent silibinin might increase plasma levels of tamoxifen and alter its conversion to an active metabolite. The mechanism appears to involve inhibition of pre-systemic metabolism of tamoxifen by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and CYP3A4, and inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of tamoxifen into the intestine for excretion ( 17101 ). Whether this interaction occurs in humans is not known. more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, milk thistle might increase the effects of warfarin. In one case report, a man stabilized on warfarin experienced an increase in INR from 2.64 to 4.12 after taking a combination product containing milk thistle 200 mg daily, as well as dandelion, wild yam, niacinamide, and vitamin B12. Levels returned to normal after stopping the supplement ( 101159 ). Although a direct correlation between milk thistle and the change in INR cannot be confirmed, some in vitro research suggests that milk thistle might inhibit cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of various drugs, including warfarin ( 7089 , 17973 , 17976 ). more</data><data key="mechanism_text">General The applicable parts of milk thistle are the seed and above ground parts. The seed is most commonly used medicinally. A standard milk thistle seed extract contains 70% to 80% silymarin, which is a mixture of flavonolignans including silybin A, silybin B, isosilybin A, isosilybin B, silydianin, silychristin A and B, and silibinin ( 63240 , 63249 , 95024 , 95025 , 101157 , 114908 ). Silybin or silibinin is thought to be the most active component of silymarin ( 95021 , 95022 , 95025 ). Other constituents, including dehydrosilybin, desoxy-silydianin, silybinomer, and taxifolin, have also been isolated ( 63249 , 114908 ). Anti-addictive effects In vitro, milk thistle extract was able to bind to the mu-opioid receptor, the receptor involved in most of the effects of morphine ( 101161 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Silibinin decreases the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) via down-modulation of nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) ( 63252 ). Silymarin also regulates inflammatory mediators, downregulates the synthesis of prostaglandin and leukotrienes as well as inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) II ( 95028 ). In laboratory research, a similar inhibition of NF-kappa B and IFN-B-dependent transcription has been seen in Huh7 cells in the presence of silibinin ( 63233 ). Silymarin is an inhibitor of inflammation mediated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), possibly by an effect on intracellular signaling ( 7859 ). A meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies in healthy adults and adults with various medical conditions shows that taking milk thistle reduces interleukin 6 (IL-6) when compared with placebo or control ( 113981 ). However, preliminary clinical research in adults with stable rheumatoid arthritis (RA) shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 140 mg orally three times daily for 3 months does not lower proinflammatory cytokine levels, including TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, when compared to baseline ( 110487 ). Similarly, clinical research in adults with RA shows that taking milk thistle extract 300 mg daily for 8 weeks does not lower C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( 114915 ). Meta-analyses evaluating the impact of milk thistle on CRP levels in healthy adults and adults with various medical conditions show mixed results ( 113981 , 113987 ). Anticancer effects In human leukocytes, silymarin protects against DNA damage caused by hydrogen peroxide, and in a mouse skin model it reduces UVB and chemically induced carcinogenesis. These effects may be attributable to the antioxidant properties of silymarin ( 63204 , 63298 , 63312 ). Chemically induced tumor promotion in rats can be prevented by silymarin, possibly via inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha ( 63300 ). Silymarin inhibits mitogenic signaling pathways involved in proliferation of androgen-independent and androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells ( 7319 , 63148 ). Silybin A and silybin B, constituents of milk thistle, inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis of K562 leukemia cells ( 63243 ), MCF7 human breast cancer cells, and T47D human breast carcinoma cells, via a purported mitochondrial and caspase-8 mediated pathway ( 63232 ). In vitro, silibinin has shown an affinity for binding to p-glycoprotein, a transporter thought to be involved in the drug resistance of cancer cells ( 11481 ). Antidiabetic effects Silymarin seems to decrease insulin resistance and have a protective effect on the pancreas in rats with experimentally induced diabetes mellitus ( 63309 ). This is thought to be due to silymarin's antioxidant effects. Some research suggests that oxidative stress can contribute to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, reduced insulin secretion, and insulin resistance ( 15102 ). Laboratory research suggests that silibinin reduces glycolysis from carbohydrates in a dose-dependent manner, via inhibition of pyruvate kinase activity, affecting oxidative phosphorylation, and reducing formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation ( 63197 ). Additionally, there is interest in using silymarin for complications of diabetes, such as diabetic nephropathy, which is thought to be caused by oxidative stress and inflammation ( 95028 ). Silymarin also possesses anti-fibrotic properties via downregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). TGF-beta plays a role in diabetic nephropathy as it causes hardening of the glomerulus in the kidney as well as interstitial fibrosis. Antilipemic effects Early animal experimentation with silybin demonstrated decreased cholesterol synthesis ( 63270 ) and reduced biliary excretion of cholesterol salts by 60% to 70%, while leaving biliary flow rates unchanged ( 63211 ). In perfused livers from rats fed a high-cholesterol diet, silymarin normalized the clearance of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), providing significant protection against dietary-induced hypercholesterolemia ( 63310 ). In laboratory research, silymarin and silibinin inhibited the generation of oxidized LDL, likely through antioxidant and free radical scavenging mechanisms of action ( 63200 ). Milk thistle may inhibit cholesterol acyltransferase, which leads to a reduction of cholesterol absorption and lipoprotein biosynthesis. Milk thistle has also been shown to decrease myeloperoxidase (MPO) in patients with hyperlipidemia; MPO is a marker of cardiovascular risk ( 95019 ). Milk thistle, or silymarin, inhibits HMG-CoA reductase ( 95028 ). It also decreases very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis and the amount of free VLDL that can be secreted into the intestine. By downregulating certain factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma), it decreases lipid accumulation. In human research, silymarin has been shown to lower levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol ( 15102 , 49769 , 51423 , 63229 , 113987 ), although some conflicting research exists ( 105792 ). Antioxidant effects Silybin reduces lipid peroxidation in various types of cell cultures and in a rat model ( 63150 , 63185 , 63294 , 63296 , 63305 , 63308 ). It also prevents the depletion of glutathione and protects DNA from degradation ( 95028 ). Clinical research on the potential anti-oxidant effects of milk thistle is conflicting. A meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials shows that taking milk thistle increases serum glutathione (GSH) levels ( 113977 ), while another meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies shows no increase in GSH ( 113981 ). A meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials and an additional small clinical study do not indicate that taking milk thistle reduces malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, though 2 other meta-analyses of up to 9 clinical trials show that taking milk thistle does reduce MDA levels. Additionally, meta-analyses of up to 5 clinical trials show no effect of milk thistle on serum total antioxidant capacity ( 113977 , 113981 , 114913 ). There was significant heterogeneity in all analyses, which may be explained by variations in the studies that were pooled, including differences in the health conditions, doses of milk thistle, and durations of treatment evaluated. Antiviral effects In cellular and human research, silibinin has been shown to reduce levels of hepatitis C viral (HCV)-RNA, inhibit the production of progeny HCV particles, and dose-dependently inhibit the fusion of HCV pseudoparticles and fluorescent liposomes ( 63225 , 63233 , 63236 ). Dermatologic effects There is interest in using milk thistle or silymarin for radiation induced mucositis. Mucositis is caused secondary to DNA damage from production of free radicals. This increases levels of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to tissue damage. Bacterial colonization then occurs, which leads to further damage and production of more inflammatory cytokines. Silymarin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory via inhibition of leukotrienes and prostaglandin formation, and immunomodulatory via increases in lymphocytes and suppression of T-cell activation ( 95021 ). There is interest in using milk thistle for chemotherapy-induced acral erythema (also known as hand-foot syndrome). This condition may be caused by a direct toxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents. It is possible that toxic metabolites of chemotherapeutic agents build up in the stratum corneum of the palms and soles. With increased pressure and temperature in these areas, inflammation occurs leading to oxidative damage and production of free radicals. Silymarin acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulator via suppression of T-cell activation and increasing lymphocyte proliferation. When applied topically, silymarin is thought to protect the cell membrane from damage and block the uptake of toxins ( 95022 ). Drug metabolizing enzyme effects In laboratory and animal research, silymarin and its flavonolignan, silibinin, inhibit cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), the major phase 1 hepatic enzymes ( 17101 ). However, milk thistle or silymarin does not seem to affect the metabolism of indinavir (Crixivan) or midazolam, CYP3A4 substrates, in healthy volunteers ( 10427 , 14420 , 95026 ). Milk thistle also does not seem to affect the metabolism of tolbutamide, a CYP2C9 substrate, in healthy volunteers ( 95026 ). This suggests that milk thistle is not a significant inhibitor of CYP3A4 or CYP2C9. Other research in healthy volunteers also suggests that milk thistle does not affect CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, or CYP3A5 ( 13712 , 95026 ). Laboratory research suggests that silymarin and silibinin also inhibit uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT), the major phase 2 enzyme that is responsible for glucuronidation ( 6450 , 7089 , 7318 ). They also inhibit the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), which transports drugs such as the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ("statins") into the liver ( 16408 ). Silibinin and silymarin also inhibit breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) which transports statins from the liver into the bile ( 16408 ). In laboratory and animal research, silibinin also inhibits P-glycoprotein which promotes efflux of drugs into the intestine for excretion ( 17101 , 95019 ). Gastrointestinal effects There is interest in using milk thistle or silymarin for ulcerative colitis (UC). UC involves an inflammatory process that is provoked by certain immune elements, microbes, and oxidative stress ( 95029 ). Silymarin possesses antioxidant properties and reduces inflammatory cytokines. Animal research suggests that treatment with silibinin, the major component of silymarin, and ursodeoxycholic acid inhibits nuclear factor (NF) kappa beta and is associated with a reduction in colitis. Hepatoprotective effects Antioxidant and free radical-scavenging actions of milk thistle constituents such as silymarin and silybin are thought to be important mechanisms for their hepatoprotective effects ( 63153 , 63204 , 63264 , 63272 , 63282 , 63289 , 63331 , 95024 ). Silymarin prevents hepatotoxicity of microcystin-LR (a toxin from the alga Microcystis aeruginosa) in rats and mice, possibly by preventing oxidation of protein-thiol groups ( 63207 ). In humans, superoxide dismutase levels in erythrocytes and lymphocytes are raised in the presence of silymarin ( 63262 ). Silymarin seems to alter outer hepatocyte cell membranes, stabilizing them and inhibiting binding and penetration of toxins such as alpha-amanitin from Amanita mushrooms ( 6879 , 63303 ). It is this stabilization that may also lead to a reduction of gamma-glutamyl transferase levels ( 96261 ). Silibinin can ameliorate alpha-amanitin-induced increases in lipid peroxidation ( 63222 ). In rats, silymarin protects the liver from D-galactosamine-induced toxicity by activating enzymes in the UDP-glucuronic acid biosynthesis pathways, which detoxify phenols and other substances ( 63279 ). Silymarin, silibinin and silybin stimulate DNA polymerase in hepatocytes, increasing ribosomal RNA and protein synthesis, which can stimulate liver cell regeneration ( 6879 , 63253 , 63258 , 63336 ). Silymarin and silibinin inhibit beta-glucuronidase, which is thought to reduce the hydrolysis of glucuronides into toxic metabolites in the liver and intestine ( 7354 ). A meta-analysis of 34 clinical trials shows that taking milk thistle reduces aspartate aminotransferase levels by 6.5 IU/L, alanine transaminase by 9.7 IU/L, and alkaline phosphatase by 15.4 IU/L when compared with control. However, there was no effect overall on gamma-glutamyl transferase or total bilirubin ( 113977 ). There was significant heterogeneity in all analyses, which may be explained by variations in the studies that were pooled, including differences in the health conditions, doses of milk thistle, and durations of treatment evaluated. Neuronal/CNS effects Milk thistle enhances nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC-12 neural cells and prolongs their survival in culture ( 63159 ). There is also evidence that milk thistle extract protects cultured rat hippocampal neurons against oxidative stress-induced cell death ( 63223 ). Psychiatric effects There is interest in using milk thistle or silymarin to treat obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The purported mechanisms behind its efficacy are three-fold. First, oxidative stress implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, including OCD, is thought to be ameliorated by silymarin, which possesses antioxidant effects and inhibits the formation of free radicals. Second, the disturbance of dopamine transmission associated with OCD may be prevented by silymarin, which appears to attenuate the loss of dopamine in the brain and improves deficits associated with dopaminergic hypofunction. Manipulation of dopamine may help to control behavior seen in OCD. Last, silymarin may inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity which leads to increased levels of dopamine in the brain, and improve executive function ( 95023 ). In clinical research, supplementation with milk thistle 150 mg to 300 mg twice daily for 8 weeks up to 4 months has led to symptomatic improvements in patients with trichotillomania (recurrent hair pulling), OCD related to contamination and washing obsessions, and nail biting ( 95023 ). Renal protective effects Several animal studies suggest that silymarin, silibinin, and silychristin can protect kidney cells from nephrotoxic drugs such as cyclosporine, cisplatin and ifosfamide ( 7320 , 63290 , 63295 , 63308 , 114919 ). Mechanisms may include prevention of lipid peroxidation ( 63308 ) and a regenerative effect on kidney cells, which is similar to the effects on hepatic cells ( 7320 ). Alternatively, laboratory and animal research suggests that silymarin has the potential to increase the risk of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity via inhibition of multi-drug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1) which may decrease the renal excretion of cisplatin and increase its accumulation in the kidney ( 114919 ). In clinical research, silymarin has not been more effective than placebo in preventing acute kidney injury secondary to cisplatin ( 95025 ). However, in other clinical research in patients taking vancomycin, silymarin reduced the risk of acute kidney injury ( 114909 ). A meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials shows that taking milk thistle reduces serum creatinine levels by 0.04 mg/dL but does not affect blood urea nitrogen levels when compared with placebo or control ( 113977 ). There was significant heterogeneity in all analyses, which may be explained by variations in the studies that were pooled, including differences in the health conditions, doses of milk thistle, and durations of treatment evaluated.</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Milk%20Thistle</data><data key="scientific_name">Silybum marianum (synonym: Carduus marianus)</data><data key="overview_text">Milk thistle is a plant native to Europe that was introduced into North America by early colonists.

Oral milk thistle extracts of silymarin seem to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes. A meta-analysis of 22 clinical studies in healthy adults and adults with diabetes or other medical conditions shows that taking milk thistle reduces fasting blood glucose by around 22 mg/dL, reduces glycated hemoglobin by 0.85%, and reduces fasting insulin by 3.8 mU/mL when compared with placebo or control ( 113987 ). The validity of this analysis is limited by heterogeneity between clinical trials, including population, background treatments, and outcomes. Most of these studies were conducted in the Middle East, so it is unclear whether these results are generalizable to other geographic locations. A meta-analysis of 7 small heterogeneous clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking milk thistle containing silymarin 210-600 mg alone or with other ingredients daily for up to 6 months reduces fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin when compared with control. Sub-group analyses suggest that studies conducted for less than 3 months seem to have a greater glycemic benefit than those lasting 3 months or longer. Furthermore, there was a greater glycemic benefit when milk thistle was used in combination with other natural ingredients ( 105054 ). Most studies in the analysis used silymarin in divided doses of 420-600 mg daily, while only one study used 200 mg daily ( 15102 , 63190 , 97626 , 105054 ). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 22 clinical studies in healthy adults and adults with diabetes or other medical conditions shows that taking milk thistle reduces fasting blood glucose by around 22 mg/dL, reduces glycated hemoglobin by 0.85%, and reduces fasting insulin by 3.8 mU/mL when compared with placebo or control ( 113987 ). The validity of this analysis is limited by heterogeneity between clinical trials, including population, background treatments, and outcomes. Most of these studies were conducted in the Middle East, so it is unclear whether these results are generalizable to other geographic locations. Most studies of combination products have been conducted in Italy and involve a specific product (Berberol, PharmExtracta) containing milk thistle standardized to silymarin 105-210 mg with tree turmeric standardized to berberine 500-1000 mg ( 96141 , 105054 ). In addition to improving glycemic indices in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 105054 ), this product has shown glycemic benefit in patients with concomitant obesity and metabolic syndrome ( 97624 ) and in patients with type 1 diabetes ( 96142 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acne. It is unclear if oral or topical milk thistle is beneficial in patients with acne when used alone or in combination with other treatments. A small clinical trial in patients with acne vulgaris shows that taking a milk thistle extract standardized to silymarin 140 mg daily for 2 months does not improve acne severity based on the Global Acne Grading system scale when compared with doxycycline 100 mg daily, and silymarin is less effective than doxycycline when evaluated using the Acne Severity Index (ASI) scale. In addition, using silymarin in combination with doxycycline does not appear to be more effective than doxycycline alone ( 101160 ). There is also interest in using milk thistle topically for acne. A small quasi-experimental study in adults with mild to moderate acne suggests that applying silymarin 1.4% cream twice daily for 3 months improves global acne scores and appearance of acne when compared to baseline, but not when compared with biweekly salicylic acid chemical peels ( 113143 ). However, the interpretation of these results is limited by the use of subjective outcomes. Similarly, observational research in patients aged 12-25 years with mild-to-moderate acne suggests that applying a specific cream (Cleanance Comedomed, Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmetique) containing milk thistle fruit extract 25% twice daily for 8-12 weeks as initial or add-on therapy is associated with moderate improvements in acne scores when compared to baseline ( 111175 ). The interpretation of these results is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Further, most patients were also prescribed other skincare products or treatments. Topical milk thistle has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small open-label study conducted in Korea in adults with acne vulgaris shows that applying a specific topical product (Silymarin CF, Skinceuticals) containing silymarin 0.5%, vitamin C 15%, salicylic acid 0.5% and ferulic acid 0.5%, twice daily for 3 months moderately improves acne scores when compared to baseline ( 110488 ). A similar open-label study conducted in Brazil in adults with acne shows that applying a serum with this same combination and concentration of ingredients once daily for 12 weeks improves investigator's global assessment of acne severity, global lesion count, inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, skin clarity, skin tone evenness, and overall skin appearance and reduces skin surface oil when compared to baseline. Additionally, an open-label study conducted in the US and Germany in adults with acne shows that applying this same serum daily for 4 weeks in addition to prescription topical acne medications reduces investigator-assessed erythema, dryness, and scaling when compared to baseline ( 113985 ). In the aforementioned studies, it is unclear if these effects are due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination. The validity of the studies is also limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Acute kidney injury (AKI). It is unclear if oral milk thistle extract reduces the incidence of vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury. A moderate-sized clinical study in hospitalized patients in Iran shows that taking a specific milk thistle extract (Livergol, Goldaru Herbal Products Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg three times daily for the duration of vancomycin treatment, ranging from 7 to 14 days, reduces the incidence of acute kidney injury, but not hospital length of stay or need for kidney replacement therapy, compared with placebo ( 114909 ). The validity of these results is limited by the use of a per-protocol analysis. more Alcohol-related liver disease. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with alcohol-related liver disease, as evidence is conflicting. Some preliminary research shows that taking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 420 mg orally daily for one month to 4 years improves some liver function tests ( 2613 , 2618 , 17228 , 63260 , 63339 ). Some studies also report improvements in liver histology and survival ( 2616 , 17228 , 63278 ). However, in other studies, taking a similar dose of the same product for 3 months to 2 years is not associated with any benefit over placebo ( 7321 , 7322 , 7355 , 63158 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research also shows that milk thistle extract does not reduce mortality or complications related to liver disease in patients with alcohol-related liver disease ( 63192 ). Reasons for the conflicting findings are unclear but might relate to the low methodological quality of many of these studies. more Allergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with allergic rhinitis. One preliminary clinical trial shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 140 mg orally three times a day plus cetirizine (Zyrtec) 10 mg daily for one month decreases the severity of allergic rhinitis symptoms when compared with placebo plus cetirizine ( 18105 ). more Alzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with Alzheimer disease. A small, single-blind clinical study in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that taking milk thistle 450 mg daily for 3 months improves scores on the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) when compared with placebo ( 113978 ). However, another small clinical study in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that taking milk thistle extract (Livergol, Goldaru Herbal Products Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg three times daily for 6 months does not improve MMSE or Clinical Dementia Rating scores when compared with placebo ( 114913 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a supplement containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin 150 mg in combination with ferulic acid, gamma-oryzanol, and apigenin orally twice daily for 3 months to 2 years may stabilize mental functioning in patients with Alzheimer disease when compared to baseline ( 63223 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination. more Amanita mushroom poisoning. While an intravenous milk thistle constituent, silibinin, has been studied for treating Amanita mushroom poisoning, this product is not readily available in the U.S. Preliminary evidence from uncontrolled studies shows that administering silibinin, a constituent of milk thistle, intravenously (IV) within 48 hours of Amanita phalloides (death cap) mushroom poisoning, followed by oral therapy, may lessen liver damage ( 2615 , 63293 ). However, silibinin is not readily available in the US. more Atrial fibrillation. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for preventing atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting. A clinical study in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting shows that taking oral milk thistle constituent silymarin 400 mg daily 3 days before surgery reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation when compared with placebo. However, the validity of these findings is limited by the single-center study design ( 116131 ). more Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for benign prostatic hyperplasia. A small clinical study in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia shows that adding milk thistle extract (Liversil, Rose Pharmed Pharmaceutical Company) 240 mg twice daily for 3 months to tamsulosin improves prostate symptom scores, irritation, obstruction, prostate volume, and post-void residuals, but not serum prostate specific antigen levels, when compared with placebo plus tamsulosin ( 114910 ). However, it is unclear whether the noted improvements are clinically significant. Milk thistle has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 190 mg along with selenium 80 mcg orally three times daily for 6 months may improve lower urinary tract symptoms, urinary flow rates, and residual volumes in adults aged 45-70 years with BPH when compared with placebo ( 88155 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to milk thistle, selenium, or the combination. more Beta-thalassemia. Meta-analyses of clinical studies in patients with beta-thalassemia suggest that oral silymarin, a constituent of milk thistle, reduces serum ferritin levels. Most small clinical studies and meta-analyses of these studies show that taking silymarin in conjunction with conventional iron chelation medications such as deferiprone, deferasirox, or deferoxamine, is more effective for reducing serum ferritin levels than taking a conventional medication alone ( 88154 , 98452 , 107375 ). In one meta-analysis, the combination of silymarin and deferasirox appeared to be more effective than combinations with other iron chelation medications ( 107375 ). However, one preliminary clinical study in patients 12 years of age and older with beta-thalassemia shows that taking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 140 mg orally three times daily for 3 months, in conjunction with deferoxamine, does not improve serum ferritin when compared with deferoxamine alone ( 63212 ). This difference in outcome is likely due to the shorter duration of therapy. Silymarin also does not seem to affect total iron binding capacity or liver iron concentration in patients with beta-thalassemia ( 107375 ). more Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema. It is unclear if topical milk thistle is beneficial in patients with acral erythema due to capecitabine. Preliminary clinical research shows that applying a gel containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin 1% twice daily to the hands and feet, starting from the first day of chemotherapy and continuing for 9 weeks thereafter, prolongs the time to onset of acral erythema and decreases its severity when compared with placebo in patients with gastrointestinal cancer who are receiving capecitabine for the first time ( 95022 ). more Chemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity. Results of clinical studies are mixed over whether oral milk thistle prevents or improves chemotherapy-induced hepatotoxicity. One small clinical study in children and adults up to age 21 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and elevated liver function tests (LFTs) shows that taking a specific product containing the milk thistle constituent silibinin (Siliphos, Thorne Research, Inc.) 80-320 mg (depending on patient weight) daily for 28 days concurrently with chemotherapy does not improve LFTs or bilirubin levels when compared with placebo ( 63218 ). Another small clinical study in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer receiving doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel shows that taking a specific milk thistle extract of silymarin (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg three times daily with meals for 4 weeks does not improve fatty liver grading or LFTs when compared with placebo ( 105795 ). A similar small clinical study in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, with or without paclitaxel shows that taking this same milk thistle extract 140 mg three times daily for 9 weeks attenuates an increase in fatty liver grade liver grade but does not consistently improve LFTs after each course of chemotherapy ( 114914 ). Conversely, a large clinical study in children aged 5-14 with elevated liver enzymes and receiving chemotherapy for ALL shows that taking silymarin 70 mg capsules twice daily or 50 mg syrup three times daily for 9 months modestly improves aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin levels, but does not improve alkaline phosphatase or albumin levels ( 113144 ). Observational research in patients with a variety of solid tumors and elevated LFTs due to chemotherapy or targeted therapy suggests that taking silymarin 150-900 mg daily is associated with reduced or stabilized LFTs in over half of patients; however, doses above 300-450 mg daily don't seem to have much more benefit ( 111176 ). The interpretation of these results is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for the prevention of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. A small clinical study shows that taking a milk thistle extract standardized to 70% to 80% silymarin (Liverherb, Amin Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg orally three times daily with meals, starting 24-48 hours before cisplatin and continuing until the end of three 21-day cycles, does not prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity when compared with placebo ( 95025 ). more Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. A small clinical study in adults with cancer receiving cisplatin chemotherapy shows that taking a specific product (Livergol, Goldaru) containing milk thistle 140 mg three times daily for 3 months improves overall symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy when compared to baseline, but not when compared with placebo, with the possible exception of hyposthesia to touch and pins and needles sensation which had worsened only in the placebo group ( 113979 ). more Cirrhosis. It is unclear if oral milk thistle extracts of silymarin are beneficial for cirrhosis from various causes. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 420 mg orally daily for up to 4 years might improve liver function tests and decrease mortality in people with cirrhosis due to a variety of causes ( 2616 , 63145 , 63278 , 63340 ). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research evaluating milk thistle studies for the treatment of various liver diseases shows that effect sizes are generally small or lack statistical significance ( 63161 ). An observational study in adults with hepatitis B virus-related liver cirrhosis suggests that taking milk thistle 150 mg 2-3 times daily for at least 30 days in combination with anti-viral therapy is associated with lower mortality and liver transplantation rates at 1- and 2-year follow up and greater improvement in international normalized ratio, model for end-stage liver disease score, and the Charlson comorbidity index at 1-year follow-up when compared with anti-viral therapy alone ( 113986 ). more Contrast induced nephropathy. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for reducing the risk of nephropathy from contrast agents. Population research in Taiwanese patients with liver cirrhosis has found that taking silymarin daily for at least 90 days during a one-year period does not reduce the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy during the following four or more years ( 98453 ). more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for COVID-19. Preliminary clinical research in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 requiring non-invasive oxygen support shows that taking a specific milk thistle product (SinaLive, Exir Nano Sina Company), 70 mg orally three times daily for 2 weeks, does not improve time to symptom resolution, lung scores, or length of stay when compared with placebo ( 109504 ). more Critical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in critically ill patients with trauma-induced liver injury. One small clinical study in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to trauma-induced liver injury shows that taking a specific milk thistle extract (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) containing silymarin 140 mg three times daily for 14 days reduces markers of liver injury, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), when compared with placebo ( 105793 ). Whether this milk thistle extract improves morbidity, mortality, or length of ICU stay in these patients is unclear. more Diabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for improving kidney function in patients with this condition. Preliminary clinical research in type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 140 mg orally three times daily for 3 months, in combination with conventional treatment decreases the urine albumin to creatinine ratio when compared with placebo. However, serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate are not improved ( 63250 ). more Dyslipidemia. Oral milk thistle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A meta-analysis of three clinical trials in adults with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking a specific combination product (Berberol, PharmExtracta) containing milk thistle extract 105 mg and tree turmeric extract 588 mg twice daily for 3 months, along with diet and exercise, reduces levels of LDL cholesterol by an average of 34 mg/dL when compared with diet and exercise alone. There was no effect on HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels ( 101158 ). The studies included in this meta-analysis are generally of low quality, lasted for no more than 12 months, and sometimes include patients with statin intolerance ( 95019 , 96140 , 101158 ). Other clinical research shows that taking a similar product (Berberol K, PharmExtracta) containing milk thistle extract 105 mg, tree turmeric extract of berberine 500 mg, and monacolin K and KA 10 mg, taken once daily for 3 months along with diet and exercise, reduces levels of LDL cholesterol by about 28% when compared with diet and exercise alone in patients with hypercholesterolemia ( 97625 ). It is possible that any benefit of this product is due to the monacolin content. It is unclear if these effects are due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination. more Dyspepsia. Oral milk thistle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A specific combination product containing milk thistle (Iberogast, Medical Futures, Inc.) seems to improve symptoms of dyspepsia. The combination includes milk thistle plus peppermint leaf, German chamomile, caraway, licorice, clown's mustard plant, celandine, angelica, and lemon balm ( 19532 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research using this combination product shows that taking 1 mL orally three times daily over a period of 4 weeks reduces severity of acid reflux, epigastric pain, cramping, nausea, and vomiting when compared with placebo ( 13089 ). more Endometriosis. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with endometriosis. Preliminary clinical research in females with ovarian endometrioma shows that taking a specific silymarin product (Goldaru Pharma) 140 mg twice daily for 12 weeks moderately improves pain scores, but not other sexual function scores, when compared with placebo ( 110486 ). However, some researchers have also recommended to avoid using milk thistle in estrogen-sensitive conditions, such as endometriosis, due to its estrogenic effects ( 93025 , 93026 ). more Gambling disorder. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for gambling disorder. A small clinical study in adults with gambling disorder shows that taking milk thistle 150 mg twice daily for 2 weeks and then 300 mg daily for the next 6 weeks does not improve symptoms associated with gambling disorder, including gambling urges, thoughts, and behaviors, or improve symptoms of anxiety and depression when compared with placebo ( 113974 ). The interpretation of these results is limited by the small sample size and a strong placebo effect. more Hepatitis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral milk thistle extracts of silymarin may improve hepatitis symptoms. It is unclear whether these products can improve liver function in these patients. In people with hepatitis due to a variety of causes, taking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 140 mg orally three times daily for 4 weeks reduces symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, and scleral icterus, but does not improve liver function tests (LFTs) ( 63210 , 63317 ). However, some improvements in LFTs are seen with a silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex (Silipide, Inverni della Beffa Research and Development Laboratories) taken as 160-360 mg orally daily for 2 weeks to 3 months ( 63320 , 63321 ). However, there are methodological problems with these latter studies. more Hepatitis B. Small clinical studies suggest that oral milk thistle extracts may improve liver function in people with hepatitis B, although it is unclear if these products can improve disease-related complications. Preliminary clinical studies suggest that taking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 140 mg orally three times daily for 28 days to one year, or a silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex (Silipide, Inverni della Beffa Research and Development Laboratories) 240 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, improves liver function tests (LFTs) and liver histology ( 7356 , 63263 , 63299 ). However, another study shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 140 mg orally three times daily for 5-25 days has no effect of LFTs ( 63288 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research and a review conclude that any clinical effect of milk thistle in people with viral hepatitis is very limited and results suggest that it lacks a significant effect on mortality, liver disease complications, or liver histology ( 17228 , 63192 ). more Hepatitis C. Small clinical studies suggest that oral milk thistle extracts may improve liver function but do not seem to reduce hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels. Preliminary clinical studies show that taking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 140 mg orally three times daily for 3-12 months, or a silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex (Silipide, Inverni della Beffa Research and Development Laboratories) 240 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, improves liver function tests (LFTs) and liver histology ( 7356 , 63299 ). However, other studies report that taking silymarin 125-140 mg three times daily for up to one year, 166 mg twice daily for 3 months, or 400 mg daily for 8 weeks does not improve serum HCV RNA levels, anti-HCV antibody levels, LFTs, or hepatomegaly ( 13170 , 63208 , 63247 , 63288 , 108658 ). Also, taking higher doses of silymarin, up to 700 mg three times daily for 6 months, does not have a significant effect on serum HCV RNA levels or LFTs when compared with placebo ( 63251 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research and a review conclude that any clinical effect of milk thistle in people with viral hepatitis is limited and most results show that milk thistle lacks a significant effect on mortality, liver disease complications, or liver histology ( 17228 , 63192 , 88156 ). Preliminary clinical research in adults with HCV-related advanced chronic liver disease shows that taking a specific milk thistle combination product containing silybinphospholipid complex 303 mg, vitamin D 10 mcg, and vitamin E 15 mg (Realsil 100 D, Ibi Lorenzini), twice daily for 12 months, improves liver stiffness scores, but not liver fibrosis scores, when compared with control ( 108659 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination. more Hyperlipoproteinemia. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia secondary to liver disease. One very small crossover study shows that taking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 420 mg orally daily for 7 months does not significantly improve cholesterol levels in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia secondary to liver disease when compared with placebo ( 63255 ). more Hypoxic liver injury. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for reducing liver injury in patients with hypoxia. Preliminary clinical research in patients presenting to the emergency department with hypoxia shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 280 mg every 8 hours for 3 days reduces markers of liver injury, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), when compared with placebo ( 103871 ). more Infertility. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 70 mg orally three times daily in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) lowers the proportion of early and total apoptosis of follicle cells during in vitro fertilization due to male infertility. However, it does not have an effect on the number of oocytes retrieved or the thickness of the endometrium when compared with HCG plus placebo ( 63227 ). more Lactation. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for increasing milk production. A small clinical study shows that taking a milk thistle extract standardized to 60% silymarin (BIO-C, Milte Italia S.r.l.) 240 mg twice daily for 4 weeks does not increase milk production when compared with placebo in mothers of preterm newborns ( 95027 ). more Melasma. It is unclear if topical milk thistle is beneficial in patients with melasma. Preliminary clinical research in adults with melasma shows that applying silymarin 1.4% cream twice daily for 3 months moderately improves melasma appearance scores when compared to baseline. These improvements were similar to hydroquinone cream 2% ( 110489 ). One small clinical trial in females with melasma shows that application of silymarin 1.4% cream twice daily to the affected area for 3 months is as effective for improving melasma area and severity as a specific type of laser therapy (low fluence Q switched ND:YAG 1064 nm) ( 105791 ). more Menopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral milk thistle reduces menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. One small clinical study in postmenopausal patients shows that taking milk thistle fruit extract 200 mg, containing 80% silymarin, twice daily for 8 weeks seems to reduce the number and severity of daily hot flashes and overall climacteric symptoms when compared with taking placebo ( 105053 ). This finding is limited by incomplete reporting and potentially inadequate blinding. Other preliminary clinical research has evaluated milk thistle in combination with black cohosh, dong quai, red clover, American ginseng, and chasteberry (Phyto-Female, SupHerb), with some evidence of benefit for reducing hot flashes and night sweats. ( 19552 ). more Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for MASLD. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults with MASLD shows that taking milk thistle monotherapy may decrease the liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) when compared with no intervention or placebo. ( 117139 ). The validity of these findings are limited by insufficient power, risk of bias, and heterogeneity across studies. Furthermore, a moderate-sized clinical study in patients with MASLD shows that taking milk thistle extract equivalent to 51.6 mg of silybin twice daily for 6 months reduces liver stiffness, but not levels of ALT, AST, or bilirubin when compared with placebo ( 114918 ). A moderate-sized, open-label, non-controlled study in patients with MASLD shows that taking milk thistle standardized to silymarin 150 mg twice daily for 6 months does not improve liver stiffness or liver enzymes when compared with essential phospholipids. It is unclear if any changes in these outcomes are statistically significant when compared to baseline ( 114462 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo group. However, a clinical study in Romania in adults with MASLD shows that taking a specific combination product, Esentin Trio, containing milk thistle (standardized to silymarin 100 mg), vitamin E, and essential phospholipids twice daily for 6 months reduces liver function tests (ALT, AST, GGT, alkaline phosphatase) and improves liver fibrosis and steatosis when compared with baseline. Additionally, the milk thistle combination improved blood glucose, body mass, and lipid profiles compared to baseline ( 117138 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. It is unclear if this effect is due to milk thistle, vitamin E, essential phospholipids, or the combination. Also review milk thistle's effectiveness in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a similar condition. more Metabolic syndrome. Oral silymarin, a constituent of milk thistle, seems to improve some of the laboratory abnormalities associated with metabolic syndrome. A meta-analysis of 11 low-quality clinical trials in adults with metabolic syndrome, conducted in Asia and Africa, shows that silymarin, 140-2100 mg daily for 45 days to 12 months, modestly reduces fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo ( 107374 ). more Multiple sclerosis (MS). Oral milk thistle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in patients with MS shows that taking a supplement containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin 150 mg in combination with ferulic acid, gamma-oryzanol, and apigenin twice daily for 3-24 months may stabilize clinical symptoms of MS when compared to baseline ( 63223 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination. more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Small clinical studies suggest that oral milk thistle extracts of silymarin may slightly improve markers of liver function patients with NAFLD. Four meta-analyses of up to 23 mostly small clinical trials in patients with NAFLD show that taking milk thistle products containing a total of silymarin 140-2100 mg daily, either alone or in combination with other ingredients, for 8-48 weeks reduces aspartate aminotransferase (AST) by 7-13 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by 9-17 IU/L when compared with control ( 97622 , 105051 , 113976 , 113982 ). However, these changes in liver enzymes may not be clinically impactful and some experts note that serum AST levels do not reliably reflect the spectrum of liver histology in patients with NAFLD ( 98130 ). Metabolic indices have also been evaluated. A meta-analysis of up to 20 mostly small clinical studies in patients with NAFLD shows that taking milk thistle for up to 48 weeks slightly improves serum lipids when compared with control ( 113976 ). A small clinical study in adults with NAFLD and a body-mass index (BMI) of at least 35 kg/m 2 shows that taking milk thistle extract 140 mg 4 times daily for 8 weeks, in addition to lifestyle modifications, reduces BMI by approximately 1 kg/m 2 when compared with placebo with lifestyle modifications ( 108657 ). However, another small clinical trial in adults with NAFLD and a BMI of at least 40 kg/m 2 shows that taking a specific silymarin product (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceuticals) 140 mg three times daily for 4 weeks did not reduce BMI or improve liver enzymes, such as AST and ALT, when compared with placebo ( 110484 ). A meta-analysis of 7 small clinical trials also shows there is little to no change in BMI associated with silymarin use in these patients ( 113976 ). One small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking a specific combination product (Eurosil 85, MEDAS SL) containing milk thistle extract standardized to silymarin 540 mg and vitamin E 36 mg daily for 3 months, in addition to following a low-calorie diet, does not appear to improve NAFLD-Fibrosis score or fatty liver index (FLI) when compared with following a low-calorie diet alone ( 96261 ), though a meta-analysis of 2 small clinical studies in patients with NAFLD shows that taking milk thistle for 12-24 weeks does reduce FLI when compared with control ( 113976 ). Also review milk thistle's effectiveness in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a similar condition. more Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with NASH. Clinical research in patients with NASH shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 700 mg three times daily for 48 weeks improves fibrosis in more patients when compared with placebo ( 96107 ). However, there is no significant between-group difference in global histological improvement with this product ( 96107 ) or with a specific silymarin product (Legalon, Rottapharm Madaus, Mylan) 420 or 700 mg three times daily for 48-50 weeks ( 101150 ). Pooling 1 of these clinical studies ( 96107 ) into a meta-analysis with another clinical trial that evaluated milk thistle in combination with phosphatidylcholine and vitamin E suggests an improvement in fibrosis by at least one stage when compared with placebo ( 113984 ). However, it is unclear if this effect is due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination. Metabolic indices have also been evaluated. A meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with NASH or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) shows that taking milk thistle reduces aspartate aminotransferase (AST) by about 13 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by about 17 IU/L, serum triglycerides by about 23 mg/dL and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by about 2 mg/dL, but does not alter gamma-glutamyl transferase, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, or insulin resistance when compared with control ( 113982 ). However, trials on NAFLD and NASH were not analyzed separately which limits the generalizability of these findings to patients with NASH specifically. The dose and duration of milk thistle treatment was also not described. more Obesity. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with obesity. A meta-analysis of 11 clinical studies in healthy adults and adults with various medical conditions shows that taking milk thistle does not reduce body weight or body mass index when compared with placebo or control ( 113987 ). A very small open-label study in adult females with obesity suggests that taking a specific milk thistle extract product (Neocholal-S, Italmex) 151.5 mg, containing silybin 45 mg, twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight but may reduce fasting blood glucose levels and insulin resistance when compared to baseline ( 113980 ). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group and very small sample size. more Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with OCD. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking milk thistle leaf extract 200 mg orally three times daily for 8 weeks has a limited effect on OCD symptom scores when compared to baseline, but does not provide any benefit over fluoxetine 10 mg three times daily ( 63219 ). more Parkinson disease. Oral milk thistle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a supplement containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin 150 mg in combination with ferulic acid, gamma-oryzanol, and apigenin orally twice daily for 3 months to 24 months may stabilize clinical symptoms in patients with Parkinson disease when compared to baseline ( 63223 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to milk thistle, other ingredients, or the combination. more Postpartum complications. It is unclear if topical milk thistle is beneficial in postpartum patients with an episiotomy. Preliminary clinical research in postpartum patients shows that applying milk thistle 3% in Eucerin ointment twice daily to the suture site for 10 days reduces episiotomy pain and improves the healing rate when compared with placebo. The milk thistle product was prepared with an ethanolic extract of the seeds to provide 1.53% silybin ( 107373 ). more Prostate cancer. Oral milk thistle has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in patients with a history of prostate cancer who have had radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy shows that taking a dietary supplement containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin 160 mg, soy isoflavones (Novasoy, ADM) 62.5 mg, lycopene (Lyc-O-Mato, LycoRed Natural Products Industries, Ltd.) 15 mg, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants orally daily for 10 weeks increases the time it takes for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels to double by 2.6-fold when compared with placebo ( 60361 ). more Radiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical milk thistle is beneficial in patients with dermatitis due to radiation. Preliminary clinical research in females with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy shows that applying a specific topical product containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin (Leviaderm, Madaus GmbH) significantly reduces the incidence of radiation dermatitis and prolongs the time to the onset of radiation dermatitis when compared with applying a panthenol-containing cream ( 63239 ). Additionally, meta-analysis pooling this study ( 63239 ) with one other small clinical study also shows that applying a cream or gel containing milk thistle extract reduces the incidence radiation dermatitis when compared with control ( 113674 ). more Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for rheumatoid arthritis. A moderate-sized clinical study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on conventional RA medications shows that taking milk thistle (Silymarin Forte, Zenyth Pharmaceuticals SRL) 300 mg, in addition to standard RA medications, daily for 8 weeks reduces the number of tender and swollen joints, the duration of morning stiffness, severity of disease activity, and fatigue, depression and anxiety scores when compared with standard RA medicationsl ( 114915 ). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of blinding and lack of a placebo control. more Toxin-induced liver damage. Most small clinical studies suggest that oral milk thistle extracts or constituents may reduce liver injury in people exposed to some, but not all, toxins and medications known to cause liver damage. Taking a milk thistle extract containing 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) 420 mg orally daily for up to one month improves liver function tests (LFTs) in people with abnormal LFTs due to chronic occupational exposure to paints or organic solvents such as toluene or xylene ( 2614 , 63280 ). Milk thistle extract has also shown some benefit for reducing drug-induced liver injury (DILI). In patients on isotretinoin therapy for acne, taking a specific milk thistle extract containing silymarin (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg daily for 30 days improves LFTs when compared with placebo ( 102852 ). A small clinical study in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who were initiating therapy with fingolimod shows that taking a specific milk thistle extract (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) containing silymarin 140 mg daily for 6 months prevents fingolimod-induced LFT elevations when compared with placebo ( 105794 ). In patients receiving treatment for tuberculosis with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin, taking the milk thistle constituent silibinin 70 mg orally three times daily for 6-12 months reduces the rate of liver toxicity to 14% compared with 53% in patients taking glucuronolactone 200 mg orally three times daily ( 63224 ). Additionally, in patients receiving standard treatment for tuberculosis with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 140 mg orally three times daily for 4 weeks decreases the risk of DILI by 28% when compared with placebo. About 1 in every 4 patients who take silymarin for 4 weeks would avoid DILI ( 95024 ). A small clinical study in Iran, also in adults receiving standard treatment for tuberculosis, shows that taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 150 mg twice daily for 2 weeks modestly improves LFTs when compared with control. None of the 16 patients in the silymarin group developed DILI compared with 2 of 21 patients in the control group; however, this finding was not statistically significant ( 112230 ). The interpretation of these findings is limited by the short study duration. However, taking a milk thistle extract of silymarin 420 mg orally daily for 3 months does not seem to prevent liver toxicity associated with tacrine (Cognex) therapy in people with Alzheimer disease ( 63140 ). Other research in people with elevated LFTs due to long-term therapy with phenothiazine or butyrophenone antipsychotic medications shows that taking silymarin 800 mg orally daily for 3 months also does not improve LFTs when compared with placebo ( 63344 ). A retrospective study in patients with DILI of various offending agents has also found that taking a milk thistle extract, containing a median of 450 mg silybin daily for 24 days is associated with 1.7-2.8 times higher likelihood of LFT normalization when compared with control ( 110485 ). more Trichotillomania. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with this condition. Preliminary clinical research in patients 12-65 years of age shows that taking milk thistle 150 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, and then 300 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, does not improve symptoms of trichotillomania when compared with placebo ( 99426 ). more Ulcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial in patients with this condition. Preliminary clinical research in patients 16-75 years of age shows that taking a specific milk thistle extract of silymarin (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg daily for 6 months, in conjunction with standard medications, decreases disease activity and helps maintain remission when compared with placebo in patients with ulcerative colitis ( 95029 ). more Vitiligo. It is unclear if oral milk thistle reduces the severity of this condition. Preliminary clinical research in a small number of patients with vitiligo shows that taking a specific milk thistle extract containing silymarin (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) 140 mg twice daily along with phototherapy for 3 months does not improve the severity of vitiligo when compared with phototherapy plus placebo ( 102851 ). However, a small clinical study in patients with vitiligo undergoing hair follicle transplantation and phototherapy shows that taking this same milk thistle extract 70 mg twice daily for 3 months increases perifollicular re-pigmentation when compared with hair follicle transplantation plus phototherapy ( 114912 ). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a placebo. more Radiation mucositis . It is unclear if oral milk thistle is beneficial for preventing or treating mucositis due to radiation. One small clinical study in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy for the first time shows that taking a specific product containing a milk thistle extract of silymarin (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company), 140 mg three times daily starting from the first day of radiotherapy and continuing for 6 weeks thereafter, reduces the severity and prolongs the time to onset of radiation-induced mucositis when compared with placebo ( 95021 ). more More evidence is needed to rate milk thistle for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. A specific milk thistle extract standardized to contain 70% to 80% silymarin (Legalon, Madaus GmbH) has been safely used in doses up to 420 mg daily for up to 4 years ( 2613 , 2614 , 2616 , 7355 , 63210 , 63212 , 63278 , 63280 , 63299 , 63340 )( 88154 , 97626 , 105792 ). Higher doses of up to 2100 mg daily have been safely used for up to 48 weeks ( 63251 , 96107 , 101150 ). Another specific milk thistle extract of silymarin (Livergol, Goldaru Pharmaceutical Company) has been safely used at doses up to 420 mg daily for up to 6 months ( 95021 , 95029 , 102851 , 102852 , 105793 , 105794 , 105795 , 113979 , 114909 , 114913 )( 114914 ). Some isolated milk thistle constituents also appear to be safe. Silibinin (Siliphos, Thorne Research) has been used safely in doses up to 320 mg daily for 28 days ( 63218 ). Some combination products containing milk thistle and other ingredients also appear to be safe. A silybin-phosphatidylcholine complex (Silipide, Inverni della Beffa Research and Development Laboratories) has been safely used in doses of 480 mg daily for 7 days ( 7356 ) and 240 mg daily for 3 months ( 63320 ). Tree turmeric and milk thistle capsules (Berberol, PharmExtracta) standardized to contain 60% to 80% silybin have been safely used twice daily for up to 12 months ( 95019 , 96140 , 96141 , 96142 , 97624 , 101158 ). Possibly Safe when used topically and appropriately, short-term. A milk thistle extract cream standardized to silymarin 0.25% (Leviaderm, Madaus GmbH) has been used safely throughout a course of radiotherapy ( 63239 ). Another milk thistle extract cream containing silymarin 1.4% has been used with apparent safety twice daily for 3 months ( 105791 , 110489 ). A cream containing milk thistle fruit extract 25% has been used with apparent safety twice daily for up to 12 weeks ( 111175 ). A milk thistle extract gel containing silymarin 1% has been used with apparent safety twice daily for 9 weeks ( 95022 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of intravenous formulations of milk thistle or its constituents. CHILDREN: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately, short-term. A milk thistle extract 140 mg three times daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 9 months ( 88154 , 98452 ). A specific product containing the milk thistle constituent silybin (Siliphos, Thorne Research Inc.) has been used with apparent safety in doses up to 320 mg daily for up to 4 weeks in children one year of age and older ( 63218 ). PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: While research in an animal model shows that taking milk thistle during pregnancy and lactation does not adversely impact infant development ( 102850 ), there is insufficient reliable information available about its safety during pregnancy or lactation in humans; avoid using.</data><data key="name">Milk Thistle (Silymarin)</data></node>

Niacin is converted to niacinamide when ingested in amounts that do not exceed physiological requirements. When used in physiological amounts, the effects of niacin and niacinamide are indistinguishable. Niacin is water-soluble and well-absorbed when taken orally ( 505 , 6243 , 11694 ). Dietary sources include meats, beans, cereal grains, fish, and various niacin-fortified foods. In addition, some dietary tryptophan is converted to niacin in the body. Consumption of tryptophan 60 mg equals 1 mg of niacin or one niacin equivalent ( 2677 , 6243 ). Niacin is a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). These coenzymes are essential for oxidation-reduction reactions, ATP synthesis, and ADP-ribose transfer reactions ( 2677 ). Antibacterial effects Evidence from animal research and preliminary clinical research suggests that niacin can prevent fluid loss in patients with cholera by reversing cholera toxin-induced intestinal secretion ( 4868 , 26119 ). Cardiovascular effects Some research suggests niacin has cardioprotective effects while other research suggests the opposite. In patients with hyperlipidemia or peripheral arterial disease, niacin reduces fibrinogen concentrations in plasma and possibly stimulates fibrinolysis ( 4871 , 8547 ). Evidence from animal research suggests that niacin helps preserve the myocardium following cardiac arrest and reperfusion by inhibiting beta-oxidation during preischemia and reperfusion, preventing the degradation of membrane phospholipids, reducing free fatty acid accumulation, and stimulating glycolysis ( 26120 ). Laboratory research suggests that niacin inhibits the formation of some cellular mediators in platelets, and increasing the production of others, resulting in an inhibition in platelet aggregation ( 26121 ). Increased production of some of these mediators plays a role in the visual flushing that occurs with niacin-induced vasodilation ( 6243 ). Despite the potential effects of niacin on vasodilation, any cardiovascular benefits of niacin do not appear to be related to improved endothelial or vascular function in patients with coronary artery disease or metabolic syndrome ( 93351 , 93353 ). Additionally, metabolomics analysis of blood from adults at high cardiovascular risk who had participated in observational studies conducted in Europe and the United States suggests that higher levels of circulating niacin terminal metabolites are associated with greater risk of major adverse cardiovascular events independent of traditional risk factors. Additionally, laboratory research on these identified metabolites shows that, at physiological levels, they elicit expression of vascular adhesion molecule 1 on human vascular endothelial cells and enhanced leukocyte adherence to vascular endothelium ( 113554 ). Central nervous system (CNS) effects There is interest in using niacin for Parkinson disease. Parkinson disease itself, as well as treatment with levodopa, are associated with low plasma levels of niacin ( 107943 , 107944 ). Preliminary clinical research in adults with Parkinson disease shows that taking slow-release niacin 250 mg orally daily for 12 months increases niacin plasma levels; however, there is no association between niacin levels and changes in motor scores ( 107944 ). In addition, clinical research shows conflicting effects of supplemental niacin on Parkinson disease symptoms ( 107943 , 107944 ). Endocrine effects Niacin can impair glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, probably by causing or aggravating insulin resistance ( 4863 , 11692 ). The effects of niacin on triglyceride synthesis may also increase hepatic output of glucose by enhancing fatty acid utilization in the liver at the expense of glucose ( 4860 , 11693 , 26127 ). Hypolipemic effects Niacin 1 gram daily or more can decrease total cholesterol by 8% to 21%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 8% to 25%, lipoprotein(a) by 23%, and triglycerides by 20% to 50%, as well as increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations by 15% to 35% ( 8545 , 96213 ). By binding to a G-protein-coupled receptor on adipocytes, niacin inhibits free fatty acid release from adipose tissue and inhibits cyclic AMP accumulation, which controls the activity of triglyceride lipase and hence lipolysis ( 26127 ). It also decreases the rate of liver synthesis of LDL and VLDL and increases the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma secondary to increased lipoprotein lipase activity ( 6243 ). Also, clinical research shows that niacin can reduce the number of VLDL particles, particularly the larger VLDL particles; increase the number of large but not small HDL particles; decrease the number of smaller, denser LDL particles; and increase the number of larger LDL particles ( 26123 , 26124 ). In vitro research suggests that niacin increases HDL and apolipoprotein (apo) A-1 levels by reducing the uptake of HDL and apoA-1-containing HDL particles by liver cells, without affecting the removal of cholesterol ester-containing HDL particles ( 26122 ). The liver enzyme diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) plays a key role in the esterification of fatty acids to form triglycerides ( 26126 ). Evidence from in vitro research suggests that niacin reduces the synthesis of triglycerides by inhibiting the activity of DGAT2 ( 26125 ). Niacin deficiency Niacin deficiency causes pellagra, a condition characterized by dermatitis, diarrhea and dementia ( 2677 , 6243 ). Pellagra was common in the early twentieth century, but niacin-fortified foods have virtually eliminated this disease in the West. It can be seen in patients with poor diet, chronic alcoholism, carcinoid tumors that decrease endogenous niacin production, and Hartnup disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that interferes with tryptophan absorption ( 4850 , 6243 ). Conditions that increase niacin requirements, such as hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, pregnancy, and lactation, can sometimes result in deficiency, but this is rare ( 4969 ). Some researchers think that sleep deprivation-induced dermatitis might be caused by niacin depletion because of similarities between this condition and pellagra ( 1350 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Likely Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Niacin</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Likely Effective Dyslipidemia. Niacin prescription products, in doses of 500 mg or greater, are FDA-approved for primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Niacin dietary supplements are generally available in lower doses and have not been shown to improve lipid levels. Prescription niacin is not routinely recommended as second-line therapy for patients who primarily need to decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This is due to results from clinical trials showing no effect on cardiovascular related events or mortality ( 93346 , 93354 , 96208 , 96211 , 97308 , 97477 , 97336 ). However, niacin might be considered for patients with mixed hyperlipidemia or patients who need to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lower triglycerides. Niacin might also be effective for isolated hypoalphalipoproteinemia ( 4817 ). The most pronounced increases in HDL and decreases in triglycerides occur at 1-1.5 grams daily, and the greatest LDL reduction occurs at 2-3 grams daily. Niacin reduces LDL cholesterol by up to 25%, compared with up to a 55% reduction with statins. High-dose niacin can also decrease triglycerides by 20% to 50%, increase HDL by 13% to 35%, decrease apolipoprotein B levels by 2% to 20%, and decrease lipoprotein(a) levels by 23% ( 4818 , 4886 , 4887 , 4888 , 4889 , 4890 , 12033 , 25567 , 93347 , 96213 ). The effects of higher dose extended-release niacin on LDL cholesterol and triglycerides appear to be greater in females than males ( 25565 ). Experts recommend maximizing statins first because they have the best evidence for improving cardiovascular outcomes ( 97477 , 97336 , 97337 ). However, if patients cannot reach their LDL goal with a statin alone or if they cannot tolerate a statin, niacin might be combined with other cholesterol-lowering drugs when diet and single-drug therapy are not adequately effective ( 8545 , 25566 , 93351 , 94191 , 97337 ). Adding low-dose niacin, 50 mg daily, to statin therapy has no additional benefit on lipid levels ( 8546 ). Population research in adults without dyslipidemia has also found that higher dietary intake of niacin for 3-10 years is associated with a 29% lower risk of developing dyslipidemia when compared with low dietary niacin intake ( 110493 ). more Pellagra. Oral niacin is FDA-approved for the prevention and treatment of pellagra. Population research has found that low consumption of niacin is associated with an increased risk of developing pellagra ( 25903 ). Taking niacin 500-1000 mg daily can resolve symptoms of pellagra within a week of treatment initiation ( 25904 ). However, niacinamide is sometimes preferred for this indication because it lacks the vasodilating effects of niacin ( 15 , 6243 ). more Possibly Effective HIV/AIDS-related dyslipidemia. Oral niacin seems to improve lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia due to HIV/AIDs. Small clinical trials in HIV patients with dyslipidemia associated with antiretroviral therapy shows that taking extended-release niacin (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) titrated up to 2 grams daily for 14-48 weeks improves total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when compared to baseline ( 25570 , 25902 ). Other preliminary clinical research in this population shows that taking extended-release niacin (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) titrated to 2 grams daily for up to 2 years improves HDL cholesterol levels, but not total cholesterol or triglyceride levels, when compared with no treatment ( 25569 ). more Metabolic syndrome. Oral niacin seems to improve lipid levels in patients with metabolic syndrome. Clinical research shows that taking niacin (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) 2 grams daily orally for 16 weeks reduces triglyceride levels by 39 mg/dL and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 5 mg/dL when compared to baseline in patients with metabolic syndrome. These improvements are significant when compared with placebo and are further increased when niacin is taken along with prescription omega-3 ethyl esters (Lovaza, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals) 4 grams daily orally ( 93353 ). However, niacin does not seem to improve postprandial glucose levels in patients with metabolic syndrome ( 97333 ). more Ineffective Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral niacin does not seem to reduce cardiovascular-related events in patients with or without CVD. Overall, niacin is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. Most clinical trials and meta-analyses conducted prior to 2011 showed a reduction in cardiovascular-related events, cardiovascular-related mortality, and all-cause mortality in patients taking niacin alone or in combination with a statin or clofibrate for primary or secondary prevention of CVD ( 4847 , 7388 , 25095 , 25911 , 25912 , 93349 ). However, recent meta-analyses of these studies and additional moderate-to-high quality research conducted in over 39,000 patients show no effect of niacin on cardiovascular-related events, cardiovascular-related mortality, or overall mortality ( 93346 , 93354 , 96208 , 96211 , 97308 ). Additionally, one meta-analysis shows that patients taking niacin are twice as likely to report side effects when compared with placebo ( 96211 ). Furthermore, an analysis of blood from adults at high cardiovascular risk suggests that higher levels of circulating niacin terminal metabolites are associated with greater risk of major adverse cardiovascular events independent of traditional risk factors ( 113554 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Alzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for reducing Alzheimer disease risk. Observational research has found that consuming higher amounts of niacin (17-45 mg daily) from food and supplements is associated with a slower cognitive decline and a lower risk of developing Alzheimer disease when compared with people who consume less niacin (14 mg daily) ( 12077 ). It is not known if the risk of Alzheimer disease is reduced by taking a stand-alone niacin supplement. more Atherosclerosis. It is unclear if oral niacin prevents atherosclerosis progression. Preliminary clinical studies show that taking niacin orally, in combination with colestipol for up to 2 years, might modestly reduce progression of atherosclerosis as measured by coronary lesions and carotid arterial intima-media thickness in high-risk males with existing coronary atherosclerosis ( 25906 , 25909 , 25910 ). However, niacin does not seem to be better than statins. One clinical study in adults with atherosclerosis and peripheral arterial disease shows that taking extended-release niacin 1500 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, and ezetimibe 10 mg daily for 2 years does not reduce atherosclerosis of the superficial femoral artery when compared with simvastatin alone ( 96208 ). Niacin has also not been shown to prevent cardiovascular events or mortality ( 93346 , 93354 , 96208 , 96211 , 97308 ). more Athletic performance. It is unclear if oral niacin improves athletic performance. Preliminary clinical research in untrained adult males shows that taking niacin 1000 mg orally once before a cycling test does not improve power, respiratory exchange ratio, or time to exhaustion when compared with placebo. In addition, these measures were significantly worse when compared with taking caffeine 5 mg/kg orally as a single dose ( 107942 ). Clinical research in untrained males also shows that taking a supplement containing niacin 40 mg, caffeine 400 mg, capsicum extract 66.7 mg, and black pepper extract 10 mg prior to exercising does not improve strength, time to exhaustion, or maximal oxygen consumption when compared with placebo ( 37873 ). more Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there is interest in using oral niacin for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this condition. Cancer. It is unclear if dietary niacin is beneficial for cancer. Population research in adults with cancer has found that high dietary niacin intake is associated with 49% and 27% lower risk of cancer-related mortality and all-cause mortality when compared with low dietary niacin intake. The same study also found that taking niacin supplements is associated with a lower risk of cancer-related mortality, but not all-cause mortality when compared with not taking niacin supplements ( 110496 ). more Cataracts. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for preventing cataracts. Population research has found that high dietary intake of niacin is associated with a reduced risk of nuclear cataracts ( 6378 ). However, there is no reliable evidence that niacin supplements reduce the risk of cataracts. more Cholera. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for cholera. One small clinical study in adults with severe cholera shows that taking 1-2 grams niacin orally reduces fluid loss in the stool by 31% to 47% in the first 16 hours when compared with control. The 2 gram dose seemed to result in a greater reduction in fluid loss than the 1 gram dose ( 4868 ). more Erectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial in patients with ED and dyslipidemia. Clinical research in patients with erectile dysfunction and dyslipidemia shows that taking extended-release niacin (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) titrated to 1.5 grams nightly for a total of 12 weeks significantly improves penetration frequency and the maintenance of an erection after penetration when compared to baseline ( 25913 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Glaucoma. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for preventing or treating glaucoma. Population research has found that higher dietary intake of niacin is associated with a lower odds of having glaucoma. However, this association was not consistently present when adjusting for confounders. The effects of niacin supplementation on glaucoma have not been evaluated ( 107942 ). more Hyperphosphatemia. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for preventing high levels of phosphorus in the blood. Preliminary clinical research in patients on maintenance dialysis who are no longer using phosphate binders shows that taking niacin 375-750 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces serum phosphorus levels by 2.1 mg/dL, increases calcium levels by 0.4 mg/dL, and decreases serum alkaline phosphatase when compared with baseline ( 25914 ). A small clinical study in Iranian adults on maintenance hemodialysis, with baseline serum phosphorus levels within normal range, shows that adding niacin 600 mg daily to standard of care for 8 weeks slightly reduces serum phosphorus levels when compared with control ( 116763 ). Clinical significance is unlikely. However, clinical research in patients on dialysis with inadequate phosphate control despite standard phosphate-binding therapy shows that taking niacin at the maximum tolerated dose, up to 1000 mg daily, for 12 weeks, does not decrease serum phosphate levels when compared with placebo ( 93341 ). It is possible that this latter study was too small to observe between-group differences in changes in serum phosphate levels. more Hypertension. It is unclear if dietary niacin is beneficial for preventing hypertension. Observational research in Chinese adults found a J-shaped association between dietary niacin intake and development of hypertension, with the lowest risk occurring in those with a daily dietary niacin intake of 14.3-16.7 mg ( 104934 ). more Meniere disease. Although there is interest in using oral niacin for Meniere disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this condition. Migraine headache. It is unclear if dietary niacin is beneficial for preventing migraine headaches. Population research in adults has found that high dietary intake of niacin is associated with a 28% lower likelihood of having migraine headaches when compared with low dietary intake of niacin ( 110495 ). However, the effect of niacin supplementation on migraines has not been studied. more Motion sickness. Although there is interest in using oral niacin for motion sickness, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this purpose. Parkinson disease. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for improving Parkinson disease symptoms. Low-quality clinical research in adults with Parkinson disease shows that taking slow-release niacin 250 mg orally daily for 12 months improves Parkinson disease motor scores and fatigue scores by 17% and 26%, respectively, when compared with baseline ( 107944 ). However, higher quality clinical research shows that taking niacin 250 mg orally daily for 6 months does not improve Parkinson disease motor scores when compared with placebo ( 107943 ). more Retinal vein occlusion. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for improving retinal vein occlusion symptoms. A small case series in patients with chronic retinal vein occlusion shows that taking niacin titrated to 500 mg three times daily for 1 year is associated with reduced central macular thickness and improved visual acuity in over 50% of patients when compared with a control group. The addition of prednisolone eye drops does not alter the outcomes of those taking niacin ( 96212 ). The validity of this finding is limited due to the retrospective nature of this study. more Schizophrenia. Although there is interest in using oral niacin for schizophrenia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this condition. Sickle cell disease. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for improving lipid levels in patients with sickle cell disease. A small clinical study in patients with sickle cell disease shows that taking extended-release niacin titrated to 1.5 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve vascular function or increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or apolipoprotein A-I cholesterol levels when compared with placebo ( 96209 ). more Vertigo. Although there is interest in using oral niacin for vertigo, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this condition. More evidence is needed to rate niacin for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when niacin is taken in food or as a supplement in amounts below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 30 mg daily for adults 18 years of age and 35 mg daily for adults 19 years and older ( 6243 ). ...when prescription products are used orally and appropriately in doses of up to 2 grams daily ( 12033 ). Likely Safe when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The ULs of niacin for children are: 1-3 years of age, 10 mg daily; 4-8 years of age, 15 mg daily; 9-13 years of age, 20 mg daily; 14-18 years of age, 30 mg daily ( 6243 ). CHILDREN : PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL of niacin during pregnancy and lactation is 30 mg daily for 14-18 years of age and 35 mg daily for 19 years and older ( 6243 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of larger oral doses of niacin during pregnancy or lactation; avoid using.</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: General : Niacin is expressed on supplement labels as Niacin Equivalents (NE). 1 mg of niacin is the same as 1 mg NE. However, the total niacin content stated on a label can also include other forms of niacin, including niacinamide, inositol nicotinate, and tryptophan. Tryptophan 60 mg, niacinamide 1 mg, and inositol nicotinate 1 mg are all equivalent to 1 mg NE ( 6243 ). The Institute of Medicine publishes a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin B3, which includes niacin and niacinamide. The daily RDA of vitamin B3, expressed as NE, is: males 14 years and older, 16 mg NE; females 14 years and older, 14 mg NE; pregnancy, 18 mg NE; and breastfeeding, 17 mg NE ( 6243 ). Prescription niacin is most often used at a dose of 1-2 grams daily. Research on the use of supplemental niacin is limited. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Concomitant ingestion of hot drinks with niacin may magnify niacin-induced flushing ( 6243 ). Children Oral: General : The daily adequate intake (AI) of vitamin B3 for infants 0-6 months of age is 2 mg of preformed niacin. For all other age groups, the daily recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin B3 (niacin or niacinamide) is expressed as niacin equivalents (NE). The RDA for children is: 7-12 months of age, 4 mg NE; 1-3 years of age, 6 mg NE; 4-8 years of age, 8 mg NE; 9-13 years of age, 12 mg NE; females 14-18 years of age, 14 mg NE; males 14-18 years of age, 16 mg NE ( 6243 ). Research is limited; typical dosing of supplemental niacin is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization &amp; Formulation Niacin is available in immediate-release formulations and, by prescription, in extended-release formulations. One specific extended-release niacin prescription formulation (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) releases niacin at a rate of 100 mg/hour ( 18 ).</data><data key="interactions_text">Expand All | Collapse All ALCOHOL (Ethanol) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Concomitant use of alcohol and niacin might increase the risk of flushing and hepatotoxicity. Alcohol can exacerbate the flushing and pruritus associated with niacin ( 4458 , 11689 ). Large doses of niacin might also exacerbate liver dysfunction associated with chronic alcohol use. A case report describes delirium and lactic acidosis in a patient taking niacin 3 grams daily who ingested 1 liter of wine ( 14510 ). Advise patients to avoid large amounts of alcohol while taking niacin. more ALLOPURINOL (Zyloprim) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence C (Expert opinion) Theoretically, niacin might antagonize the therapeutic effects of uricosurics such as allopurinol. Large doses of niacin can reduce urinary excretion of uric acid, potentially resulting in hyperuricemia ( 4860 , 4863 , 12033 ). Doses of uricosurics such as allopurinol might need to be increased to maintain control of gout in patients who start taking niacin ( 4458 ). People who have frequent attacks of gout despite uricosuric therapy should avoid niacin ( 4863 ). more ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, niacin may have additive effects when used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. Several cases of clotting factor synthesis deficiency and coagulopathy have been reported in patients taking sustained-release niacin ( 25915 ). Also, thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients treated with niacin or niacin plus lovastatin ( 25916 ). more ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Niacin can increase blood glucose levels and may diminish the effects of antidiabetes drugs. Niacin impairs glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, probably by causing or aggravating insulin resistance and increasing hepatic production of glucose ( 4860 , 4863 , 11692 , 11693 ). In diabetes patients, niacin 4.5 grams daily for 5 weeks can increase plasma glucose by an average of 16% and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 21% ( 4860 ). However, lower doses of 1.5 grams daily or less appear to have minimal effects on blood glucose ( 12033 ). In some patients, glucose levels increase when niacin is started, but then return to baseline when a stable dose is reached ( 12033 , 93344 ). Up to 35% of patients with diabetes may need adjustments in hypoglycemic therapy when niacin is added ( 4458 , 4860 , 4863 , 11689 , 12033 ). more ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Clinical cohort study) Theoretically, niacin may increase the risk of hypotension when used with antihypertensive drugs. The vasodilating effects of niacin can cause hypotension ( 4863 , 12033 , 93341 ). Furthermore, some clinical evidence suggests that a one-hour infusion of niacin can reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure in hypertensive patients. This effect is not observed in normotensive patients ( 25917 ). more ASPIRIN Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity INSIGNIFICANT Occurrence LIKELY Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Large doses of aspirin might alter the clearance of niacin. Aspirin is often used with niacin to reduce niacin-induced flushing ( 4458 , 11689 ). Doses of 80-975 mg aspirin have been used, but 325 mg appears to be optimal ( 4458 , 4852 , 4853 , 11689 ). Aspirin also seems to reduce the clearance of niacin by competing for glycine conjugation. Taking aspirin 1 gram seems to reduce niacin clearance by 45% ( 14524 ). This is probably a dose-related effect and not clinically significant with the more common aspirin dose of 325 mg ( 11689 , 14524 ). more BILE ACID SEQUESTRANTS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Bile acid sequestrants can bind niacin and decrease absorption. Separate administration by 4-6 hours to avoid an interaction. In vitro studies show that colestipol (Colestid) binds about 98% of available niacin and cholestyramine (Questran) binds 10% to 30% ( 14511 ). more GEMFIBROZIL (Lopid) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use of niacin and gemfibrozil might increase the risk of myopathy in some patients. A case of myopathy from concomitant use of niacin and gemfibrozil has been reported ( 25920 ). Niacin alone has also been associated with cases of myopathy ( 26100 , 26111 ). Using gemfibrozil with niacin might further increase the risk of developing myopathy. more HEPATOTOXIC DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use of niacin and hepatotoxic drugs might increase the risk of hepatotoxicity. Niacin has been associated with cases of liver toxicity, especially when used in pharmacologic doses ( 4863 , 11689 , 11691 , 25929 , 25930 , 25931 , 113553 ). Sustained-release niacin preparations appear to be associated with a higher risk of hepatotoxicity than immediate-release niacin ( 11691 , 25930 , 25931 , 93342 , 113553 ). more HMG-CoA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS ("Statins") Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, concomitant use of niacin and statins might increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis in some patients. Some case reports have raised concerns that niacin might increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when combined with statins ( 14508 , 25918 ). However, a significantly increased risk of myopathy has not been demonstrated in clinical trials, including those using an FDA-approved combination of lovastatin and niacin (Advicor) ( 7388 , 11689 , 12033 , 14509 ). more PROBENECID (Benemid) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence C (Expert opinion) Theoretically, niacin might antagonize the therapeutic effects of uricosurics such as probenecid. Large doses of niacin reduce urinary excretion of uric acid, potentially causing hyperuricemia ( 4863 , 12033 ). Doses of uricosurics such as probenecid might need to be increased to maintain control of gout in patients who start taking niacin ( 4458 ). People who have frequent attacks of gout despite uricosuric therapy should avoid niacin ( 4863 ). more SULFINPYRAZONE (Anturane) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence C (Expert opinion) Theoretically, niacin might antagonize the therapeutic effects of uricosurics such as sulfinpyrazone. Large doses of niacin reduce urinary excretion of uric acid, potentially causing hyperuricemia ( 4863 , 12033 ). Doses of uricosurics such as sulfinpyrazone might need to be increased to maintain control of gout in patients who start taking niacin ( 4458 ). People who have frequent attacks of gout despite uricosuric therapy should avoid niacin ( 4863 ). more THYROID HORMONE Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, niacin might antagonize the therapeutic effects of thyroid hormones. Clinical research and case reports suggests that taking niacin can reduce serum levels of thyroxine-binding globulin by up to 25% and moderately reduce levels of thyroxine (T4) ( 25916 , 25925 , 25926 , 25928 ). Patients taking thyroid hormone for hypothyroidism might need dose adjustments when using niacin. more TRANSDERMAL NICOTINE (Nicoderm) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use of niacin and transdermal nicotine might increase the risk of flushing and dizziness. Niacin and nicotine can both cause flushing and dizziness ( 496 , 96211 ). more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) There is limited evidence that niacin may increase the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. In a case report, a patient on warfarin developed an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 3.9 after taking niacin for two weeks. The patient's INR was previously stable, ranging between 2 and 3 in recent months, and no other medication changes were identified. The elevated INR returned to therapeutic range within 4 days following the discontinuation of niacin ( 116762 ). more</data><data key="name">Niacin</data><data key="scientific_name">3-Pyridinecarboxylic Acid, Niacin, Nicotinic acid, Vitamin B3</data><data key="overview_text">Niacin is one form of vitamin B3.

Trans-resveratrol appears to be the primary active form. Resveratrol is primarily found in red wine, red grape skins, purple grape juice, mulberries, and in smaller amounts in peanuts ( 513 , 2030 , 2956 ). Trans-resveratrol is also found in blueberries and bilberries. Raw blueberry and bilberry fruit may contain higher concentration of some constituents compared to cooked fruit. Heating blueberries or bilberries for 18 minutes at 190°C results in a loss of 17% to 46% of resveratrol content due to degradation ( 16053 ). Other sources of resveratrol include eucalyptus (Eucalyptus wandoo, Eucalyptus sideroxylon), spruce (Picea excelsa), and Bauhinia racemosa ( 2030 ). Polygonum cuspidatum (Hu Zhang), the roots of which are used in Chinese and Japanese traditional medicine, is considered to be one of the richest sources of trans-resveratrol ( 2030 , 15154 ). The trans-resveratrol content of wine is highly dependent on grape type, climate, and practices used to make the wine. White wines have very low trans-resveratrol concentrations. They have only about 1% to 5% the quantity found in red wines ( 15154 ). Pinot noir consistently has the highest concentrations of trans-resveratrol, regardless of climate. Wine prepared from Pinot noir grapes averages 5.13 mg resveratrol per liter ( 2030 , 15154 ). Other red wines, including Cabernet Sauvignon, produced in cold, humid climates, such as Bordeaux and Canada, have higher trans-resveratrol content than those produced in hot, dry climates ( 2030 ). Resveratrol is not found in significant quantities in fermented grape beverages that are stored in oak barrels, such as cognac ( 7864 ). Anti-colitis effects In animal models of colitis, resveratrol reduces colonic damage and decreases inflammation by reducing neutrophil infiltration, cytokine levels, and inflammatory prostaglandins. Resveratrol also appears to enhance colonic cell apoptosis ( 15141 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Resveratrol has anti-inflammatory activity, likely due to inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2, hydroperoxidases, and 5-lipoxygenase ( 2030 , 2948 , 12482 , 12484 , 56943 ). In vitro, resveratrol may be more selective for COX-1 as it appears to inactivate COX-1, but only weakly inhibits COX-2 based on some research ( 15140 , 15148 ). However, some evidence does suggest that resveratrol inhibits COX-2 ( 70815 , 70816 ). Some evidence suggests that resveratrol is a more potent anti-inflammatory agent than NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or indomethacin ( 12483 , 15154 ). In animal models, intra-articular injections and doses of resveratrol decrease inflammation and reduce cartilage destruction ( 15095 , 71081 ). Resveratrol also seems to decrease the activity of inflammatory cytokines ( 6126 ). Resveratrol reduces interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-8, and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) released from alveolar macrophages isolated from smokers ( 15155 ). This suggests that resveratrol might have a role in reducing inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although some results from individual clinical trials disagree ( 95828 ), clinical research from meta-analyses shows that resveratrol reduces inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha ( 105182 , 105184 , 109602 , 109168 , 114526 ). However, meta-analyses show that resveratrol does not reduce levels of the inflammatory marker IL-6 ( 109168 , 114526 ). Antiaging effects Research in animals on a high-calorie diet shows that resveratrol can increase lifespan and improve other factors associated with a longer lifespan including increasing insulin sensitivity and decreasing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) ( 15093 ). Laboratory research suggests that the anti-aging effects of resveratrol may be partly due to the activation of enzymes involved in slowing the pace of aging. This enzyme activation may be similar to the anti-aging effects of caloric restriction ( 70916 , 70942 , 70980 , 71005 ). Resveratrol and calorie restriction also activate sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that improves mitochondrial function and increases cellular antioxidant capacity, leading to improved cardiovascular function and possible antiaging effects ( 112944 ). Anticancer effects There is interest in resveratrol for preventing cancer and improving mortality. Trans-resveratrol has antimutagenic activity ( 2948 , 15144 ). Preliminary research in animal models suggests resveratrol might reduce the risk of cancer. It seems to inhibit tumor growth, promote apoptosis, and delay metastasis ( 2948 , 2958 , 2959 , 12482 , 70961 ). The effect of resveratrol on cellular apoptosis differs depending on conditions. In some cases, it facilitates apoptosis and in others it inhibits apoptosis. In vitro, low concentrations of resveratrol inhibit hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis of human leukemia cells ( 15143 ). Also, resveratrol inhibits growth and induces cell death of ovarian cancer cell lines. However, cell death appears to be mediated through autophagocytic processes rather than apoptosis ( 15147 ). Resveratrol also inhibits growth and induces apoptotic cell death of breast cancer cell lines, medulloblastoma cell lines, and other cell lines in vitro ( 7861 , 15149 , 15156 , 15157 , 15164 , 71119 , 70903 , 70915 , 70917 , 71120 ). However, in an animal model, adding resveratrol to the diet does not decrease intestinal tumor load as measured by COX-2 expression ( 15150 ). Preliminary data also suggests that resveratrol may prevent liver cancer cells from invading local tissues ( 7862 ). Antidiabetic effects Clinical research shows that resveratrol may reduce blood glucose and HbA1c, and improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 71066 , 71097 , 91329 , 105183 ). However, it does not appear to improve beta-cell function ( 71066 ). Some clinical evidence has attributed the antidiabetic effects of resveratrol to its ability to decrease oxidative stress ( 71066 ). Also, animal research suggests that the antidiabetic effects of resveratrol may result from its ability to modulate enzymes involved in inflammation and apoptosis ( 71062 , 71080 ). Antioxidant effects Resveratrol significantly reduces lipid peroxidation and organ damage in animal models of ischemia-reperfusion ( 15144 , 70825 , 70842 , 70996 ). Preliminary research suggests that chronic administration of resveratrol might improve myocardial function in models of myocardial ischemia ( 15096 ). In humans and laboratory research, resveratrol appears to reduce levels of oxidative compounds and protect against oxidation ( 64633 , 70919 , 70941 , 70979 , 71112 ). Laboratory research suggests that resveratrol protects against the oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and DNA ( 70809 , 70832 , 70865 ). Antiplatelet effects Resveratrol seems to have anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects in laboratory research ( 2030 , 2948 , 2949 , 2950 , 2951 , 2952 , 2961 , 15139 , 70813 , 70828 )( 70831 , 70876 , 70892 , 70968 , 71106 ). Antiviral effects Resveratrol inhibits the replication of herpes simplex virus. Although the mechanism of this action is not fully known, exposure to resveratrol within one hour of cellular infection appears to be most effective in arresting viral growth. This suggests that resveratrol reduces production of proteins needed to regulate viral proliferation ( 7866 ). Resveratrol also appears to inhibit the replication of the rhinovirus, the influenza A virus, and the cytomegalovirus ( 70945 , 91336 , 91337 ). Cardioprotective effects There is interest in resveratrol for preventing cardiovascular disease and improving mortality. Trans-resveratrol has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity ( 2948 , 15144 ). Preliminary research suggests that chronic administration of resveratrol might improve myocardial function in models of myocardial ischemia ( 15096 ). In vitro, resveratrol appears to inhibit Chlamydia pneumoniae ( 15151 ). Systemic dissemination of Chlamydia has been suggested as a possible cause of atherosclerosis and heart disease. Some researchers speculate that resveratrol's activity against Chlamydia could explain some of wine's cardiovascular benefits. Other potential cardioprotective effects of resveratrol, as shown in human and laboratory research, have included regulation of vasodilation and vasoconstriction, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and inhibition of platelet aggregation ( 2954 , 70819 , 70973 , 71015 ). Resveratrol has been shown to modulate the activity of endothelial cells and nitric oxide production ( 2030 , 70886 , 71023 , 71033 , 71045 , 71111 ). Also, evidence from human and animal research suggests that resveratrol may reduce blood pressure ( 71085 , 71109 ). Generally, although in vitro and animal data have shown cardioprotective effects, most research in humans shows no benefit of resveratrol on risk factors for cardiovascular disease ( 91330 , 91333 , 95835 ). Cardiovascular effects Resveratrol activates sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase involved in mitochondrial function, increasing its plasma levels, and also decreases plasma noradrenaline levels. Circulating levels of SIRT1 are positively correlated with nitrate-mediated vasodilation in both sexes, and also predict flow-mediated vasodilation in males but not females. Increased SIRT1 levels are associated with improved cardiovascular function ( 112944 ). Dental effects Trans-resveratrol orodispersible tablets increase acid-resistant and antibacterial proteins in the acquired enamel pellicle, which might protect tooth enamel from erosion and dental caries ( 114544 ). Estrogenic effects Resveratrol is a weak phytoestrogen ( 2960 , 15142 ). It binds to both alpha and beta estrogen receptors, but its affinity for these receptors is about 7000 times less than estrogen ( 7865 , 19085 , 70901 ). Trans-resveratrol has mixed agonist and antagonist activity on the estrogen-alpha receptor, whereas cis-resveratrol has significantly less activity at the estrogen receptor ( 15146 , 70858 , 70863 ). Resveratrol has been studied for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Preliminary clinical research shows that taking resveratrol (RevGenetics) 1,500 mg daily for 3 months decreases levels of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone but not insulin levels or sensitivity compared to placebo in women with PCOS ( 95823 ). Resveratrol has been also assessed for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Risk factors of BPH include family history, obesity, and lack of physical activity. Clinical research shows that taking trans-resveratrol 150 mg or 1,000 mg daily for 4 months does not affect prostate volume, prostate specific antigen (PSA), or testosterone levels compared to placebo in middle-aged men with metabolic syndrome. The higher dose of resveratrol did lower dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione levels possibly due to resveratrol's weak phytoestrogenic effects ( 95829 ). Hepatoprotective effects In humans with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatoprotective effects of resveratrol may have been related to reduced levels of inflammatory markers and apoptosis of liver cells ( 91328 ). Resveratrol also appears to decrease mortality in animal models of alcohol-related liver damage ( 15094 ). In a separate model, resveratrol appears to reduce hepatic injury associated with trauma hemorrhage; mechanisms of action may have involved the estrogen receptor and reduced inflammatory mediators ( 70983 ). Immunologic effects Resveratrol appears to have immunomodulatory activity. But the effects seem to differ in vitro compared to in vivo. In vitro, resveratrol appears to suppress T cell proliferation. In vivo, using animal models, resveratrol does not appear to have this effect, or affect blood cell counts or other measures of immune system activity ( 15152 ). At least in vitro, the effects of resveratrol on T cell proliferation may also be due to dose. While low-dose resveratrol stimulated the production of specific T cells, this was inhibited with high concentrations ( 70866 ). Lipid effects In animal research, resveratrol appears to improve abnormal lipid profiles ( 71062 ). Resveratrol inhibits formation of cholesterol in certain strains of bacteria ( 7863 ), but it is not known if this contributes significantly to cholesterol lowering in humans or animals. Some data suggest it does not. Clinical research in healthy humans shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg orally daily for 30 days increases levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B ( 112944 ). Neuroprotective effects Resveratrol is of interest in preventing and treating Alzheimer disease. In vitro, resveratrol prevents beta-amyloid peptide-related reductions in glutathione. This suggests that resveratrol might prevent oxidative damage caused by beta-amyloid (Ab) peptide ( 15153 ). Resveratrol appears to also block amyloid beta-aggregation ( 71031 ). Resveratrol has been assessed for its effects on purported markers of Alzheimer disease such as tau and Ab40 proteins. Clinical research shows that taking encapsulated resveratrol starting at 500 mg daily and increasing by 500 mg daily every 13 weeks for a total of 52 weeks resulted in a greater Ab40 marker concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid but no difference in the markers Ab42, Ab40, Ab42, tau, and phospho-tau 181 compared to placebo in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer disease ( 95833 ). Additionally, clinical research shows that resveratrol increases cerebrospinal fluid and plasma levels of Ab40, but not Ab42. This suggests that resveratrol suppresses neuroinflammatory activity by stabilizing Ab40, making it less likely to aggregate and contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease ( 114517 ). In human research, resveratrol increases cerebral blood flow, as evidenced by increased hemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin ( 71039 ). The potential neuroprotective effects of resveratrol are also thought to be due to improved glucose metabolism, preserved hippocampal volume, and enhanced hippocampal functional connectivity, all of which have been demonstrated in human studies ( 102511 , 102512 ). Resveratrol has also been shown to offer benefits in in vitro and animal models of epilepsy, ischemia, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and nerve injury ( 71004 , 71016 , 71055 ). It is possible that resveratrol protects against neuronal apoptotic cell death by modulating the expression of apoptotic genes or interfering with signaling pathways ( 70844 , 71022 , 71026 ). Laboratory research suggests that the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol may be at least partially due to the modulation of enzymes involved in apoptosis and inflammation ( 71000 , 71032 , 7054 , 71055 ). Pulmonary effects Some preliminary laboratory research suggests that resveratrol may play a role in the reduction of asthma symptoms. In vitro, resveratrol appears to inhibit inflammatory mediators from human airway smooth muscle cells ( 71048 ). Resveratrol also appears to inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators from cells isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ( 15155 ). Renoprotective effects Clinical research shows that taking resveratrol might improve glomerular filtration rate and levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, while in vitro research suggests that resveratrol's renoprotective effects may be due to inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor and preservation of mitochondrial complex III activity, thereby protecting renal mitochondria from oxidative stress ( 112136 ). Weight loss effects Resveratrol appears to have weight loss effects in both clinical and laboratory research. In humans with metabolic syndrome, resveratrol appears to reduce body weight and fat mass ( 91331 ). It has been suggested that resveratrol binds to cannabinoid CB1 receptors in laboratory research ( 71114 ). Laboratory research also suggests that resveratrol may also reduce the production and proliferation of adipocytes or fat cells, and decrease the production of stored fat ( 91338 ). Resveratrol may also mimic caloric restriction in terms of regulating signal transduction pathways and enzyme production ( 91339 ). However, a small clinical trial in healthy adults shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg daily for 30 days does not have a significant effect on body weight or body mass index ( 112944 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Likely Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Resveratrol</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Allergic rhinitis (hay fever). Intranasal resveratrol seems to be beneficial for reducing allergic rhinitis symptoms in adults and children. Some clinical research shows that intranasal resveratrol with carboxymethyl-beta-glucan can improve symptoms of allergic rhinitis ( 91332 , 97339 ). One clinical study in adults with allergic rhinitis shows that using an intranasal spray containing resveratrol 0.1% three times daily for 4 weeks reduces nasal symptoms and improves quality of life scores when compared with placebo ( 97339 ). A study in children aged 4-17 years with pollen-induced allergic rhinitis shows that using an intranasal spray containing resveratrol 0.05% three times daily for 2 months improves itching, sneezing, runny nose, and nasal obstruction and reduces use of rescue medication when compared with placebo ( 91332 ). more Obesity. Oral resveratrol seems to be beneficial for weight loss in individuals with overweight or obesity. However, it is unlikely to be beneficial for improving most metabolic parameters in this population. A meta-analysis of 28 clinical trials shows that taking resveratrol modestly decreases body weight by 0.5 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 0.17 kg/m2, and waist circumference by 0.8 cm when compared with placebo or no intervention. This analysis included studies of individuals with normal weight, overweight, and obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or other chronic conditions. A subgroup analysis suggests that individuals with obesity have a greater response to resveratrol. In these individuals, taking resveratrol 8-3000 mg daily resulted in an average weight reduction of 1.15 kg and a BMI reduction of 0.3 kg/m2 when compared with placebo. The greatest impact on body weight and BMI occurred with resveratrol doses of no more than 500 mg daily and treatment durations of at least 3 months ( 100696 ). However, it is unclear whether any improvements are clinically significant. more Possibly Ineffective Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral resveratrol does not seem to be beneficial for CVD prevention. Population research suggests that a higher dietary intake of resveratrol is not associated with a reduced risk of CVD when compared with a lower dietary intake ( 91334 ). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking resveratrol for up to 6 months does not improve any measures of plasma lipids, including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides in patients at high risk for CVD ( 91333 ). While one preliminary clinical study shows that taking resveratrol 10 mg daily for 3 months improves left ventricular function by about 1% and endothelial function when compared to baseline in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease, the improvements are very small and blood pressure and markers of inflammation do not appear to be improved ( 91330 ). more Hypercholesterolemia. Oral resveratrol does not seem to be beneficial for hypercholesterolemia. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that resveratrol is unlikely to be beneficial for improving blood lipids when compared with placebo in patients with hypercholesterolemia. In the meta-analysis, studied populations included people who are overweight or obese, as well as patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), angina, and dyslipidemia ( 105181 ). Although there was a small reduction in total cholesterol levels of approximately 7 mg/dL, resveratrol did not improve levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides ( 105181 ). Also, an analysis of results from clinical research shows that taking resveratrol for up to 6 months does not improve any measures of plasma lipids, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or triglycerides in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease ( 91333 ). Also, clinical research in healthy humans shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg orally daily for 30 days increases levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B ( 112944 ). Another meta-analysis identified more promising results; however, any effect on blood lipids may not be considered clinically significant. This meta-analysis included 17 clinical studies enrolling 968 participants with dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, overweight or obesity, or stroke. Resveratrol reduced total cholesterol by approximately 10 mg/dL, LDL by approximately 6 mg/dL, and triglycerides by approximately 9 mg/dL, but did not improve HDL, when compared with placebo. However, most of the included studies were small and utilized heterogenous dosing regimens, with doses ranging from 10-3000 mg daily for 4-48 weeks ( 110020 ). more Metabolic syndrome. Oral resveratrol does not seem to be beneficial for metabolic syndrome. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking resveratrol does not improve blood pressure when compared with placebo in patients with metabolic syndrome or related disorders ( 102513 ). A similar meta-analysis shows that taking resveratrol does not improve levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, or liver enzymes. There was a small reduction in total cholesterol levels of approximately 7 mg/dL ( 105181 ). However, only 3-4 of the papers included in these meta-analyses, which included 28-31 publications, evaluated patients with metabolic syndrome. The remainder included patients with related conditions, such as overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The mainly small or preliminary clinical studies that did evaluate patients with metabolic syndrome all show that taking resveratrol 100-1000 mg daily for 12-16 weeks does not improve blood pressure, glucose control, or plasma lipids ( 91331 , 95828 , 102513 , 105181 ). However, one preliminary clinical trial shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg three times daily for 3 months reduces body weight by about 4 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 1.3 kg/m2, fat mass by 2.4 kg, and waist circumference by 4 cm when compared to baseline ( 91331 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, a moderate-sized clinical trial of adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking resveratrol 300 mg and delta-tocotrienols 500 mg daily for 24 weeks improves body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, total and HDL cholesterol, and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress when compared with placebo ( 112144 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to resveratrol, delta-tocotrienols, or the combination. more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral resveratrol does not seem to be beneficial for most metabolic symptoms of NAFLD. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for improving steatosis. Although some individual studies disagree, meta-analyses reviewing 4-6 preliminary clinical studies show that taking resveratrol does not affect liver enzyme levels, insulin resistance, blood pressure, blood lipids, body mass index (BMI), or abdominal size when compared with placebo in patients with NAFLD ( 95826 , 99048 , 105184 ). Most trials have studied doses of 300-3000 mg daily for 2-3 months; one study used resveratrol 500 mg 3 times daily for 6 months ( 95826 , 98911 , 99048 , 105184 ). However, one meta-analysis shows that taking resveratrol might have a small effect on levels of the inflammatory mediators C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha ( 105184 ). It is not clear if resveratrol might reduce steatosis in patients with NAFLD. One preliminary clinical study shows that taking resveratrol 3000 mg daily in two divided doses for 8 weeks does not improve steatosis when compared to baseline in males with NAFLD ( 91327 ). However, another preliminary clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg daily for 3 months, while following an energy-balanced diet and exercising, improves steatosis, but not fibrosis, insulin resistance, lipid levels, or body composition, when compared with lifestyle modifications alone ( 91328 ). The difference in these findings might be due to small study sizes, the duration of therapy, or the gender of the included patients. more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acne. It is unclear if topical resveratrol is beneficial for acne. Preliminary clinical research shows that applying a gel containing trans-resveratrol 1 mcg per gram to facial skin for 60 days reduces the severity of acne by about 54%, compared to only 6% for control gel ( 71064 ). more Age-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for age-related cognitive decline. One small clinical study shows that taking resveratrol 75 mg twice daily for 14 weeks modestly improves cognitive performance and memory after menopause, but not executive function or learning, when compared with placebo ( 95827 ). Another small clinical study in healthy, older adults shows that taking resveratrol 200 mg daily for 26 weeks improves memory retention, but not delayed recall or word recognition, when compared with placebo. In this study, resveratrol capsules were formulated to also contain 320 mg of quercetin to enhance the absorption of resveratrol ( 102511 ). It is unclear if resveratrol alone would result in similar effects. Despite these positive results, conflicting research exists. A small clinical study in sedentary, overweight, elderly adults shows that taking resveratrol 300 mg daily for 90 days does not improve measures of cognitive function such as psychomotor speed, attention, executive function, learning, or memory when compared with placebo. Taking a higher dose of 1000 mg daily for 90 days modestly improves psychomotor speed, but no other cognitive measures, in these patients ( 98907 ). Another small clinical study in healthy elderly adults shows that taking resveratrol 200 mg daily for 26 weeks does not improve verbal memory when compared with placebo ( 98909 ). more Aging skin. Although there has been interest in using oral resveratrol for aging skin, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of resveratrol for this purpose. Alzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for improving symptoms of Alzheimer disease. A meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that taking resveratrol or trans-resveratrol up to 500 mg daily for 12 to 52 weeks improves the ability to perform activities of daily living but does not change cognitive function when compared with placebo ( 114517 ). more Beta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for beta-thalassemia. A small clinical study in patients with beta-thalassemia intermedia shows that taking micronized trans-resveratrol (Xian Tianxingjian Natural Bio-Products CO., LTD) 2000 mg with piperine (Bioprex Co.) 40 mg, with or without hydroxyurea 8-15 mg/kg, daily for 6 months does not improve hemoglobin levels or affect the need for blood transfusion when compared with taking placebo with or without hydroxyurea ( 98908 ). more Cancer. It is unclear if dietary resveratrol is beneficial for cancer prevention. Population research has found that a higher dietary intake of resveratrol is not associated with a reduced risk of cancer when compared to lower dietary intake ( 91334 ). more Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of resveratrol 10 mg, vitamin C 180 mg, zinc 15 mg, and flavonoids 160 mg daily for 20 days followed by 10 days without supplementation, repeated for three cycles, modestly reduces symptoms of cough and sputum production in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD when compared with control ( 71130 ). It is not clear if these effects are due to resveratrol, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Cognitive function. Oral resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in healthy young adults shows that taking a specific supplement (Transmax by BiotiviaTM) containing trans-resveratrol 500 mg and piperine 10 mg daily for 28 days does not improve most measures of cognitive performance when compared with placebo ( 95834 ). more Cognitive impairment. Oral resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in a small number of patients with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking resveratrol 200 mg and quercetin 350 mg daily for 26 weeks does not improve learning and memory performance when compared with placebo ( 102512 ). However, given the small sample size, it is possible this study was inadequately powered to detect significant changes in these cognitive measures. more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for COVID-19. A small clinical trial in outpatients with COVID-19 shows that taking resveratrol (Vita-Age) 1 gram four times daily, for 7-15 days based on symptom duration, does not reduce the rate of hospitalization, emergency room visits, or pneumonia when compared with placebo. All patients also received a single dose of Vitamin D3 ( 109164 ). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect differences between groups. more Diabetes. Some research shows that oral resveratrol is beneficial for improving glycemic indices in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, more research is needed to determine the most effective dose or the patient population most likely to benefit. Although results from individual clinical studies have been mixed ( 91329 , 95825 , 95832 , 100695 , 109165 , 109167 , 109170 ), meta-analyses of clinical research show that resveratrol modestly reduces blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in patients with diabetes. Studies lasted 4-24 weeks and many included patients treated with antidiabetes medications, including metformin. However, these meta-analyses have yielded differing findings regarding effective doses ( 91329 , 109165 , 109167 , 109170 ). One meta-analysis of clinical research in individuals aged 45 years and older shows that doses of 250-1000 mg daily modestly reduce levels of fasting blood glucose, insulin, and HbA1c, as well as insulin resistance, when compared with placebo. Doses of up to 250 mg daily are generally ineffective, and only one study used doses greater than 1000 mg daily. Although sub-analyses suggest that these benefits may be limited to individuals aged 45-59 years, the number of studies in older individuals is small and findings are unclear ( 109165 ). A second meta-analysis in adults with type 2 diabetes suggests that resveratrol doses of at least 500 mg daily were necessary for reducing levels of fasting blood glucose and insulin, as well as insulin resistance ( 109167 ). A third meta-analysis, which also included Chinese language publications, shows that doses of resveratrol of at least 1000 mg daily are needed for improved glycemic control ( 109170 ). Some studies have used a specific resveratrol product (Biotivia Bioceuticals, International SrL) ( 95825 ). Although the reasons for discrepancies between individual clinical trials are not clear, it is possible that conflicting results are related to baseline blood glucose control. Resveratrol has shown benefit in patients with diabetes that is not well-controlled at baseline (HbA1c of 8% or higher) ( 91329 ), while results are mixed in patients with diabetes that is at least moderately well-controlled prior to supplementation (HbA1c of 7% or lower) ( 95825 , 100695 ). It is also possible that the differences may relate to the technique used to measure outcomes. For instance, resveratrol appears to improve insulin resistance when measured by the Stumvoll insulin sensitivity index, but not by the gold-standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique ( 95832 ). Resveratrol has also been evaluated for improving blood pressure, blood lipid, and liver transaminase levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Meta-analyses of clinical trials show that resveratrol has a small, but likely clinically insignificant, effect on systolic blood pressure when compared with placebo. Two meta-analyses show similar findings for diastolic blood pressure; however, some research suggests that any benefits are limited to doses of at least 500 mg daily ( 102513 , 109167 , 109170 ). Most meta-analyses of clinical research show that resveratrol does not improve blood lipid levels ( 105181 , 109167 , 109170 ) or liver transaminase levels ( 105181 ) when compared with placebo. Other clinical research in patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes shows that taking resveratrol 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks does not affect hepatic steatosis or cardiovascular risk indices when compared with placebo ( 109169 ). more Diabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for diabetic nephropathy. Preliminary clinical research in patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg plus losartan 12.5 mg daily for 90 days can reduce urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios, but not serum creatinine levels or glomerular filtration rates, when compared with taking placebo and losartan. When compared to baseline, the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio decreased by 46 mg/gram with resveratrol and increased by 25 mg/gram with placebo ( 100695 ). more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for lowering blood pressure. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that resveratrol is unlikely to be beneficial for improving systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo in patients with hypertension. In the meta-analysis, studied populations included people who are overweight or obese, as well as patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), stroke, and dyslipidemia ( 102513 ). More research is needed in patients with hypertension. more Migraine headache. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for treating migraine headache. A small clinical crossover study in patients with hormonal migraine headaches shows that taking resveratrol (Veri-te Resveratrol, Evolva SA) 75 mg twice daily for 3 months does not affect headache frequency, severity, or disability when compared with placebo ( 109166 ). However, this study did not include a wash-out period between treatments, introducing the potential for carry-over effects. more Mitochondrial myopathies. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for increasing exercise tolerance in patients with mitochondrial myopathies. A very small clinical trial in adults with mitochondrial myopathies shows that taking resveratrol (Veri-te resveratrol) 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve exercise capacity when compared with placebo ( 109162 ). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect differences between groups. more Osteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for osteoarthritis. A clinical study in adults with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking oral resveratrol 40 mg twice daily for 1 week then 20 twice mg daily for 6 months does not improve knee pain, function, or use of rescue medications when compared with placebo ( 115962 ). However, another clinical study in patients with mild or moderate knee osteoarthritis receiving physical therapy and meloxicam 15 mg daily shows that adding resveratrol 500 mg daily for 90 days improves pain, function, and stiffness when compared with adding placebo ( 98910 ). The discrepancy in findings between these studies may be due to differences in resveratrol formulation and dosing, concurrent medications allowed, or study populations. More research is needed to determine if resveratrol, alone or as adjunctive therapy, provides benefit for knee osteoarthritis. more Osteopenia. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for improving bone mineral density (BMD). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking resveratrol at doses of up to 1500 mg daily for 1-12 months does not increase BMD or alter bone biomarkers when compared with placebo ( 109163 ). The studies in this meta-analysis included various populations, such as postmenopausal or overweight individuals, or patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. However, a clinical study in healthy, postmenopausal females shows that taking fermented soy 200 mg, containing resveratrol 25 mg and equol 10mg, orally daily for 12 months increases whole-body BMD when compared with placebo. Levels of markers of bone formation, including osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, are increased, and the level of deoxypyridinoline, a marker of bone resorption, is decreased ( 112942 ). more Periodontitis. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for periodontitis. A small clinical study in individuals with chronic moderate-to-severe periodontitis who recently received non-surgical treatment for periodontitis shows that taking resveratrol 480 mg daily for 4 weeks improves plaque index when compared with placebo, but resveratrol does not seem to improve other markers of periodontitis, including pocket depth, bleeding index, clinical attachment loss, or salivary markers of inflammation ( 112135 ). The study may have been inadequately powered and too short in duration to detect a difference between the groups. more Peritoneal dialysis. It is unclear if oral resveratrol can improve outcomes with peritoneal dialysis. One clinical study shows that taking trans-resveratrol 150 mg or 450 mg daily for 12 weeks increases ultrafiltration rate and volume when compared with placebo in patients on peritoneal dialysis. The effect appears to be dose-dependent ( 95830 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for PCOS. Clinical research in patients with PCOS shows that taking resveratrol 1000 mg daily for 3 months results in a regular menstruation cycle length in 77% of individuals, compared with 52% of those taking placebo. The occurrence of hair loss was reduced by about 50%; however, there was no effect on hormone, metabolic, or lipid profiles. There was also a small increase in fat mass and decrease in fat-free mass, although the clinical relevance of these changes is unclear ( 109131 ). A small clinical trial in adults with PCOS shows that taking micronized trans-resveratrol (RevGenetics) 1500 mg daily for 3 months decreases levels of testosterone, but does not improve weight, lipid levels, insulin sensitivity, acne, or hirsutism, when compared with placebo ( 95823 ). A meta-analysis of 4 controlled trials of resveratrol, taken orally in doses of 800-1500 mg daily for 40 days to 3 months, shows reductions in levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate when compared with placebo, but no effect on follicle stimulating hormone, prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone, C-reactive protein, insulin, sex hormone binding globulin, lipids, acne, or pregnancy rates ( 112943 ). more Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for RA. A small clinical study shows that adding resveratrol 1 gram orally once daily as adjunct therapy to antirheumatic drugs for 2 months reduces the number of tender and swollen joints, as well as biomarkers of inflammation. It is not known whether resveratrol reduces joint damage when assessed using conventional radiography. Also, the most effective combination of resveratrol and antirheumatic drug is not known, since the patients in this study were taking different antirheumatic drugs at variable doses ( 95706 ). more Sciatica. Oral resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in patients with sciatica secondary to a herniated disk shows that taking a combination of resveratrol 50 mg with alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, and cholecalciferol orally once daily for 30 days, concurrently with a physiotherapy protocol, reduces pain and disability, and improves quality of life when compared with the physiotherapy protocol alone ( 112933 ). It is unclear if the effects are due to resveratrol, other ingredients, or the combination. more Ulcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for ulcerative colitis. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking trans-resveratrol (Sumabe Company) 500 mg daily for 6 weeks reduces subjective measures of disease activity and improves quality of life measures when compared with placebo in patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis ( 95831 ). However, a small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis shows that taking resveratrol (VeNatura Resveratrol Supplement) 250 mg twice daily for 8 weeks, while following the Mediterranean diet, is not more effective for improving ulcerative colitis symptom severity than following the Mediterranean diet without supplemental resveratrol ( 113339 ). more Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Intranasal resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in preschool children with recurrent wheezing following URTI, but without atopy, shows that using an intranasal solution containing resveratrol 0.05% and carboxymethyl-beta-glucan 0.33% (Linfovir Plus, Noos srl, Rome, Italy) 3 times daily for 7 days starting with the onset of upper respiratory symptoms reduces wheezing days and episodes but not the incidence of URTI when compared with placebo ( 115961 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to resveratrol, carboxymethyl-beta-glucan, or the combination. more More evidence is needed to rate resveratrol for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used in amounts found in foods ( 2030 ).

Typical daily intakes for adults range from 40-400 mg ( 101471 ). Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts. Taurine 2-4 grams daily in two or three divided doses has been used safely in studies lasting up to 3 months ( 5248 , 5271 , 8217 , 8221 , 10454 , 77147 , 95612 , 98337 , 104165 , 104167 ). Higher doses of taurine 6 grams daily have been used safely in studies lasting up to 4 weeks ( 98336 , 98337 ).

The duration of therapy depends on the condition being treated. Doses of up to 6 grams daily have been used for up to one year. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Concomitant use of taurine supplements or taurine-containing energy drinks with alcohol should be avoided if possible. Some research suggests that consuming taurine might increase alcohol consumption, potentially increasing the risk for alcohol poisoning ( 101471 ). Children Oral: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Standardization &amp; Formulation Energy drinks typically contain taurine 750-1000 mg per serving ( 101471 ).

Taurine is thought to have diuretic properties ( 3647 ), which might reduce the excretion of lithium. more</data><data key="mechanism_text">General Taurine is a non-essential amino acid also known as 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. It is found in high levels in protein-rich foods, such as meat, fish, and eggs, as well as in breast milk. Taurine is normally synthesized in the human body in adequate amounts by oxidation and decarboxylation of cysteine ( 5280 , 101473 ). Taurine is important in several metabolic processes in the body, including stabilizing cell membranes in electrically active tissues, such as the brain and heart, and supporting proliferation of neural progenitor cells and synapse formation in the brain. It is found in high concentrations in the developing brain, and also in the adult hippocampus, cerebellum, and hypothalamus ( 101471 ). Taurine also has functions in the gallbladder, eyes, and blood vessels, and may have some antioxidant and detoxifying properties. Taurine is also a vasorelaxant in the retina ( 77106 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Taurine has been shown to ameliorate inflammation in vitro and in vivo ( 77090 , 103213 ). In cellular research, taurine inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 ( 77155 ). A similar reduction in IL-6 has been seen clinically ( 77187 ), although conflicting research exists ( 103209 , 110576 ). In humans, taurine down-regulates inflammatory mediators, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and malondialdehyde (MDA), protecting and regenerating damaged tissue ( 77099 , 103209 , 110576 ). However, research related to the effect of taurine on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha has mixed results ( 103209 , 110576 ). Antiallergy effects In a mouse model of allergic rhinitis, taurine ameliorated the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis, likely through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects ( 103213 ). Antidiabetic effects In animal research, intraperitoneal administration of taurine dose-dependently attenuated streptozotocin-induced elevations in blood glucose ( 77162 ). In humans, plasma taurine levels have been found to be lower in people with type 2 diabetes than in controls, and they are lowest in those with type 2 diabetes who also have neuropathy ( 101473 ). Taurine is thought to act on beta cell secretion and to interfere with insulin signaling pathways. In animals it improves glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia ( 101473 ). Antiemetic effects The inhibitory effect of taurine on nausea and vomiting may result from its neuroprotective or inhibitory neurotransmitter actions. At the presynaptic site, taurine may inhibit voltage gated calcium channels and/or open the chloride channels and suppress the release of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate. It may also increase K+ efflux to decrease the postsynaptic depolarization. Taurine may also act as an inhibitory neurotransmitter to lead to a reduction of nausea and vomiting ( 91512 ). Taurine displays inhibitory activity in the olfactory bulb by decreasing excitability and modulating release of GABA. GABA acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in taste buds, and taurine acts as an agonist for GABA receptors. Therefore, taurine may play a role in decreasing taste sensation and improving hypergeusia. Taurine may also help reduce bitter tastes ( 91512 ). Antiepileptic effects Possible mechanisms for an antiepileptic effect of taurine include modulation of calcium homeostasis ( 77060 , 77261 ), prevention of glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity ( 77171 ), establishing equilibrium between inhibitory and excitatory brain processes ( 77144 ), or activating GABA-A receptors ( 77063 , 77072 , 77219 ). The results of preliminary studies using taurine in humans with epilepsy are mixed, which could be due to variable penetration of taurine into the brain ( 77059 , 77232 , 77240 , 77243 , 77252 ). Antihypertensive effects An inverse correlation between plasma taurine levels and systolic blood pressure has been reported ( 101473 ). Taurine inhibits sympathetic nervous system activity, dilates blood vessels, and suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( 77229 , 101473 ). In laboratory studies, taurine significantly upregulates expression of cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase in human mesenteric arteries. This increases production of hydrogen sulfide, resulting in vascular relaxation via inhibition of calcium influx ( 95614 ). Antineoplastic effect In cellular research, taurine inhibited doxorubicin efflux from M5076 tumor cells and decreased the weight of tumors by 40% compared to doxorubicin alone ( 77148 ). Antioxidant effects In preliminary research in vitro, taurine has demonstrated both direct and indirect antioxidant activity, via the scavenging of reactive oxygen species and the stabilization of membrane permeability, respectively ( 77112 , 77118 ). In cancer cells, taurine has been shown to scavenge oxidant and cytotoxic agents, thus protecting against carcinogenesis ( 77191 ). Various clinical studies also suggest that taurine has antioxidant effects ( 77107 , 77192 , 103209 ). In one observational study, plasma taurine levels have been linked to improvements in oxidative stress makers in people taking hypolipidemic agents, possibly due to reduced superoxide anion production at the respiratory chain level ( 77192 ). In another human study, lipoperoxidation following coronary artery bypass grafting was reduced by taurine, indicating that it may be a free-radical scavenger ( 77107 ). In patients with type 2 diabetes, taurine 1000 mg three times daily for 8 weeks increased the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase when compared with placebo ( 103209 ). Antitoxin effects In preclinical research, taurine prevents methamphetamine-induced developmental angiogenesis defects, possibly due to its antioxidant effects ( 77198 ). Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytoprotective, osmoregulatory, and membrane stabilizing effects of taurine may contribute to its protective effects against toxicity of drugs and other compounds ( 77205 ). Antiulcer effects In individuals with Helicobacter pylori-induced duodenal ulcers, adjunct taurine (Dibicor) contributes to eradication of H. pylori, shortening of duodenal scarring time, improvement in KI-67, BCL-2 expression, and stimulation of apoptotic activity of epitheliocytes compared with conventional omeprazole and antibiotic treatment alone ( 77145 ). Athletic performance enhancement effects Some evidence from animal research suggests that the quantity of taurine in the muscle tissue may impact exercise performance. The mechanism for this activity may involve reduction of oxidative stress, increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the muscle interstitial space, and the stabilization and hyperexcitement of the cell membrane. Additional research suggests that taurine may influence the amount of energy provided by the glycolytic pathway during high-intensity exercise, reducing blood lactate accumulation during exercise and improving anaerobic capacity ( 95613 ). Biliary effects Taurine seems to stimulate bile acid synthesis ( 3467 ). Cardiovascular effects Taurine has been explored as a potential preventative factor for various cardiovascular conditions ( 3467 ), including coronary heart disease ( 77146 , 77169 ), cardiac remodeling ( 77150 ), and ischemic disease ( 77111 , 77128 ), due in part to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, bile acid-conjugating, blood pressure-regulating, and intracellular calcium-modulating activities. Taurine might also lower blood pressure and might normalize excessive sympathetic nervous system activity that often occurs in people with hypertension and heart failure ( 3467 , 8219 , 8221 , 8222 ). It also has an inotropic effect on cardiac myocytes and increases stroke volume ( 101475 ). Additionally, taurine seems to modestly lower the heart rate in patients with cardiovascular or other metabolic disorders ( 114794 ). Decreased and increased heart rate and increased blood pressure have been reported following the co-administration of taurine and caffeine in human research ( 77088 , 112268 ). Decreased and increased heart rate and increased blood pressure have been reported following the co-administration of taurine and caffeine in human research ( 77088 , 112268 ). The concentration of taurine increases in the left ventricle of patients with CHF ( 9900 ). Preliminary studies also suggest taurine might have natriuretic and diuretic activity ( 3467 ). Despite evidence of taurine's possible cardioprotective effects, some conflicting evidence exists. One observational study in patients suffering from cardiac arrest has found that patients with serum taurine levels in the upper quartile have around 4-fold higher odds of in-hospital mortality when compared with patients with taurine levels in the lower three quartiles ( 103208 ). Another study in young healthy adults suggests that taurine taken as part of an energy drink impairs endothelial cell function, decreases velocities of carotid arteries, and reduces cardiac output but does not seem to impact electrocardiogram parameters ( 112268 ). In an animal model, heart perfusion with higher doses of taurine shortens cardiac repolarization, QT interval, and ventricular effective refractory periods, facilitating re-entry and leading to an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. Researchers theorize that this mechanism may give insight into fatal outcomes secondary to intoxication with energy drinks reported in humans ( 112267 ). Effects in traumatic brain injury (TBI) Taurine levels increase in the brain in response to stress and it is released from swollen cells as normal volumes are re-established in people with TBI. Taurine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with TBI almost double, then return to baseline within 3 days ( 101471 ). GABA modulating effects Taurine stimulates action potentials in GABAergic neurons, specifically targeting GABA-A receptors ( 101471 ). It has been suggested that effects of taurine on GABA receptors may contribute to seizures occurring after consumption of taurine-containing energy drinks. Taurine may decrease expression of beta 2/3 subunits of GABA receptors, lowering the seizure threshold ( 77196 ). Hormonal effects In preliminary human research, a supplement containing taurine and other ingredients taken before exercise increased the post-exercise serum concentration of growth hormone ( 46700 , 77122 ). Hypersensitivity Taurine can be metabolized to sulfites, acetaldehyde, and aminoacetaldehyde which may cause hypersensitivity-type reactions ( 91514 ). Lipid metabolism effects In healthy people, taurine seems to reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein, but increases very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol ( 77061 , 77114 , 77258 ). Studies have shown both increases and decreases in serum triglycerides ( 77076 , 77114 , 77258 ). These effects may be mediated by an effect of taurine on lipoprotein lipase. In people with liver injury, taurine decreases total cholesterol and triglycerides ( 77114 ). Muscle effects Taurine has been reported to decrease oxidative stress. It is possible that it prevents increases in carbonyl protein and lipoperoxide levels which contribute to muscle soreness ( 91513 ). Thermoregulatory effects In tests where cycling in a hot environment (35°C, 40% relative humidity) is continued to exhaustion, taurine slows the rise in core temperature and increases sweating rate at the end of the test by about 13%. Its vasodilatory effects may be contributing to heat dissipation, and it also seems to have central effects. It acts as an agonist at GABA-A receptors in the hypothalamus, affecting thermoregulation ( 101475 ).</data><data key="scientific_name">2-Aminoethane sulfonic acid</data><data key="name">Taurine</data><data key="overview_text">Taurine is often referred to as a non-essential amino acid, but it is actually an amino sulfonic acid. It is present in normal diets, with the highest levels found in meat, seafood, and eggs. Taurine can also be synthesized through oxidation and decarboxylation of cysteine in the liver. Amounts supplied by a typical Western diet range from 40-400 mg daily. Taurine is also a common ingredient in energy drinks.</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Congestive heart failure (CHF). Oral taurine may improve left ventricular function, heart failure-related symptoms, and exercise capacity in patients with CHF. A meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with heart failure shows that taking taurine 0.5-6 grams daily for up to 1 year modestly improves heart failure severity when compared with placebo ( 114794 , 114796 ). However, the validity of this study limited by high heterogeneity. In individual studies, taking taurine 2-6 grams in two or three divided doses daily for 6-8 weeks seems to improve left ventricular function ( 5248 , 5271 , 8221 ) and symptoms of heart failure ( 5271 , 5306 , 8221 ) when compared with placebo or coenzyme Q10 in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV. Also, taking taurine 500 mg three times daily for 2 weeks seems to improve exercise capacity when compared with placebo in patients with heart failure ( 77176 ). Some patients with severe heart failure rapidly improve from NYHA class IV to II after 4-8 weeks of treatment. Improvement seems to continue for as long as taurine treatment is continued, up to one year ( 5306 , 8217 , 8218 , 8221 ). more Hepatitis. Oral taurine may improve liver function in patients with acute or chronic hepatitis. Several small clinical trials show that taking taurine 1.5-4 grams daily for up to 3 months improves liver function in patients with acute and chronic hepatitis when compared with placebo ( 10454 , 77114 , 77147 ). more Possibly Ineffective Obesity. Oral taurine does not appear to improve body weight in adults who are obese or overweight. A meta-analysis of 12 small clinical trials shows that taurine supplementation does not reduce body weight or body mass index (BMI) when compared with placebo. The studies included in this analysis evaluated taurine doses of 0.5-6 grams daily for 15 days to 6 months. Most of the patient populations evaluated in the included studies had liver or metabolic disorders; three studies specifically evaluated overweight or obese adults ( 104166 ). Additionally, a more recent clinical trial in a small group of females with obesity shows that taking taurine 1 gram three times daily along with a calorie-restricted diet for 8 weeks does not reduce body weight, BMI, or waist circumference when compared with calorie restriction alone ( 104167 ). In contrast, a very small study in adults with type 2 diabetes on antidiabetes medication shows that taking taurine 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces body mass, BMI, and body fat percentage when compared with control ( 112271 ). The validity of these effects is limited by the small sample size. more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Academic performance. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial to improve academic performance. A very small clinical study in college entrance examinees over age 19 shows that taking a jelly containing taurine 3 grams daily for 14 days does not improve academic achievement when compared with baseline or placebo ( 110579 ). Due to its small size, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although there has been interest in using oral taurine for AMD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of taurine for this purpose. Androgenic alopecia. Oral taurine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with androgenic alopecia or telogen effluvium shows that taking a combination product containing taurine, cysteine, methionine, iron, selenium, and hydrolyzed collagen (GFM Oral, Cantabria Labs) along with conventional therapy, consisting primarily of finasteride or minoxidil, daily for 12 weeks improves hair loss when compared with conventional therapy alone ( 111636 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to taurine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Athletic performance. Research on the use of taurine for improving endurance or power output is limited and conflicting; however, it may improve performance by a small amount in some athletes. Research is conflicting on the effects of taurine on athletic performance. Several clinical studies in trained and untrained athletes show that taking taurine 1-6 grams as a single dose before endurance exercise, or 3 grams daily for 8 weeks after endurance exercise, does not improve endurance or aerobic capacity when compared with placebo ( 77159 , 77203 , 95613 , 98334 ). However, a meta-analysis of 7 small clinical trials shows that taking taurine 1-6 grams daily for up to 2 weeks slightly improves endurance when compared with control. Also, preliminary studies in male cyclists, recreationally active males, Olympic-level athletes, and female athletes habituated to caffeine show that taking taurine 50 mg/kg or 1-6 grams one time 1.5-2 hours prior to a cycling test increases the time to exhaustion and peak, mean, and minimum power output but does not improve perceived exertion, fatigue index, heart rate, or anaerobic capacity when compared with placebo ( 101475 , 103211 , 112265 , 112269 ). The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear; the meta-analysis did not identify a dose or duration-related benefit. One small clinical trial shows that taking taurine 40 mg/kg improves muscle power in caffeine-deprived athletes who regularly use caffeine, but actually seems to worsen muscle power in athletes who do not regularly use caffeine ( 98335 ). Overall, it is not clear which population is most likely to benefit from taurine use ( 98337 , 98338 ). Study results are mixed when taurine has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One small study shows that taking a specific product containing taurine and caffeine (AdvoCare Spark) does not improve sprint performance in college athletes when compared with placebo ( 77195 ). However, other small studies of cyclists and boxers suggest that taking taurine in combination with a variety of other ingredients including B vitamins, caffeine, and glucuronolactone (Red Bull Energy Drink) or ginseng, kudzu, and soybean, may improve measures such as endurance, power, balance, or agility ( 37815 , 57945 , 110577 , 112269 ). It is unclear if the benefits seen in these studies are due to taurine, other ingredients, or the combinations. more Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there has been interest in using oral taurine for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of taurine for this purpose. Autism spectrum disorder. Although there has been interest in using oral taurine for autism spectrum disorder, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of taurine for this purpose. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with CINV. One small clinical trial in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving 6 months of chemotherapy shows that taking taurine (pure powder, Aviforme) 1000 mg twice daily, starting 6 hours after receiving chemotherapeutic agents, significantly improves CINV in 87.5% of patients. Other symptoms, such as reduced appetite and smell and taste impairment, are also improved in some patients ( 91512 ). more Chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for preventing or treating chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. One small clinical trial in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving 6 months of chemotherapy shows that taking taurine (pure powder, Aviforme) 1000 mg twice daily reduces plasma creatinine, urea, bilirubin, and liver enzymes after 4 months when compared with placebo. This suggests a protective effect against chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. A reduction in overall fatigue is also observed ( 95616 ). more Cirrhosis. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with cirrhosis. One small, uncontrolled clinical study in patients with cirrhosis shows that taking taurine 1 gram three times daily for 4 weeks reduces the severity and frequency of muscle cramps when compared to baseline ( 104165 ). Another small clinical trial in patients with cirrhosis shows that taking taurine 6 grams daily for 4 weeks reduces portal hypertension by 12%, compared with a 2% increase in the placebo group ( 98336 ). However, it is unclear if this is associated with a reduced risk for complications such as variceal bleeding and ascites. more Cognitive function. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for improving cognitive function; however, taking an energy drink (Red Bull Energy Drink) containing taurine and other ingredients may modestly improve some measures of cognitive function. Levels of taurine decrease with age, but supplementation does not seem to have neuroprotective effects or cognitive benefits in the elderly ( 101471 , 110574 , 110578 ). In one small crossover study, taurine alone did not reduce errors in sleep-deprived individuals when compared with placebo ( 38154 ). However, taurine taken as part of an energy drink formulation containing taurine, caffeine, glucuronolactone, and B vitamins (Red Bull Energy Drink) improves focused and sustained attention, wakefulness, verbal reasoning, driving ability and quality, and reaction speed when compared with placebo ( 9899 , 38117 , 77088 , 77202 ). Preliminary clinical research in young adults also shows that consuming the Red Bull Energy Drink might improve attention and verbal reasoning, but does not seem to improve memory, when compared with placebo ( 9899 , 77088 ). more Critical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with critical illness. A meta-analysis of small clinical trials including adults in the intensive care unit (ICU) shows that receiving enteral nutrition enhanced with taurine for 5-14 days does not reduce mortality or shorten ICU length of stay when compared with control. Taurine was added to enteral nutrition at doses of 30-50 mg/kg or 10 mg total daily ( 114795 ). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Cystic fibrosis. Oral taurine may reduce steatorrhea in children with cystic fibrosis, but it does not seem to improve other measures of nutritional status. Some small clinical studies in children with cystic fibrosis show that taking taurine 30-40 mg/kg daily for 7 days to 6 months might be useful as adjunctive therapy to reduce steatorrhea when compared with baseline or placebo ( 10455 , 77227 , 77231 ). However, it does not seem to improve growth, lung function, muscle protein breakdown, or other symptoms of cystic fibrosis (77224 ,77228). Also, adding taurine 500-1500 mg daily to treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid for up to one year does not improve liver function tests, fat absorption, or nutritional status in patients with cystic fibrosis and associated liver disease when compared with ursodeoxycholic acid alone ( 77246 , 77256 ). more Delirium. It is unclear if oral taurine prevents delirium in patients in the intensive care unit. A large clinical study of hospitalized adults in Iran who underwent liver transplantation shows that taking a specific taurine powder product (100% Taurine Amino Acid, MyProtein) 2 grams daily for 30 days post-transplant reduces the risk of delirium by 73% when compared with placebo. These results also suggest that for every four patients treated with taurine over placebo, one additional case of delirium is prevented. Patients who took taurine also had less time on the ventilator and shorter intensive care and hospital stays ( 110575 ). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to taurine or other factors since ventilator time and intensive care length of stay are risk factors for delirium. more Diabetes. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with diabetes. Plasma levels of taurine are reported to be lower in patients with diabetes than in healthy controls ( 101473 ). However, clinical research evaluating taurine for glycemic control is mixed ( 77074 , 103212 ). One small clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking taurine 1 gram three times daily for 8 weeks reduces blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo ( 103212 ). Although there was no improvement in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), the study duration was not long enough to detect a meaningful reduction in HbA1c. Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking taurine 1-1.5 grams twice daily for 2-4 months does not affect fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, or insulin but may improve measures of insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo ( 77074 , 112271 ). However, taking taurine while following an exercise program 3 times weekly does appear to reduce fasting blood sugar and HbA1c when compared with exercise plus placebo ( 112271 ). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear; however, all the included studies were small and potentially inadequately powered to detect a difference in outcomes. A meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with diabetes and other metabolic disorders shows that taking taurine 0.5-6 grams orally daily for up to 1 year reduces fasting blood glucose by approximately 6 mg/mL, when compared with placebo ( 114796 ). However, many of the studies included patients who did not have diabetes. The validity of this study is also limited by high heterogeneity. more Epilepsy. Although there has been interest in using oral taurine for epilepsy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of taurine for this condition. Erectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with erectile dysfunction. An open-label clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate ED shows that taking a specific combination supplement (Icarifil, Anvest Health S.p.A) containing taurine 50 mg, panax ginseng , L-carnitine, L-citrulline, tribulus, and other ingredients orally daily for 3 months improves patient-reported erectile function when compared to baseline. Additionally, taking the supplement with tadalafil improves some, but not all, patient-reported assessments of erectile function when compared with taking tadalafil alone ( 114989 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to taurine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Exercise-induced muscle soreness. Small clinical studies suggest that oral taurine may modestly improve exercise-induced muscle soreness. One small clinical trial in healthy, untrained adults shows that taking taurine 2 grams in combination with branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) three times daily for 2 weeks reduces subjective muscle soreness by 37% when compared with placebo ( 77212 ). Another small clinical trial in young, untrained males shows that taking taurine (Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., LTD.) 2 grams three times daily after meals before exercise, and continuing for three days after exercise, reduces delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), but not creatine kinase levels, when compared with placebo ( 91513 ). more Fatigue. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for improving fatigue. One small clinical trial shows that taurine seems to reduce fatigue when taken alone, but increases fatigue when taken in combination with caffeine ( 77202 ). However, an observational study in young adults has found that subjective scores for physical and mental fatigue do not seem to correlate with dietary taurine intake ( 101472 ). One small clinical trial shows that drinking 500 mL of an energy drink providing taurine 1 gram plus other ingredients including caffeine and B vitamins decreases measures of driving-related fatigue in a driving simulation when compared with placebo ( 91075 ). more Helicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral taurine can aid in the eradication of helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). One clinical trial shows that taking taurine 500 mg twice daily in combination with conventional treatment for 6 weeks increases H. pylori eradication and shortens duodenal ulcer scarring time in patients with confirmed H. pylori infection when compared with conventional treatment alone ( 77145 ). more Hyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for lowering lipid levels. A meta-analysis of 12 small clinical trials in adults with various liver or metabolic disorders, but without a specific diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, shows that taurine supplementation reduces total cholesterol by 11 mg/dL and triglycerides by 13 mg/dL, but does not seem to improve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo. The studies included in this analysis evaluated doses of 0.5-6 grams daily for 15 days to 6 months ( 104166 ). Another meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with various cardiovascular and metabolic disorders shows that taking taurine 0.5-6 grams orally daily for up to 1 year reduces triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by approximately 18 mg/dL and 6 mg/dL, respectively, when compared with placebo. Taking taurine did not affect high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ( 114796 ). However, many of the studies included patients who did not have hyperlipidemia. The validity of this study is also limited by high heterogeneity. The benefits of taurine in adults with hyperlipidemia are unclear. The effect of taurine has also been investigated in combination with exercise. A very small study in adults with type 2 diabetes on antidiabetes medication shows that taking taurine 500 mg twice daily while participating in an exercise program 3 times weekly for 8 weeks reduces triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol when compared with exercise plus placebo ( 112271 ). more Hypertension. Oral taurine may modestly reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension; however, the long-term antihypertensive effects of taurine are unclear. One clinical study in patients with elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension shows that taking taurine 1.6 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 3 mmHg when compared with placebo. The benefit is seen after 8 weeks of continued supplementation ( 95614 ). A small clinical trial in patients with stage 2 hypertension (previously classified as borderline hypertension) shows that taking taurine 6 grams daily for 7 days reduces both SBP and DBP when compared to baseline ( 77229 ). The long-term effects of taurine on blood pressure are unclear. A meta-analysis of 12 small clinical trials in adults with various liver or metabolic disorders, but without a specific hypertension diagnosis, shows that taurine supplementation reduces SBP by 5 mmHg and DBP by 3 mmHg when compared with placebo. The studies included in this analysis evaluated doses of 0.5-6 grams daily for 15 days to 6 months ( 104166 ). Two meta-analyses of clinical trials in patients with cardiovascular and other metabolic disorders show that taking taurine 0.5-6 grams orally daily for up to 1 year reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by approximately 4 mmHg and 2 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 114794 , 114796 ). However, many of the studies included patients who did not have hypertension. The validity of this study is also limited by high heterogeneity. Taurine is commonly found in energy drinks, and its effect on blood pressure when used in combination with other ingredients in the form of an energy drink has been evaluated. A small observational study in young adults suggests that drinking a specific combination product containing taurine 100 mg, caffeine, and group B vitamins (Redbull Energy Drink) reduces heart rate but does not change SBP or DBP when compared to baseline ( 112266 ). However, another small observational study in young healthy adults suggests that drinking a specific combination product containing taurine 2000 mg, caffeine, ginseng, glucuronolactone, inositol, guarana, L-carnitine, and B vitamins (Monster Energy Drink) increases both SBP and DBP by about 16 mmHg and raises heart rate by 17 beats per minute 15 minutes after consumption when compared to baseline. However, 90 minutes after consumption only DBP and heart rate remain elevated ( 112268 ). In both studies, the validity of the effects is limited by a lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if the effects are due to taurine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Infant development. Higher maternal intake of taurine from the diet may be linked to increased newborn length and weight; however, feeding taurine-containing formula to newborns does not appear to improve infant development. One observational study has found a positive correlation between maternal dietary taurine intake and newborn length. In pregnant patients with high taurine intake (&gt;120 mg/day), neonatal birth weight and length were significantly higher when compared with groups with lower taurine intake ( 101474 ). However, clinical research shows that administering infant formula containing taurine 45 mg/L for up to 12 weeks does not affect weight, length, head circumference, or behavior in preterm and full-term infants when compared with formula without taurine ( 77119 , 77216 , 77218 , 77239 , 77260 ). more Iron deficiency anemia. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with iron deficiency anemia. One small clinical trial in females with iron deficiency anemia shows that taking taurine 1000 mg plus ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily for 20 weeks improves hemoglobin concentrations, red blood cell counts, and serum ferritin levels when compared with ferrous sulfate plus placebo ( 77070 ). more Muscular dystrophy. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with muscular dystrophy. One very small crossover trial in patients with muscular dystrophy shows that taking taurine 100-150 mg/kg for 6 months improves the ability to relax muscles after voluntary use when compared with placebo ( 77235 ). more Physical performance. It is unclear if oral taurine improves physical performance in older adults. A small study in elderly females living in a care facility shows that taking taurine powder 1.5 grams daily for 14 weeks in addition to standardized exercise training may modestly improve some measures of physical fitness (i.e. agility, endurance) when compared to baseline. These measures were not improved in patients who took taurine but did not participate in exercise training or who participated in exercise training but did not take taurine ( 110574 ). The validity of these findings is limited by lack of randomization, blinding, and statistical comparison between groups. more Postoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for improving postoperative recovery. One small clinical trial in patients recovering from surgery after a hip fracture shows that taking taurine 6 grams daily for 7 days after surgery does not improve morbidity and mortality outcomes after 1 year when compared with placebo ( 95615 ). more Psychosis. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with psychosis. One small clinical trial in adults up to 25 years of age with first-episode psychosis shows that taking taurine 4 grams daily for 12 weeks in combination with prescribed antipsychotics reduces positive psychotic symptoms, but not negative or cognitive symptoms, when compared with placebo ( 95612 ). more Sleep deprivation. Oral taurine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination product containing taurine, caffeine, glucuronolactone, and B vitamins (Red Bull Energy Drink) reduces lane drifting and sleepiness and improves driving quality and reaction time during a car-driving simulator exercise in sleep-deprived individuals when compared with placebo ( 38117 , 77066 ). Other preliminary clinical research in sleep-deprived surgical trainees shows that taking taurine 2 grams in addition to caffeine 150 mg improves reaction time during performance of simulated laparoscopic surgery when compared with placebo, although error-making is not reduced ( 38154 ). more Tourette syndrome. Oral taurine may improve tic severity in children with Tourette syndrome who are taking tiapride at a dose of 300 mg or less. Taurine may not be effective in children taking higher doses of tiapride. One clinical trial in children 6-16 years of age with Tourette syndrome or other tic disorders shows that taking taurine along with tiapride reduces the severity of tics when compared with tiapride alone. For every 6 children taking taurine, one additional child saw a 60% or greater reduction in tic severity as measured on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale when compared with placebo. However, taurine did not improve tic severity in children taking tiapride at a dose greater than 300 mg daily ( 103210 ). Taurine was taken in age-dependent doses of 2.4 grams daily in those 6-8 years, 3.6 grams daily in those 9-13 years, and 4.8 grams daily in those 14-16 years. more Traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with a TBI. A small clinical study of adults in Iran receiving treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) following TBI shows that adding a specific taurine powder product (Nutricost) 30 mg/kg/day up to 3 grams daily to enteral nutrition for 14 days may modestly improve disease severity scores, but does not reduce days on the ventilator, ICU length of stay, or mortality at 30 days when compared with usual enteral nutrition ( 110573 ). Due to its small size, this study may have been underpowered to detect differences between groups. more More evidence is needed to rate taurine for these uses.</data></node>

Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Turmeric has antioxidant effects. Theoretically, this may reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals. However, research is conflicting. In vitro research suggests that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, inhibits mechlorethamine-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells by up to 70%. Also, animal research shows that curcumin inhibits cyclophosphamide-induced tumor regression ( 96126 ). However, some in vitro research shows that curcumin does not affect the apoptosis capacity of etoposide. Also, other laboratory research suggests that curcumin might augment the cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents. Reasons for the discrepancies may relate to the dose of curcumin and the specific chemotherapeutic agent. Lower doses of curcumin might have antioxidant effects while higher doses might have pro-oxidant effects ( 96125 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, turmeric might have on alkylating agents. more AMLODIPINE (Norvasc) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Taking turmeric with amlodipine may increase levels of amlodipine. Animal research shows that giving amlodipine 1 mg/kg as a single dose following the use of turmeric extract 200 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks increases the maximum concentration and area under the curve by 53% and 56%, respectively, when compared with amlodipine alone ( 107113 ). Additional animal research shows that taking amlodipine 1 mg/kg with a curcumin 2 mg/kg pretreatment for 10 days increases the maximum concentration and area under the curve by about 2-fold when compared with amlodipine alone ( 103099 ). more ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Turmeric may have antiplatelet effects and may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. However, research is conflicting. Curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, has demonstrated antiplatelet effects in vitro ( 11143 , 81204 , 81271 ). Furthermore, two case reports have found that taking turmeric along with warfarin or fluindione was associated with an increased international normalized ratio (INR) ( 89718 , 100906 ). However, one clinical study in healthy volunteers shows that taking curcumin 500 mg daily for 3 weeks, alone or with aspirin 100 mg, does not increase antiplatelet effects or bleeding risk ( 96137 ). It is possible that the dose of turmeric used in this study was too low to produce a notable effect. more ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, taking turmeric with antidiabetes drugs might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Animal research and case reports suggest that curcumin, a turmeric constituent, can reduce blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes ( 79692 , 79984 , 80155 , 80313 , 80315 , 80476 , 80553 , 81048 , 81219 ). Furthermore, clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking curcumin 475 mg daily for 10 days prior to taking glyburide 5 mg decreased postprandial glucose levels for up to 24 hours when compared with glyburide alone, despite the lack of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction ( 96133 ). Other clinical studies in patients with diabetes show that taking curcumin daily can reduce blood glucose levels when compared with placebo ( 104149 , 114898 , 114900 ). more ANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Turmeric has antioxidant effects. Theoretically, this may reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals. However, research is conflicting. In vitro and animal research shows that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, inhibits doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells by up to 65% ( 96126 ). However, curcumin does not seem to affect the apoptosis capacity of daunorubicin. In fact, some research shows that curcumin might augment the cytotoxic effects of antitumor antibiotics, increasing their effectiveness. Reasons for the discrepancies may relate to the dose of curcumin and the chemotherapeutic agent. Lower doses of curcumin might have antioxidant effects while higher doses might have pro-oxidant effects ( 96125 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effects, if any, antioxidants such as turmeric have on antitumor antibiotics. more CYTOCHROME P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase or decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1A1. However, research is conflicting. Most in vitro and animal research suggests that the turmeric constituent, curcumin, INHIBITS CYP1A1, primarily in the liver ( 15823 , 21495 , 80876 , 81411 ). However, some evidence from in vitro research suggests that curcumin may INDUCE CYP1A1 in the intestines ( 21500 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2. However, research is conflicting. In vitro and animal research show that the turmeric constituent, curcumin, inhibits CYP1A2 ( 15823 , 21497 , 81304 ). However, other in vitro research suggests that curcumin does not significantly affect CYP1A2 ( 22000 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Turmeric might increase or decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. In vitro and animal research show that turmeric and its constituents curcumin and curcuminoids inhibit CYP3A4 ( 21497 , 21498 , 21499 ). Also, 8 case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describe increased toxicity in patients taking turmeric and cancer medications that are CYP3A4 substrates, including everolimus, ruxolitinib, ibrutinib, and palbociclib, and bortezomib ( 111644 ). In another case report, a transplant patient presented with acute nephrotoxicity and elevated tacrolimus levels after consuming turmeric powder at a dose of 15 or more spoonfuls daily for ten days prior. It was thought that turmeric increased levels of tacrolimus due to CYP3A4 inhibition ( 93544 ). Conversely, other in vitro research suggests that turmeric induces CYP3A4 activity, leading to reduced levels of CYP3A4 substrates ( 111404 ). An animal model suggests that induction of CYP3A4 occurs after daily curcumin use for 1 week ( 116945 ). However, the induction of CYP3A4 by turmeric has not been reported in humans. more DOCETAXEL (Taxotere) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase blood levels of oral docetaxel. Animal research suggests that the turmeric constituent, curcumin, enhances the oral bioavailability of docetaxel ( 80999 ). However, the significance of this interaction is unclear, as this drug is typically administered intravenously in clinical settings. more ESTROGENS Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, large amounts of turmeric might interfere with hormone replacement therapy through competition for estrogen receptors. In vitro research shows that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, displaces the binding of estrogen to its receptors ( 21486 ). more GLYBURIDE (Diabeta, others) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, taking turmeric and glyburide in combination might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Clinical research shows that taking curcumin 475 mg daily for 10 days prior to taking glyburide 5 mg increases blood levels of glyburide by 12% at 2 hours after the dose in patients with type 2 diabetes. While maximal blood concentrations of glyburide were not affected, turmeric modestly decreased postprandial glucose levels for up to 24 hours when compared to glyburide alone, possibly due to the hypoglycemic effect of turmeric demonstrated in animal research ( 96133 ). more HEPATOTOXIC DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, turmeric might increase the risk of liver damage when taken with hepatotoxic drugs. There is concern that turmeric might cause hepatotoxicity, especially when highly bioavailable formulations are used in high doses ( 103633 , 107122 , 109288 , 110221 ). more LOSARTAN (Cozaar) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase the effects of losartan. Research in hypertensive rats shows that taking turmeric can increase the hypotensive effects of losartan ( 110897 ). more METHOTREXATE (Trexall, others) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, turmeric might have additive effects when used with hepatotoxic drugs such as methotrexate. In one case report, a 39-year-old female taking methotrexate, turmeric, and linseed oil developed hepatotoxicity ( 111644 ). more NORFLOXACIN (Noroxin) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase the effects and adverse effects of norfloxacin. Animal research shows that taking curcumin, a turmeric constituent, can increase blood levels of orally administered norfloxacin ( 80863 ). more ORGANIC ANION-TRANSPORTING POLYPEPTIDE SUBSTRATES (OATP) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase blood levels of OATP4C1 substrates. In vitro research shows that the turmeric constituent curcumin competitively inhibits OATP4C1 transport. This transporter is expressed in the kidney and facilitates the renal excretion of certain drugs ( 113337 ). Theoretically, taking turmeric might decrease renal excretion of OATP substrates. more P-GLYCOPROTEIN SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase the absorption of P-glycoprotein substrates. In vitro and animal research shows that curcuminoids and other constituents found in turmeric can inhibit P-glycoprotein expression and activity ( 21472 , 21473 , 21474 , 21475 , 21476 , 21477 , 21478 , 21479 , 21480 )( 21482 , 21484 , 111644 ). more PACLITAXEL (Abraxane, Onxol) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might alter blood levels of paclitaxel, although any effect may not be clinically relevant. Clinical research in adults with breast cancer receiving intravenous paclitaxel suggests that taking turmeric may modestly alter paclitaxel pharmacokinetics. Patients received paclitaxel on day 1, followed by either no treatment or turmeric 2 grams daily from days 2-22. Pharmacokinetic modeling suggests that turmeric reduces the maximum concentration and area under the curve of paclitaxel by 12.1% and 7.7%, respectively. However, these changes are not likely to be considered clinically relevant ( 108876 ). Conversely, animal research suggests that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, enhances the oral bioavailability of paclitaxel ( 22005 ). However, the significance of this interaction is unclear, as this drug is typically administered intravenously in clinical settings. more SULFASALAZINE (Azulfidine) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Turmeric might increase the effects and adverse effects of sulfasalazine. Clinical research shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, can increase blood levels of sulfasalazine by 3.2-fold ( 81131 ). more TACROLIMUS (Prograf) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Turmeric might increase the effects and adverse effects of tacrolimus. In one case report, a transplant patient presented with acute nephrotoxicity and elevated tacrolimus levels of 29 ng/mL. The patient previously had tacrolimus levels within the therapeutic range at 9.7 ng/mL. Ten days prior to presenting at the emergency room the patient started consumption of turmeric powder at a dose of 15 or more spoonfuls daily. It was thought that turmeric increased levels of tacrolimus due to cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibition ( 93544 ). In vitro and animal research show that turmeric and its constituent curcumin inhibit CYP3A4 ( 21497 , 21498 , 21499 ). more TALINOLOL Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Turmeric may reduce the absorption of talinolol in some situations. Clinical research shows that taking curcumin for 6 days decreases the bioavailability of talinolol when taken together on the seventh day ( 80079 ). The clinical significance of this effect is unclear. more TAMOXIFEN (Nolvadex) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, turmeric might reduce the levels and clinical effects of tamoxifen. In a small clinical trial in patients with breast cancer taking tamoxifen 20-30 mg daily, adding curcumin 1200 mg plus piperine 10 mg three times daily reduces the 24-hour area under the curve of tamoxifen and the active metabolite endoxifen by 12.8% and 12.4%, respectively, as well as the maximum concentrations of tamoxifen, when compared with tamoxifen alone. However, in the absence of piperine, the area under the curve for endoxifen and the maximum concentration of tamoxifen were not significantly reduced. Effects were most pronounced in patients who were extensive cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 metabolizers ( 107123 ). more TOPOISOMERASE I INHIBITORS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Turmeric has antioxidant effects. There is some concern that this may reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals. However, research is conflicting. In vitro research shows that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, inhibits camptothecin-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells by up to 71% ( 96126 ). However, other in vitro research shows that curcumin augments the cytotoxic effects of camptothecin. Reasons for the discrepancies may relate to the dose of curcumin and the chemotherapeutic agents. Lower doses of curcumin might have antioxidant effects while higher doses might have pro-oxidant effects ( 96125 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, turmeric might have. more TRAMADOL (Ultram) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase or decrease levels of tramadol. Animal research suggests that a single dose of curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may increase tramadol's maximum concentration (Cmax) by inhibiting metabolism, while continued daily use for 7 days may reduce the area under the curve (AUC) due to the induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) ( 116945 ). However, this interaction has not been reported in humans. more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Turmeric might increase the risk of bleeding with warfarin. One case of increased international normalized ratio (INR) has been reported for a patient taking warfarin who began taking turmeric. Prior to taking turmeric, the patient had stable INR measurements. Within a few weeks of starting turmeric supplementation, the patient's INR increased to 10 ( 100906 ). Additionally, curcumin, the active constituent in turmeric, has demonstrated antiplatelet effects in vitro ( 11143 , 81204 , 81271 ), which may produce additive effects when taken with warfarin. more</data><data key="mechanism_text">General The applicable part of turmeric is the rhizome or roots. Turmeric's major active constituents are the curcuminoids ( 80713 , 80809 ), which include the polyphenol curcumin (diferuloylmethane) ( 80405 , 80434 , 80599 , 80642 , 80691 , 102345 ), demethoxycurcumin ( 80405 , 80434 , 80599 , 80642 , 80691 ), bisdemethoxycurcumin ( 80405 , 80434 , 80599 , 80642 , 80691 ), calebin, and other diarylheptanoids ( 79809 ). Turmeric rhizomes or roots also contain tumerin, tumerones ( 78963 , 79338 , 79465 , 79924 , 80125 , 102350 ) and turmeronols ( 102350 ), and sesquiterpenes ( 79124 , 79924 , 80095 , 80125 , 80454 ). Other constituents of turmeric include minerals such as iron and potassium ( 79427 , 80521 ); fatty acids, such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid ( 49742 ); and the polysaccharides ukonans A-D ( 79468 , 79587 , 81186 ). Analgesic effects Orally, turmeric and its constituent curcumin have been shown to reduce pain, particularly the late phase of pain, in animal models ( 80451 , 80511 ). Although the exact mechanism of action is not clear, some evidence from in vitro research suggests that curcumin can inhibit transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-mediated pain hypersensitivity ( 80898 ). Anti-allergy effects Human research suggests that treatment with curcumin decreases the production of inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins from monocytes and neutrophils ( 96138 ). Anti-Alzheimer effects There is preliminary evidence that curcumin might have activity in Alzheimer disease. In middle-aged and elderly adults, taking curcumin prevents measures of amyloid and/or tau accumulation in the amygdala and hypothalamus ( 96161 ). In animal models, curcumin caused disaggregation of amyloid beta, and decreased brain amyloid, plaque, and oxidized protein levels ( 17096 , 79074 , 79941 , 80080 , 80534 ). In vitro evidence suggests that curcumin reduces beta-amyloid production by inhibiting the upregulation of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which is the rate-limiting enzyme for beta-amyloid production ( 80368 , 80409 ). Other in vitro research suggests that curcuminoids increase the clearance of amyloid beta from mononuclear cells and enhance the uptake of amyloid beta by macrophages from patients with Alzheimer disease ( 79941 , 80144 , 80520 ). In addition to reducing the production and increasing the clearance of amyloid beta, in vitro and animal research also suggest that curcuminoids from turmeric protect against impairment by, or toxicity of, amyloid protein ( 79023 , 79096 , 79179 , 80913 , 81030 ). Evidence from animal research also suggests that curcuminoids have acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities ( 80469 , 80971 ). Anti-arthritic effects In human research, some research has found that curcumin inhibits levels of inflammatory markers associated with arthritis, including C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and/or the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( 96129 , 110222 ). It also has antioxidant effects ( 110222 ) and may inhibit interleukin 1-beta (IL-1-beta) stimulated inflammatory and catabolic mediators, including prostaglandin E2, IL-6, IL-8, and nitric oxide ( 102349 , 110222 ). Animal models suggest that turmeric extract reduces arthritis-associated joint inflammation by inhibiting NF-kB activation ( 79961 ). Curcumin also seems to suppress the production of matrix metalloproteinases, which are involved in cartilage degradation ( 79010 , 80787 , 102349 ). It also has a protective effect against degradation and the catabolic function of IL-1-beta, lipopolysaccharides, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in chondrocytes and cartilage ( 102349 ). Curcumin also stimulates matrix regeneration by restoring synthesis of collagen type II and glycosaminoglycan ( 102349 ). In vitro evidence suggests that turmeric rhizome extract inhibits the growth and promotes apoptosis in synovial fibroblasts, which are generally characterized by hyperplasia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( 80153 ). Also, in vitro evidence suggests that curcumin inhibits the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which is involved in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis ( 70963 ). Anti-gingivitis effects Preliminary clinical research suggests that turmeric-containing mouthwashes may help reduce gingivitis severity in patients with this condition ( 81127 , 89723 ). Potential mechanisms of action may include a reduction of the inflammatory cell infiltrate and increased collagen content and fibroblastic cell numbers ( 81062 ), inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta gene expression induced by a specific periodontopathic bacterium ( 80466 ), and inhibition of nicotine-induced ERK expression, which is involved in periodontal disease ( 79576 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Curcumin seems to have anti-inflammatory activity, possibly by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other cytokines involved in pro-inflammatory signaling pathways ( 11138 , 11139 , 11140 , 12482 , 18205 , 79251 , 79661 , 80480 , 81203 , 96139 )( 102347 , 107116 ). Curcumin also seems to inhibit inflammatory enzymes such as collagenase, elastase, and hyaluronidase ( 79251 ). Additionally, clinical research in mixed populations, including healthy adults as well as patients with a variety of comorbidities or autoimmune disorders, shows that turmeric or curcumin reduces the inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), high-sensitivity (hs)-CRP, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, the effect of turmeric or curcumin on IL-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is inconsistent ( 100260 , 106793 , 106794 , 106795 , 106804 , 107109 , 107116 , 107119 , 108873 , 108875 )( 110218 , 110219 , 111353 , 114898 , 114899 , 114900 , 114903 ). Other research in humans has found no effect of curcumin on these or other inflammatory mediators ( 105396 , 107109 , 107117 , 107119 ). Anti-lithogenic effects In humans, curcumin can induce gallbladder contractions ( 11145 , 78882 ). Theoretically, this may prevent gallstone production, as shown in animal models ( 79339 , 81094 ). Anticancer effects Turmeric exhibits chemopreventive and growth inhibitory activity against several tumor cell lines ( 79042 , 79580 , 79689 , 81110 , 81209 , 81273 , 81331 , 81349 , 81350 , 81440 ). It seems to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, possibly by upregulating p53 expression, and may inhibit angiogenesis ( 11141 , 11142 , 12482 , 81065 ). Curcumin might reduce activity of procarcinogenic eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin-E2 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), via inhibition of cyclooxygenases and 5-lipoxygenase ( 18204 , 80504 , 80834 , 80917 ). Preliminary evidence suggests curcumin can also reduce precancerous rectal aberrant crypt foci ( 18204 , 81294 ). Some laboratory evidence suggests that curcumin can inhibit the cellular pathways leading to tumor metastasis, invasion, and angiogenesis ( 96132 ). Turmeric may also reduce the carcinogenic effect of other drugs or chemicals. In animal models, benzo(a)pyrene-related CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 induction is normalized by a 1% turmeric diet, suggesting that turmeric might inhibit activation of carcinogens that are metabolized by CYP enzymes ( 15823 , 15824 ). The turmeric diet also appears to increase glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity in some tissues ( 15823 ). Antidepressant effects In humans, the antidepressant effects of curcumin were related to decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines and increased levels of serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Decreased cortisol levels also suggest the role of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis in the anti-depressant effects of curcumin ( 96139 , 114898 ). Evidence from in vitro and animal research suggests that the antidepressant effects of turmeric extract stem from its ability to inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and possibly MAO B, which leads to increased levels of serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline ( 79192 , 79652 , 79707 , 80432 ). The turmeric constituent curcumin also appears to increase adenylyl cyclase activity and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration, which has been associated with antidepressant effects ( 80607 ). Antidiabetic effects Evidence from animal and clinical research suggests that turmeric and its constituents reduce levels of glucose and HbA1c ( 79114 , 79591 , 79692 , 79970 , 79984 , 80785 , 114898 , 114900 ) and elevate plasma insulin levels ( 80785 , 81048 ), which may improve blood glucose control in diabetics. Evidence from animal models suggests that turmeric may reduce diabetic neuropathic pain by inhibiting the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) ( 79842 ). In addition to reducing diabetic neuropathic pain, turmeric may also prevent the development of diabetes-associated neuronal damage. Animal models suggest that turmeric may reduce neuronal damage associated with diabetes by reducing the expression of cerebellar proteins associated with cholinergic and insulin receptor activity, as well as glucose transport ( 80810 ). Curcuminoids from turmeric also appear to reduce diabetes-associated neuronal injury via antioxidant effects ( 80493 ). Animal models suggest that curcumin may protect against the development of diabetic nephropathy by decreasing dephosphorylation and increasing acetylation of histone H3 and attenuating the increased expression of HSP-27 and MAP kinase p38 in the diabetic kidney ( 80249 ). Curcumin may also prevent diabetes-associated kidney dysfunction by inhibiting the histone acetyltransferase p300 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) ( 80594 , 80742 ). Animal models suggest that curcumin may help prevent the development of diabetic retinopathy by inhibiting diabetes-induced increases in interleukin-1beta, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and NF-kB levels in the retina ( 80071 , 80147 ). A meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, migraine, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or kidney failure shows that nanocurcumin supplementation improves fasting blood glucose levels, but not glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), regardless of baseline fasting blood glucose levels, trial duration, or body weight. Fasting insulin levels and insulin resistance also are improved ( 106793 ). Antimicrobial effects Turmeric or its curcuminoid constituents seem to have activity against some bacteria, including Eschericia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ( 36131 , 39892 , 43458 , 51912 , 80183 , 80481 , 80569 , 80798 ). Some in vitro evidence suggests that the antibacterial action of curcumin against E. coli results from curcumin's inhibition of enoyl-ACP reductase from E. coli ( 80871 ). Other in vitro evidence suggests that curcumin inhibits the bacterial cell proliferation of Bacillus subtilis by inhibiting the assembly of FtsZ ( 80192 ). Additional in vitro evidence shows that turmeric constituents inhibit sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus cells, which prevents these cells from adhering to fibronectin; this may reduce S. aureus invasion of endothelial cells ( 79742 ). Other in vitro research shows that curcumin inhibits Ikappa B kinase-alpha and -beta and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase in Neisseria gonorrhoeae cells, which prevents the bacteria from adhering to mucosal epithelial cells ( 79637 ). Turmeric also appears to have activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ( 11140 , 79359 ), hepatitis C ( 80886 ), hepatitis B ( 79694 , 80644 ), herpes simplex ( 78899 , 80244 ), and Epstein-Barr ( 79116 , 81376 ) viruses. Also, animal models show that curcumin may have activity against the protozoan Leishmania amazonensis ( 11140 , 79309 ), Toxoplasma gondii ( 80570 ), Schistosomiasis mansoni ( 80586 ), Giardia lamblia ( 79865 ), and Plasmodium ( 79980 , 80619 , 81011 ). In vitro evidence suggests that curcumin has antiparasitic activity against Cryptosporidium parvum ( 80706 ). Antioxidant effects Preliminary research suggests that turmeric and its constituent curcumin might have antioxidant effects ( 11140 , 11147 ). Both turmeric and its constituents have been found to scavenge free radicals and phenolic oxidants and decrease levels of reactive oxygen species ( 39885 , 49430 , 71907 , 79090 , 79204 , 80370 , 102347 ). Curcumin has been shown to increase levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and other antioxidant enzymes in vitro and in animal research ( 80306 , 80370 , 80891 , 81055 , 81070 ). However, results of research in humans is mixed regarding the effect of turmeric or curcumin on levels of SOD or total antioxidant capacity, and some research shows that it reduces levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidation ( 100260 , 106804 , 109286 , 111353 , 114898 , 114899 , 114903 ). In one study, plasma vitamin E increased after 6 months of treatment with 1-4 grams/day of curcumin, possibly indicating that antioxidant effects of curcumin were sparing vitamin E ( 17096 ). Antishiga toxin effects In vitro evidence suggests that curcumin can reduce cell death associated with shiga toxin (stx)1 by enhancing expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) ( 79028 ) or blocking the binding of stx to cells ( 79903 ). Theoretically, this may contribute to the antidiarrheal effects of curcumin. Antithrombotic effects Curcumin might have antithrombotic effects. Preliminary research suggests it might inhibit platelet-activating factor and arachidonic acid platelet aggregation, possibly by interfering with thromboxane synthesis ( 11143 , 46897 , 81217 ) or by blocking TNF-alpha-induced expression of thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor ( 79578 ). Cardiovascular effects In human research, curcuminoids decrease the risk of myocardial infarction following coronary artery bypass grafting ( 81143 ). Laboratory evidence suggests that turmeric may protect against myocardial infarction by reducing inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix proteases ( 79382 , 79588 , 79607 , 80371 , 80653 , 80802 ). Other cardiovascular effects induced by turmeric in laboratory research include blood pressure reduction ( 79673 , 107113 ), vasorelaxation ( 79544 , 79645 , 80075 , 81078 ), antithrombosis ( 78888 , 79701 ), lipid level lowering ( 80325 , 80640 ), and endothelial function improvement ( 80371 , 80662 ).. Meta-analyses show that curcumin increases flow-mediated dilation, but not other measures of endothelial function ( 102348 , 114903 ). Clinical studies show that turmeric or curcumin reduce some measures of arterial stiffness, including pulse wave velocity ( 101340 , 114900 , 114903 ). In atherosclerotic animal models, curcumin reduced atherosclerotic lesions ( 79150 , 80325 ), improved left ventricular function ( 79382 , 80802 , 80924 ), and reversed cardiac hypertrophy ( 80724 ). Inhibition of migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), and promotion of cell differentiation, have also been reported in animal and in vitro research ( 79073 , 79325 , 79426 , 79729 , 81419 ). There is also interest in using turmeric to reduce cardiovascular risk. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, migraine, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or kidney failure shows that nanocurcumin supplementation improves levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol among those with elevated baseline levels and obesity. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is also improved, regardless of baseline levels or trial duration, particularly in those with metabolic syndrome or obesity and those who are overweight. Systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic blood pressure, is also improved, particularly in those with elevated baseline systolic blood pressure, with trial duration less than 12 weeks, and in those with metabolic syndrome ( 106793 ). Fertility effects Evidence from in vitro and animal research suggests that curcumin can decrease sperm motility and density; cause degenerative changes in the seminiferous tubules; reduce luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated production of testosterone in adult Leydig cells; and reduce fertility when administered orally ( 79335 , 79404 , 80650 , 80944 , 81069 ). These effects are attributed to the inhibition of Leydig cell function or the hypothalamus-pituitary axis ( 79404 ). However, some evidence suggests that curcumin has positive effects on fertility. Laboratory research suggests that curcumin protects against the death of follicular cells and improves oocyte maturation in immune ovarian failure ( 81031 ). It also protects against ischemia-reperfusion induced injury of the testicles ( 80259 ). Gastrointestinal effects In both human and animal research, turmeric or its constituents increased bowel motility ( 80494 , 81075 ). In animal research, curcumin improved activity of digestive enzymes ( 49538 ). In animal research, turmeric and its constituent curcumin reduced the incidence of gastrointestinal ulcers and increased intestinal wall mucus and nonprotein sulfhydryl content ( 80042 , 80560 , 81187 ). Evidence from animal models also suggests that turmeric and its constituent curcumin reduce injury related to inflammatory colitis ( 79199 , 79247 , 79267 , 79891 ). Hematologic effects Clinical research in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis shows that administering a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg twice daily for 10 days decreases white blood cell, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts, all of which were elevated at baseline, when compared with placebo. Curcumin also reduced platelet counts when compared with placebo, although these levels remained in the normal range throughout the study ( 108873 ). Hepatoprotective effects Turmeric is traditionally used for liver health and for the treatment of jaundice and hepatitis. In animal models, turmeric constituents have been shown to attenuate induced liver damage and fibrosis ( 78957 , 79322 , 79439 , 80416 , 80699 , 80705 , 80831 , 80846 , 80857 , 80923 ). Potential mechanisms of action include beneficial effects on levels and activity of inflammatory cytokines or matrix metalloproteases ( 79551 , 79915 , 80055 , 80216 , 80416 , 80699 , 80831 , 80846 , 80942 ). While most animal research shows that turmeric is hepatoprotective, some toxicity studies in animals suggests that turmeric extracts can increase liver enzymes and liver weight, especially when given in high doses for longer durations. Rarely, turmeric has been linked to cases of acute non-infectious cholestatic hepatitis, and most often these cases are related to the use of highly bioavailable formulations at high doses ( 103633 ). There is also evidence that the risk for hepatotoxicity with turmeric may be increased in individuals with the HLAB*35:01 allele ( 109288 ). However, the mechanism of turmeric-induced hepatotoxicity is unclear. Hypolipidemic effects Clinical research suggests turmeric reduces levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides ( 78995 , 89725 , 114900 ). Curcumin and other constituents of turmeric also decrease levels of oxidized LDL ( 81268 , 81306 ). Animal research suggests that turmeric may lower cholesterol by stimulating the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids by increasing the activity of hepatic cholesterol-7 alpha hydroxylase ( 80225 , 81086 , 81338 , 81445 ). Other animal research suggests that turmeric decreases levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), which limits the formation of cholesterol in the body ( 81086 ). In vitro evidence suggests that the turmeric constituent curcumin upregulates the expression of LDL receptors on the surface of mouse macrophage and human hepatoma cells, which increases cholesterol uptake by these cells ( 79782 , 79873 , 80415 ). Immunomodulatory effects Preliminary research suggests that turmeric and curcumin might have immunostimulatory effects ( 11140 , 11147 ). Iron chelating effects Human research in adults with beta-thalassemia intermedia shows that taking curcumin 500 mg three times daily for 3 months in addition to the iron chelator deferasirox and standard treatment downregulates mRNA expression of growth differentiating factor 15 (GDF-15), which may in turn reduce suppression of hepcidin levels. Elevated hepcidin promotes internalization and degradation of the transmembrane iron exporter ferroportin, thereby inhibiting the release of iron from enterocytes, hepatocytes, and macrophages into the plasma, resulting in iron-chelating effects ( 113606 ). Musculoskeletal effects A small clinical study in healthy young adult females with moderate physical activity levels shows that taking curcumin 500 mg daily for 8 weeks decreases muscle damage, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase, and improves maximum oxygen update (VO2 max) when compared with placebo ( 106804 ). Radioprotective effects Preliminary clinical and animal research suggests that turmeric or its constituent curcumin can decrease radiation-induced mucositis ( 79436 , 89726 ). Potential mechanisms of action may involve a reduction in chromosomal aberrations, chromosomal fragments, and DNA strand breaks ( 78880 , 79140 , 79435 , 80376 , 81265 , 81435 ). The protective effects may also be related to the antioxidant effects of turmeric ( 78877 , 80955 ). Renal protective effects In animal models, turmeric or curcumin prevented renal injury and reduced inflammation induced by ischemia/reperfusion or by agents such acetaminophen or cyclosporine ( 79663 , 79725 , 79798 , 80579 , 80622 , 80624 , 80857 , 80948 , 81413 ). Also, curcumin has been shown to inhibit the accumulation of collagen IV and fibronectin in the glomeruli of animals with nephritis ( 79488 ). Respiratory effects Turmeric is commonly used for bronchitis and respiratory infections. Although there is inadequate human research investigating curcumin for this purpose, laboratory research has been conducted in both animals and in vitro models. Curcumin has been found to prevent fibrosis following induced lung injury ( 78982 , 79295 , 79889 , 80118 , 80912 ). Curcumin also appears to inhibit lung inflammation ( 80806 , 80909 ), airway hyperreactivity ( 79284 , 80956 ), and pulmonary emphysema ( 80548 ). Potential mechanisms of action included the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines ( 78982 , 79133 , 79295 , 79555 , 80045 , 80212 ), reduced neutrophil levels ( 80548 ), antioxidant effects ( 78982 , 79295 , 79539 , 79552 , 79555 , 80203 , 80909 , 80956 ), effects on NF-kappa B cell signaling ( 79555 ), protection of the anti-inflammatory protein histone deacetylase-2 ( 80322 ), and decreased nitric oxide synthase activity ( 78982 , 80417 , 80956 ). Skin effects In human research, taking curcumin was found to reduce pruritus severity ( 81120 , 81176 , 89724 ). Also, topical curcumin was of benefit in patients with skin lesions due to cancer ( 11148 ). Topical curcumin is commonly used for various skin conditions. Potential benefits of turmeric have been shown in animal models of skin damage, such as chronic ultraviolet B (UVB)-irradiated skin damage ( 80716 ). Benefits have included prevention of skin thickness increase and prevention of reduction in skin elasticity and the formation of wrinkles ( 80716 ). The inhibition of NF-kappaB may play a role in curcumin-induced beneficial effects in keratinocytes ( 79154 ). Would healing may also be improved. In animal research, topical curcumin increased cellular proliferation and collagen synthesis and crosslinking at the wound site, resulting in faster healing and increased tensile strength ( 79884 ). In the wound bed, curcumin resulted in alterations of TGF-beta and increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( 79213 ). Weight loss effects Curcumin may have a beneficial effect in obesity through downregulation of Janus kinase, which is thought to have a role in the pathogenesis of obesity, and inhibition of an enzyme that activates cortisol in adipocytes, playing a role in central obesity. Curcumin may also inhibit adipocyte differentiation through suppression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), and enhance monophosphate activated protein kinase and lipolysis ( 102345 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Likely Safe</data><data key="overview_text">Turmeric is a spice commonly used in Asian food that is derived from the root of the turmeric plant. The plant is a perennial herb and a member of the Zingiberaceae (ginger) family, and is cultivated in India and Southeast Asia. It is used in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine, and in Indian religious ceremonies (11140). Curcumin is the yellow-colored primary active constituent derived from turmeric. This turmeric constituent is commonly used to color foods and cosmetics.</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Allergic rhinitis (hay fever). Oral turmeric seems to improve symptoms in people with allergic rhinitis. A large clinical study in people with allergic rhinitis shows that taking a specific curcumin product (Organika Health Products) 500 mg daily for 2 months reduces nasal symptoms, including sneezing, itching, runny nose, and congestion, when compared with placebo ( 96138 ). more Depression. Most research shows that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, when used at doses of at least 1 gram daily for at least 6 weeks improves symptoms of depression when taken alone or in combination with antidepressant medications. Curcumin appears to be most beneficial for depression in middle aged patients compared to older patients, when taken for at least 6 weeks, and when used at a dose of at least 1 gram daily. In adults with major depressive disorder, a meta-analysis of data from 6 clinical studies, as well as individual studies not included in this analysis, show that taking curcumin 1 gram daily along with an antidepressant moderately improves depression symptoms when compared with placebo ( 96131 , 96139 ). Another meta-analysis of 10 studies shows symptom reductions in patients with major depression when combined with conventional antidepressants, but not when used alone in patients with milder depressive symptoms. However, the quality of the evidence is low ( 104971 ). Additionally, a large clinical study in adults with mild-moderate symptoms of depression shows that taking curcumin 750 mg twice daily for 12 months modestly reduces depression symptoms when compared with placebo ( 114898 ). When used alone, one clinical study shows that curcumin 1 gram daily for 6 weeks may be similarly effective to fluoxetine 20 mg daily. Taking both products together seems to be more effective than either product alone, increasing the response rate from 65% to 78% ( 89728 ). Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that curcumin extract at doses of 500-1000 mg daily is provisionally recommended for monotherapy or adjunctive use in mild to moderate depression ( 110318 ). more Dyspepsia. Oral turmeric may be modestly beneficial for some patients with dyspepsia. In patients with functional dyspepsia, small clinical studies show that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is similarly effective when compared with the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole. Clinical research shows that taking turmeric 500 mg four times daily for 7 days can relieve overall symptoms of dyspepsia in 64% more patients than taking placebo ( 11144 ). A small, unblinded clinical study in patients with a type of dyspepsia called postprandial distress syndrome shows that taking turmeric 250 mg or 500 mg orally three times daily after meals for 4 weeks is associated with reductions in symptom scores which are similar to those seen with simethicone 60 mg three times daily for 4 weeks. However, the recurrence rate upon stopping therapy was about 14% with simethicone, compared with 43% to 46% with turmeric ( 104963 ). In patients with functional dyspepsia, taking the constituent curcumin appears similarly effective when compared with omeprazole, but might not provide further symptom reduction in those also taking famotidine or omeprazole ( 106063 , 106801 , 111599 ). One small clinical study in Iran shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg daily in addition to famotidine 40 mg daily for 30 days is no more effective for reducing overall symptoms of dyspepsia, such as abdominal pain, heartburn, bloating, and nausea, when compared with famotidine alone ( 106063 ). Another small clinical study in Thailand shows that taking curcumin 500 mg four times daily for 4 weeks is similarly effective for reducing dyspepsia severity and improving satisfaction when compared with an unspecified dose of omeprazole and more effective when compared with placebo ( 106801 ). Similarly, a moderate-size clinical study in Thailand shows that taking curcumin 500 mg four times daily for 4 weeks is similarly effective for reducing dyspepsia severity when compared with omeprazole 20 mg daily. However, taking curcumin and omeprazole in combination did not provide further symptom reduction ( 111599 ). The validity of these results is limited by the high rate of study dropouts. more Hyperlipidemia. Research is conflicting on whether oral turmeric, curcumin, or curcuminoids can reduce serum lipids. Any improvement in lipids is likely to be small. Reasons for the conflicting findings may relate to turmeric formulation, duration of treatment, and/or the baseline cholesterol status of the included patients. Results from meta-analyses of clinical research show inconsistent and conflicting results. One large meta-analysis of over 50 clinical studies in healthy adults and those with a variety of conditions shows that supplementation with turmeric or curcumin 80-4000 mg daily for 4-24 weeks reduces total cholesterol by 4 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 5 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 7 mg/dL and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 2 mg/dL when compared with placebo ( 112119 ). Two other meta-analyses of 27 clinical studies agree that taking turmeric, curcumin, or curcuminoids moderately reduce triglyceride levels but suggest that turmeric does not improve total cholesterol when compared with placebo. However, the meta-analyses contradict one another on whether turmeric and its constituents reduce LDL cholesterol or increase HDL cholesterol. ( 96128 , 96135 ). Additionally, a third meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials shows that taking up to 2400 mg daily of curcumin or curcuminoids, from turmeric or isolated sources, for up to 12 weeks, does not significantly improve triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or total cholesterol ( 110220 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, seems to attenuate fat deposition and improve some metabolic parameters in adults with NAFLD. Clinical research shows that taking curcumin daily reduces NAFLD severity in 30% to 79% of patients, compared to 5% to 27.5% of patients receiving placebo. Curcumin also reduces the quantity of additional fat deposition in the liver to 0% to 4.5%, compared to 17.5% to 26% in those taking placebo. Most research shows that taking curcumin also reduces liver enzyme levels, body mass index (BMI), blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and total cholesterol when compared with placebo. Although some clinical research shows that taking curcumin improves levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that these lipid levels are not improved in patients with NAFLD, specifically ( 97430 , 97431 , 100258 , 102350 , 106062 , 107120 , 109279 , 111349 , 114901 ). However, another meta-analysis of 14 small, heterogeneous clinical studies in adults with NAFLD, that included some of these studies, shows that taking various doses and forms of turmeric or curcumin modestly reduces liver enzyme levels, improves measures of insulin resistance, reduces waist circumference, and improves LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels when compared with placebo ( 111348 ). A small clinical trial in patients with NAFLD given specific lifestyle recommendations shows that taking curcumin modestly reduces the frequency of metabolic syndrome and fatty liver but does not have beneficial effects on fatty liver-associated indices, adiposity, or the atherogenic index, when compared with placebo ( 109285 ). Findings for specific endpoints are mixed between individual studies and may depend on the dose and formulation of curcumin used or the duration of treatment. These studies have used various doses and formulations. In one study, 500 mg of a dispersion formulation equivalent to 70 mg of curcumin daily for 8 weeks was used ( 97430 ). Also, 250 mg once daily or 500 mg twice daily of a specific phytosomal formulation (Meriva, Indena) containing curcumin and soy phosphatidylcholine in a 1:2 ratio and standardized to an overall curcuminoid content of 20% was taken for 8 weeks ( 97431 , 106062 ). Another study used 1 gram of powdered turmeric rhizome taken three times daily with meals for 12 weeks ( 102350 ). One study used a curcumin-piperine complex (Curcumin C3 complex 500 mg plus Bioperine 5 mg) daily for 8 weeks ( 107120 ). One study used curcumin (Arjuna Natural Extract) 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks ( 109285 ). Despite positive results with curcumin in several small clinical studies of patients with NAFLD, there is some concern that curcumin might cause hepatotoxicity in rare cases, especially when highly bioavailable formulations are used in high doses ( 103633 ). There is also evidence that the risk for hepatotoxicity with curcumin may be increased in individuals with the HLAB*35:01 allele ( 109288 ). Curcumin-induced hepatotoxicity has not been reported in clinical trials of patients with NAFLD, and its potential mechanism is unclear. However, patients seeking to take curcumin for NAFLD should be advised to monitor for symptoms of hepatotoxicity, including abdominal pain, dark urine, fatigue, jaundice, nausea, and pruritus. more Oral mucositis. Oral curcumin or curcumin-containing mouthwash seem to reduce the development of severe oral mucositis, as well as reduce the severity and pain of oral mucositis, associated with cancer treatment. Clinical research in patients receiving radiotherapy following recent radical surgery for oral cancer shows that taking turmeric (BCM-95, Arjuna Natural Pvt. Ltd., India) during radiotherapy reduces the incidence of severe oral mucositis to 25% or 20% in those taking turmeric 500 mg two or three times daily, respectively, compared with 65% in those taking placebo. The incidences of severe oral pain, dysphagia, and dermatitis were also reduced by at least 50% ( 105398 ). A small clinical study in patients receiving chemotherapy with or without head and neck radiotherapy shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg twice daily for 7 weeks improves severity of oral mucositis at weeks 1, 4, and 7 and reduces pain at week 7 when compared with placebo. Effects were more pronounced in those with chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis than radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis ( 106800 ). In patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy, preliminary clinical research shows that swishing with 10 mL of turmeric solution (prepared by dissolving turmeric 400 mg in 80 mL of water) six times daily for 6 weeks delays mucositis and reduces the number of cases of intolerable mucositis by 49% when compared to swishing with 10 mL of povidone-iodine solution twice daily for 6 weeks ( 89726 ). Another small clinical study shows that swishing with 10 mL of nanoparticulate curcumin 0.1% mouthwash three times daily for 6 weeks is associated with a 50% lower risk of developing oral mucositis, and a delay of 2 weeks in the onset of mucositis, when compared with benzydamine 0.15% mouthwash ( 104969 ). A small clinical study in patients with mucositis due to head and neck radiotherapy shows that taking curcumin nanoparticles (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 40 mg daily or using 10 mL of a curcumin 0.1% mouthwash three times daily for up to 21 days improves scores related to pain, burning, ulceration, and erythema when compared with placebo. Results with either oral or topical curcumin were similar ( 111350 ). more Osteoarthritis. Some oral turmeric extracts and combination products containing turmeric seem to improve certain symptoms of knee osteoarthritis. However, it is unclear how turmeric compares to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Several meta-analyses of clinical studies show that turmeric extracts and/or curcuminoid products reduce knee pain and stiffness, improve physical function, and reduce the need for rescue medication when compared with placebo ( 104970 , 106792 , 109280 , 110222 ). However, a reduced effect was noted in patients with increasing age or body mass index ( 104790 ). The studies evaluated in these meta-analyses are heterogeneous, of low- to moderate-quality, and utilized a variety of products and/or dosing strategies ( 104970 , 106792 , 109280 , 110222 ). Small to moderate-sized clinical studies show that specific products (Meriva, Indena; Theracurmin, Theravalues Corp) containing curcumin 90-100 mg twice daily for up to 6 months, or specific turmeric extracts (Turmacin, Natural Remedies Pvt. Ltd.; Curcugen, DolCas Biotech, LLC) 500 mg twice daily for 6-12 weeks, reduce pain and analgesic use and improve functionality when compared with placebo ( 17953 , 80988 , 89721 , 97424 , 104148 , 107118 ). A specific turmeric extract (CuraMed, EuroPharma USA) 1500 mg daily for 12 weeks improves functionality, but not pain, when compared with placebo ( 96127 ). Also, a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina), 40 mg twice daily for 6 weeks, improves pain, stiffness, and physical activity scores and reduces intake of rescue acetaminophen by about 60% when compared with placebo ( 102349 ). However, not all turmeric products seem to be effective for improving symptoms of osteoarthritis. One small clinical study shows that taking a specific turmeric extract (B-Turmactive, PLAMECA S.A.) 500 mg daily for one week does not reduce knee pain when compared with placebo ( 104147 ). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that benefits are limited to bio-optimized forms of curcuminoids, and benefits related to pure extracts are lacking ( 110222 ). Turmeric has also been compared with conventional treatments for knee osteoarthritis in small meta-analyses, a network meta-analysis, and individual clinical studies. However, the evidence is mixed as to whether turmeric is as effective or more effective than NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen 400 mg taken 2-3 times daily, diclofenac 25-100 mg daily, or chondroprotective drugs ( 17952 , 89720 , 89722 , 106792 , 109280 , 110222 , 113607 ). A network meta-analysis comparing 6 interventions in adults with knee osteoarthritis suggests that curcumin monotherapy, curcumin with chondroprotective agents, or curcumin with NSAIDs improves scores related to pain, function, and stiffness while reducing the need for rescue medication and the incidence of adverse events ( 113607 ). Individual studies are heterogenous with respect to comparator medication and dosing schedule. Doses included a non-commercial turmeric extract 500 mg 3-4 times daily for 4-6 weeks ( 17952 , 89720 ) or turmeric extract 500 mg twice daily for 3 months ( 89722 ). Topical turmeric has also been evaluated. One clinical study shows that applying curcumin topically as a 5% ointment in Vaseline twice daily for 6 weeks reduces pain associated with knee osteoarthritis by a mean of about 11 on a 100-point visual analog scale when compared with placebo ( 104964 ). Another clinical study in patients with knee osteoarthritis shows that applying curcumin in a self-nano-emulsifying polyethylene glycol organogel 1.5 grams to the knee twice daily for 8 weeks reduces pain, stiffness, and difficulty with physical function scores by 72%, 62%, and 46%, respectively, when compared to baseline, with improvements superior to placebo for all outcomes ( 113357 ). Research also shows that taking specific combination products containing turmeric and other ingredients can improve pain and functionality in patients with osteoarthritis. These combination products have combined turmeric with chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride (CartiJoint Forte, Fidia Farmaceutici SpA); boswellic acid (Curamin, EuroPharma USA; Rhulief); Boswellia serrata (Rhulief); ashwagandha, Boswellia serrata, and zinc (Articulin-F, Eisen Pharmaceutical Co. Pvt. Ltd.); devil's claw and bromelain (AINAT, Laboratoire de Rhumatologie Appliquée); Boswellia serrata, guggul, and valerian (Phytoproflex, OPTM Healthcare); Boswellia serrata and terminalia (LI73014F2, Laila Nutraceuticals); ashwagandha, Boswellia serrata, and ginger (Artrex, Mendar); or extracts of ginger rhizome, devil's claw tuber, Boswellia serrata resin, and celery seed (Tregocel, Max Biocare) ( 19276 , 51950 , 81466 , 89717 , 89719 , 96127 , 97419 , 97421 , 97428 , 106078 )( 109280 ). more Pruritus. Oral turmeric has been evaluated for the management of pruritus of various etiologies, with promising results. Clinical research in patients with kidney failure shows that taking turmeric 500 mg orally three times daily for 8 weeks decreases symptoms of uremic pruritus by 1.9-fold when compared with placebo ( 89724 ). Also, a small clinical study in patients with sulfur mustard-induced chronic pruritus shows that taking a specific combination product (C3 Complex, Sami Labs LTD) containing curcumin 1 gram plus extract from black pepper or long pepper (Bioperine) daily for 4 weeks reduces pruritus severity and improves quality of life when compared with placebo ( 81120 , 81176 ). more Possibly Ineffective Alzheimer disease. Neither oral turmeric nor its constituent curcumin appears to improve cognitive function or attenuate cognitive decline in adults with this condition. A small clinical trial shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, 1-4 grams daily for 6 months does not improve mental state examination scores when compared with placebo ( 17096 ). Furthermore, a meta-analysis of this study and another small clinical study in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that the turmeric group experienced greater cognitive decline when compared with placebo ( 100261 ). While this research is limited by small study sizes and heterogeneous patient populations, the current evidence does not support the use of turmeric in patients with this condition. more Peptic ulcers. Oral turmeric does not seem to improve the healing of peptic or gastric ulcers when compared with placebo or liquid antacids. Some clinical research shows that taking turmeric 2 grams three times daily for 8 weeks does not improve the healing of peptic ulcers when compared with placebo in Vietnamese patients ( 81444 ). Also, taking powdered turmeric rhizome 250 mg four times daily for 6 weeks seems to be less effective than a liquid aluminum-magnesium-hydroxide antacid for promoting gastric ulcer healing ( 81284 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acne. Although there has been interest in using topical turmeric for acne, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose. Age-related cognitive decline. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may modestly improve cognition in elderly patients experiencing cognitive decline. A meta-analysis of three small clinical trials shows that curcumin modestly improves cognition in the elderly ( 100261 ). One of these clinical trials shows that taking a specific brand of curcumin (Theracurmin, Theravalues Corp.) 90 mg twice daily for 18 months improves long-term memory and attention when compared with placebo in middle-aged and older adults with or without mild cognitive impairment ( 96161 ). more Amenorrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral turmeric for amenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose. Ankylosing spondylitis. Although there has been interest in using oral turmeric for ankylosing spondylitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose. Anxiety. Some clinical research show that oral curcumin reduces symptoms of anxiety. A meta-analysis of 8 mostly low-quality clinical studies in adults with anxiety symptoms or an anxiety disorder diagnosis shows that taking curcumin 500-1000 mg daily for up to 12 weeks modestly reduces symptoms of anxiety when compared with placebo ( 114902 ). The validity of the meta-analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, including differences in the patient populations, form and doses curcumin, treatment durations, and types of anxiety scales used. Additionally, all studies were conducted in either Iran or Australia which may limit generalizability of results to other populations. more Aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. A small clinical trial in patients experiencing aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia shows that taking curcuminoids as a nanoemulsion (Curcumin C3 Complex, Sabinsa Corporation) 200 mg daily for 3 months does not improve grip strength or joint symptoms when compared with placebo ( 113345 ). However, this study may have been underpowered to detect a difference between groups. more Asthma. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral turmeric, as an adjunct to conventional asthma treatment, does not improve lung function or symptoms in adults and children with asthma. One small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate asthma shows that adjuvant therapy with turmeric as curcumin 500 mg twice daily for 30 days does not improve lung function based on FEV1, or improve symptoms such as dyspnea, wheezing, cough, or tightness, when compared to standard treatment alone ( 99349 ). A small clinical trial in children 7-18 years of age with moderate to severe asthma shows that adding turmeric 500-1000 mg (containing 20-40 mg curcuminoids) daily for 6 months to standard therapy does not improve overall asthma symptoms when compared with placebo and standard therapy, although it may decrease the frequency of nighttime awakenings and the use of rescue inhalers ( 99348 ). Due to their small sizes and high drop-out rates, these studies may have been underpowered to detect a difference between groups. more Athletic performance. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for athletic performance. Preliminary clinical research in middle-aged male long-distance runners shows that taking a turmeric extract providing 2 grams of curcumin 95% and piperine 5% daily for 6 weeks does not improve aerobic capacity when compared with placebo ( 109286 ). more Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial in BPH. A clinical study in patients with BPH shows that taking curcumin 2250 mg once daily along with tamsulosin and finasteride for 6 months improves lower urinary tract symptoms related to storage, but not overall symptoms or symptoms related to voiding, by about 35%, compared with 25% in those receiving tamsulosin and finasteride alone. Periprostatic fat thickness, quality of life, and erectile function also were improved ( 106799 ). more Beta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for iron overload in patients with beta-thalassemia. A small clinical study in patients with beta-thalassemia major and iron overload shows that taking turmeric extract containing curcumin 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) by 0.6 micromol/L, but not hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, total iron binding capacity, ferritin, or hepcidin, when compared with placebo ( 99306 ). Another small clinical study in adult males with beta-thalassemia intermedia and iron overload shows that taking a higher dose of curcumin 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces serum iron and ferritin turmeric levels and transferrin saturation when compared with placebo ( 108871 ). more Bruises. Although there has been interest in using topical turmeric to alleviate bruising, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose. Cachexia. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for cancer cachexia. A small clinical trial in patients with cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome shows that taking curcumin 800 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not reduce weight loss or improve body composition or handgrip strength when compared with placebo ( 109283 ). more Canker sores. Some preliminary research suggests that topical curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for minor canker sores. Preliminary clinical research in young adults with minor canker sores shows that applying a 2% curcumin oral gel for 6 months reduces ulcer size, pain, and recurrence rate and increases healing rate similarly to 0.1% triamcinolone oral paste ( 104962 ). The validity of the study is limited by a lack of investigator blinding and the lack of an intention to treat analysis. Another small clinical study shows that applying a 1% curcumin nanomicelle gel (SinaCurcumin Pharmaceuticals) on lesions three times daily for one week is modestly more effective than applying a 2% curcumin gel for reducing pain and ulcer size ( 109282 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a non-curcumin comparator group. more Carpal tunnel syndrome. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. It is unclear if topical curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for carpal tunnel syndrome. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking a combination product containing turmeric, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, phosphatidylserine, and vitamins C, E, B1, B2, B6, and B12 twice daily for 60 days reduces symptom severity and pain but does not improve measures of hand and wrist function when compared with control ( 111702 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding. The study may also be inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Additionally, it is unclear if the effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination. Topical turmeric has also been investigated. A small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that applying a 1% curcuminoid gel (Sinanomin) to the wrists twice daily for 8 weeks modestly decreases symptom severity and improves function when compared with a placebo gel. However, there was no change in electrodiagnostic testing of the injury. All patients also used a night splint ( 113356 ). more Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema. It is unclear if oral or topical turmeric reduces the risk for acral erythema from capecitabine. A small clinical trial in adults with cancer shows that taking turmeric 4 grams daily for 6 weeks starting at the beginning of treatment with capecitabine does not reduce the incidence of acral erythema overall; however, it does seem to reduce acral erythema grade 2 or higher when compared with expected incidence rates ( 99309 ). Topical turmeric has also been evaluated. A clinical study in patients with colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, or breast cancer receiving capecitabine shows that applying a specific ointment (Alpha) standardized to contain curcumin extract 0.5% and henna extract 10% to the soles and palms twice daily, beginning on day 1 of chemotherapy and continued for 4 cycles, does not prevent acral erythema or improve World Health Organization severity scores when compared with placebo. A post-hoc analysis suggests that there may have been a trend toward delayed onset and progression; however, this study was not structured to assess these outcomes ( 108874 ). more Chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral curcumin reduces symptoms of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. A small clinical study in patients with various forms of cancer receiving standard chemotherapy for that cancer type shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg twice daily for 9 weeks does not reduce symptoms of diarrhea when compared with placebo ( 107111 ). more Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is unclear if oral curcumin reduces CINV. A small clinical study in patients with various forms of cancer receiving standard chemotherapy for that cancer type shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg twice daily for 9 weeks modestly reduces symptoms of nausea, but not vomiting, in the second and third months after the start of treatment when compared with placebo ( 107111 ). more Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. It is unclear if oral curcumin reduces symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. A small clinical study in patients with various forms of cancer receiving standard chemotherapy for that cancer type shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg twice daily for 9 weeks modestly reduces symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy over a three-month period when compared with placebo ( 107111 ). more Chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for CKD. A meta-analysis of four small clinical trials in patients with CKD related to diabetic nephropathy or lupus nephritis shows that taking curcumin or turmeric for 0.5-4 months moderately reduces proteinuria when compared with placebo ( 109276 ). Also, a small clinical trial in children and young adults ages 6-25 years with vascular dysfunction related to autosomal dominant polycystic disease (PKD) shows that curcumin powder 25 mg/kg daily for 12 months does not improve vascular function or kidney function when compared with placebo ( 107117 ). more Colorectal adenoma. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for managing colorectal adenoma. Preliminary clinical research in adults with familial adenomatous polyposis shows that taking curcumin 1500 mg twice daily for 12 months does not reduce the quantity or size of lower intestinal adenomatous polyps when compared with placebo ( 97427 ). A very small clinical trial in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis shows that taking 8 capsules daily of a turmeric extract, in a formulation also containing pepper fruit, spirulina, seaweed, and ginger root, for 6 months does not affect total polyp number or burden when compared with placebo. However, both number and burden were modestly reduced in the left colon. Each capsule provided curcuminoids 123.65 mg and turmerones 26.79 mg ( 110223 ). more Colorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer. A small clinical trial in patients undergoing chemotherapy following colorectal cancer surgery shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly improves some measures of quality of life when compared with placebo ( 107109 ). In addition, a small clinical study in people at high risk for colorectal cancer, such as those who smoke, shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, 4 grams daily for 30 days can reduce the number of precancerous rectal aberrant crypt foci ( 18204 ). It is not clear if this results in a reduced risk for colorectal cancer. more Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. One small study suggests that oral turmeric may reduce the risk for myocardial infarction after CABG surgery. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcuminoids, 4 grams daily in four divided doses, beginning 3 days prior to surgery and continuing for 5 days post-surgery, decreases the relative risk of myocardial infarction following CABG by approximately 56% when compared with placebo ( 81143 ). more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral turmeric or its constituent, curcumin, is beneficial for reducing symptoms of COVID-19. Small studies have evaluated curcumin as an adjunctive therapy in adults hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. Patients in these studies also received treatments such as antimicrobials, anti-inflammatory medications, anticoagulants, antiretrovirals, and immunosuppressants ( 104966 , 105393 , 107119 ). One study shows that adding curcumin reduces the duration of shortness of breath by 6-9 days when compared with patients who received other treatments in combination with probiotics. However, there were no differences in the duration of other symptoms, including fever, cough, or sore throat. Subgroup analyses suggest that taking curcumin may improve oxygenation and reduce the need for supplemental oxygen or ventilation ( 105393 ). Another study shows that adding curcumin modestly reduces the time to resolution of COVID-19 symptoms, the length of supplemental oxygen use, and the likelihood for deterioration in the patients' condition when compared with patients who received other treatments alone ( 104966 ). A third study shows some benefit of curcumin on fever and cough when compared with baseline; however, it is unclear if any changes were significant when compared with placebo ( 107119 ). Doses of curcumin used in these studies include curcumin 525 mg with piperine 2.5 mg (C3 Complex, SamiDirect) twice daily, starting at admission and continuing for 14 days ( 105393 ), or a specific nanocurcumin product (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg twice daily for 2 weeks or 240 mg daily in divided doses for 7 days ( 104966 , 107119 ). Limitations of these studies include the small number of patients with severe symptoms, the large number of outcomes evaluated, the inconsistencies in other treatments used, the lack of clarity related to presentation of some results, and, in most cases, a lack of blinding. Turmeric has also been evaluated in adults in the outpatient setting with suspected or confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19. One small clinical study shows that taking curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg twice daily for 14 days in addition to other COVID-19 treatments (mainly hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin) reduces the duration of cough, chills, myalgia, and smell and taste disturbance, but not dyspnea, fever, sore throat, or others, by 1-2 days when compared with placebo with other treatments ( 106802 ). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of confirmatory diagnosis at baseline and lack of consistency with other treatments, as well as the unclear reporting of symptom duration in relation to the initiation of treatment. Another small clinical study in outpatients confirmed to have COVID-19 shows that taking curcumin 1000 mg plus piperine 10 mg (Sami Labs Limited) daily for 14 days modestly improves weakness, but not cough, pain, headache, difficulty breathing, or biochemical indices, when compared with placebo ( 109278 ). However, a clinical study in adults with confirmed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 shows that taking curcumin (curcuRouge®, TheraBioPharma) 360 mg twice daily for 7 days within 5 days of COVID-19 diagnosis does not reduce the risk of fever or oxygen saturation below 96% when compared with placebo ( 114905 ). Some research has also examined the effect of turmeric as part of a polyherbal combination. Clinical research in patients hospitalized for moderate COVID-19 symptoms shows that using an Ayurvedic formulation 1776 mg twice daily containing turmeric, ashwagandha, ginger, and Boswellia serrata (BV-4051) for 14 days modestly reduces the duration of illness and reduces the severity of fever, cough, and smell and taste dysfunction when compared to placebo. There was no beneficial effect on other symptoms, including nasal congestion, breathing difficulty, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. More than half of the patients were also treated with remdesivir which did not impact the majority of these findings ( 109899 ). more Crohn disease. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for improving symptoms of active Crohn disease. Some clinical research shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, 1.08 grams daily for one month, then 1.44 grams daily for one month, can reduce bowel movements, diarrhea, and abdominal pain when compared to baseline in patients with Crohn disease ( 79730 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Denture stomatitis. Topical turmeric may be beneficial for treating denture stomatitis. A small clinical study in patients with denture stomatitis shows that applying topical curcumin gel (Curenext, Abbott Laboratories) three times daily for 2 weeks resolves denture stomatitis lesions similarly to clotrimazole ointment ( 106797 ). more Diabetes. Lower quality clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may modestly improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes. A meta-analysis of small clinical trials in patients with diabetic kidney disease shows that curcumin reduces levels of fasting glucose by approximately 8.3 mg/dL when compared with placebo. Curcumin was used in doses of 66.3-1670 mg daily for 2-6 months ( 107114 ). Preliminary clinical research included in the analysis shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by about 20 mg/dL ( 104149 ). Other meta-analyses of low- to moderate-quality clinical studies in patients with a variety of conditions including type 2 diabetes show that taking turmeric extract, curcumin, or curcuminoids for 4-36 weeks improves glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.4-0.7% and reduces fasting glucose by approximately 13 mg/dL when compared with placebo or conventional treatment ( 106806 , 108877 , 113604 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies and broad curcuminoid doses ranging from 46-1500 mg daily. Conversely, other meta-analyses in patients with type 2 diabetes show that curcumin does not reduce HbA1c or insulin levels when compared with placebo ( 104965 , 108877 , 113604 ). more Diabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Preliminary clinical research in patients with grade 3 diabetic foot ulcers shows that taking nanocurcumin 80 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or change the rate of ulcer healing when compared with placebo. Taking turmeric did result in modest decreases in fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and insulin resistance ( 104972 ). more Diabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Meta-analyses of two to four small clinical trials in patients with diabetic kidney disease show that curcumin modestly improves serum levels of creatinine, total cholesterol, and fasting glucose, and reduces systolic blood pressure by 4 mmHg, when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on diastolic blood pressure, proteinuria, or serum levels of other plasma lipids or blood urea nitrogen. Curcumin was used in doses of 66.3-1670 mg daily for 2-6 months ( 107114 ). One small study included in this analysis, which evaluated patients receiving hemodialysis, shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by about 20 mg/dL when compared with placebo ( 104149 ). more Dry eye. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A clinical study in adults with dry eye disease shows that taking a combination supplement containing curcumin extract that provides 200 mg curcuminoids plus lutein, vitamin D3, and zeaxanthin daily for 8 weeks improves tear production and overall patient-reported symptoms (e.g., burning or sore eyes, blurred vision, difficulty reading) when compared with placebo ( 116214 ). However, the clinical significance is unclear, and the use of artificial tears did not differ between groups. It is unclear if these benefits are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination. more Dysmenorrhea. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A clinical study in university students aged 18 to 24 in Iran with mild to severe primary dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) shows that taking a specific combination product containing curcumin 500 mg plus extract from black pepper 5 mg (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) daily, starting 7 days prior to menstruation and continuing for 3 days after menstruation for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles, does not improve the severity of symptoms when compared with placebo ( 106805 ). Conversely, a small clinical study in adults with moderately painful dysmenorrhea shows that taking a single dose of a combination product containing turmeric, Boswellia serrata, and sesame (Rhuleave-K, Arjuna Natural Private Ltd.) 1000 mg at the start of menstruation relieves menstrual cramp pain and reduces pain intensity for up to 6 hours when compared with placebo ( 112806 ). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combinations. more Endometriosis. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for reducing pain due to endometriosis. A small clinical study in adults with endometriosis shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not affect pain associated with endometriosis or quality of life when compared with placebo ( 113603 ). more Erythema. Although there has been interest in using topical turmeric for reducing erythema, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose. Exercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for reducing muscle damage from exercise. A meta-analysis of 12 small, lower-quality clinical studies in adults shows that taking curcumin 150-500 mg as a single dose before or after exercise or 180-5000 mg daily for up to 56 days reduces markers of muscle damage (i.e. serum creatine kinase levels) when compared with placebo. Curcumin seems most beneficial for this effect in untrained adults and when administered as a single dose. Additionally, a meta-analysis of 3 of these clinical studies shows that curcumin improves range of motion ( 114897 ). The interpretation of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity. more Exercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral turmeric or its constituent, curcumin, is beneficial for reducing muscle soreness from exercise. A meta-analysis of 12 small, lower-quality clinical studies in trained and untrained adults shows that taking curcumin 150-500 mg as a single dose before or after exercise or 180-5000 mg daily for up to 56 days time reduces muscle soreness when compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis indicated that the largest effect size is observed at 96 hours post-exercise with progressively smaller effect sizes at earlier time points ( 114897 ). The interpretation of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity. Turmeric has also been examined in combination with other ingredients. Clinical research in healthy active adults with moderate to severe exercise-induced muscle pain shows that taking a single, 1000-mg dose of turmeric and Boswellia serrata extracts in black sesame oil (Rhuleave-K; Arjuna Natural Private Ltd.) improves pain relief when compared with placebo, with maximal benefits within about 3 hours. The number of people needed to treat to obtain pain relief of at least 50% over a 6-hour period was 1.1 ( 109277 ). more Gingivitis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral turmeric and turmeric mouthwash may reduce the severity of gingivitis. Turmeric mouthwash appears to be similarly effective to chlorhexidine mouthwash. A meta-analysis of generally preliminary clinical research shows that rinsing with a mouthwash containing curcumin for 3-4 weeks is as effective as rinsing with chlorhexidine for reducing the severity of gingivitis or plaque ( 106059 ). Mouthwashes in these studies contained 0.05% to 20% curcumin and were usually used twice daily for 3-4 weeks ( 81127 , 89723 , 106059 ). One mouthwash contained 0.05% turmeric extract and 0.005% eugenol ( 89723 ). Another small clinical trial shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg daily by mouth after breakfast for 4 weeks reduces the severity of gingivitis and gingival bleeding, but not plaque, when compared with placebo in patients with gingivitis and mild periodontitis ( 104146 ). more Gout. Although there is interest in using oral turmeric for gout, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this condition. Gulf war syndrome. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial in patients with Gulf war syndrome. A small preliminary clinical trial in patients with Gulf war syndrome shows that taking curcumin (Meriva, Indena, S.p.A.) 500 mg twice daily for 30 days reduces overall symptoms, including pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress, and others, by 19% when compared with baseline. Taking a higher dose of 2000 mg twice daily for an additional 30 days appears to be no more effective than the lower dose ( 105395 ). more Hearing loss. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for treating hearing loss. A small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate hearing impairment shows that taking curcumin 500 mg daily for 12 weeks improves some measures of auditory function, such as auditory brain stem response threshold, when compared with placebo ( 114906 ). more Helicobacter pylori. Small clinical studies suggest that oral turmeric is not beneficial for eradicating H. pylori when used alone or in combination with standard triple therapy or famotidine. One small clinical study in patients with H. pylori gastritis shows that taking turmeric 2.1 grams daily for 4 weeks is less effective for eradicating H. pylori than taking an omeprazole-based triple regimen for one week ( 80957 ). Another small study in adults with peptic ulcers shows that taking a specific curcumin product (C3 Complex, Sami Labs LTD) 500 mg daily for 7 days, in conjunction with standard triple therapy, does not improve H. pylori eradication rates when compared with standard triple therapy alone. The addition of curcumin increased the resolution of dyspepsia symptoms by an additional 21%, but the clinical significance of this outcome is unclear ( 97420 ). In patients with dyspepsia, most of whom tested positive for fecal H. pylori antigen, clinical research shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg daily in addition to famotidine 40 mg daily for 30 days is no more effective for reducing fecal H. pylori antigen levels than taking famotidine alone ( 106063 ). more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial in patients with hypertension. A meta-analysis of approximately 30 clinical studies in healthy adults or patients with a variety of conditions shows that taking turmeric, curcumin, curcuminoids, or nano-curcumin for 4 to 24 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure by about 2 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by about 0.8 mmHg when compared with placebo ( 113602 ). However, these blood pressure reductions may not be clinically meaningful. In addition, most of the included studies were small and utilized heterogeneous dosing regimens. more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Oral turmeric may modestly improve glucose control in some patients with prediabetes. In overweight or obese individuals with prediabetes, clinical research shows that taking a turmeric extract (BCM95 or Cucugreen; M/s Arjuna Natural Pvt Ltd.) 500 mg daily, providing 95% curcuminoids and at least 65% curcumin, for 90 days, either alone or in combination with zinc 30 mg as zinc gluconate, results in a small reduction in fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with placebo. There was also a small benefit in insulin sensitivity ( 105391 ). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with prediabetes shows that taking 500 mg of a combination of turmeric extract and Indian gooseberry extract in a 1:2 ratio along with phosphatidylcholine (EmbliQur) twice daily for 6 months modestly reduces fasting glucose and improves insulin resistance, when compared with placebo. However, changes in most other endpoints were not significantly different from placebo. Each 500 mg capsule contained turmeric extracts 29.86% and turmeric oil 1.27% ( 113355 ). The effect of turmeric on progression to type 2 diabetes in patients with prediabetes has also been investigated. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a turmeric extract containing curcumin 750 mg twice daily for 9 months reduces the percentage of patients with prediabetes who develop type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo ( 81163 ). more Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for improving symptoms of IBS. Preliminary clinical research in otherwise healthy adults with IBS shows that taking a turmeric extract (Cynara Turmeric, Lichtwer Pharma) 72-144 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces IBS symptoms by about 40% to 60% when compared to baseline ( 79565 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Taking a combination product (CU-FEO, Alfa Wasserman S.p.A.) containing curcumin 42 mg and fennel essential oil 25 mg per capsule twice daily for 60 days improves overall ratings of abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and quality of life by 24% when compared with placebo ( 97422 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, fennel, or the combination. Observational research suggests that adding a supplement (Enterofytol PLUS) providing curcumin 42 mg and berberine 200 mg twice daily for 2 months to conventional IBS treatment is associated with improvements in symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, distension, and stool status, by up to 48% when compared with conventional treatment alone. Use of the supplement was also associated with a 64% reduced need for conventional treatments ( 113354 ). more Joint pain. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research shows that taking capsules of a specific combination product (Instaflex Joint Support, Direct Digital) containing glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg, methylsulfonylmethane 500 mg, white willow bark extract 250 mg, ginger root concentrate 50 mg, Boswellia extract 125 mg, turmeric root extract 50 mg, cayenne 40 m H.U. 50 mg, and hyaluronic acid 4 mg in three divided doses daily for 8 weeks reduces joint pain severity by 37% compared to only 16% with placebo. However, it does not improve joint stiffness or function when compared with placebo ( 89560 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination. more Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Although there is interest in using oral turmeric for JIA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this condition. Knee pain. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for knee pain. Clinical research in individuals with knee pain not related to existing arthritis shows that taking turmeric extract (TurmXTRA 60N; Inventia Healthcare Ltd. and Laila Nutraceuticals) 250 mg, providing 60% curcuminoids, once daily for 90 days modestly reduces pain associated with walking 80 meters when compared with placebo. The time taken to walk 80 meters and to climb nine steps was reduced by 4-5 seconds ( 105396 ). more Lichen planus. Evidence is conflicting on whether turmeric is beneficial for lichen planus. A meta-analysis of several small, heterogeneous, mostly low-quality clinical and observational studies in adults with oral lichen planus shows that oral or topical curcumin with or without corticosteroids for 2-12 weeks does not improve erythema, lesion size, or pain when compared with control ( 113605 ). Similarly, a network meta-analysis of small clinical trials in patients with oral lichen planus shows that applying topical turmeric gel does not improve symptoms, clinical resolution, clinical scores, or reduce pain when compared with other available interventions ( 111640 ). However, small individual clinical studies have shown some benefit in using turmeric orally or topically for lichen planus. A small clinical study shows that taking a specific turmeric extract (Curcumin C3 Complex, Sabinsa Corporation) containing curcuminoids 6000 mg daily in three divided doses for 12 days can reduce erythema and ulceration associated with lichen planus when compared with placebo ( 81109 ). Another small clinical study shows that taking a nanocurcumin product (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg orally once daily for 1 month reduces oral lichen planus lesion size, pain, and burning similarly to prednisolone 10 mg taken orally once daily for 1 month ( 104961 ). Additionally, a small clinical study shows that applying turmeric twice daily for 4 months reduces burning, pain, and lesion size when compared to baseline. Turmeric reduces these outcomes similarly to topical ashwagandha or aloe vera ( 115931 ). more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for metabolic syndrome. Research is conflicting on how turmeric, curcumin, and other formulations affect various measures of metabolic syndrome. Some clinical research and a meta-analysis of 13 clinical studies in patients with metabolic syndrome show that taking turmeric or curcumin decreases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, waist circumference by 2 cm, fasting blood glucose by 9 mg/dL, and diastolic blood pressure by 3 mmHg and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 5 mg/dL when compared with placebo. However, other research shows that turmeric or curcumin have no effect on body weight, lipids, blood pressure, or blood glucose when compared with placebo ( 98999 , 99311 , 105400 , 109284 , 111347 , 112118 ). The validity of these effects is limited by high heterogeneity within the included studies and incomplete information about randomization and blinding. Studies have used turmeric, curcumin, and curcumin extract 80-2400 mg, in divided doses, daily for 4-12 weeks, nano-curcumin 80 mg daily for 12 weeks, or calebin A (CurCousin, Sabinsa), which is a constituent of turmeric, 25 mg twice daily for 3 months ( 98999 , 99311 , 105400 , 109284 , 111347 , 112118 ). Also, taking crude or phosphorylated curcuminoids 1 gram daily for 6 weeks does not improve sleep or reduce weight in these patients ( 105397 ). more Migraine headache. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial for migraine headache. A small clinical trial in females with regular migraines shows that taking curcumin 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces the severity and duration, but not the frequency, of migraine headaches when compared with placebo. In individuals taking curcumin, the duration of headache per month was reduced by approximately 10.3 hours from baseline ( 107116 ). more Myocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial for reducing myocardial injury following a MI. Clinical research in patients with an acute MI shows that taking curcuminoids 500 mg plus piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg daily (Sami Labs) for 8 weeks does not improve ejection fraction, serum levels of cardiac troponin 1, blood pressure, levels of fasting blood glucose, or kidney function parameters when compared to placebo. However, there were some modest benefits on levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, and certain liver enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ( 107115 ). The validity of this study is limited by its short duration and relatively small sample size. more Obesity. Oral turmeric might modestly improve weight loss, although any effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Multiple meta-analyses of small, mostly low-quality clinical studies in adults with a variety of comorbid conditions show that taking various forms and doses of turmeric or curcumin results in an average weight loss of about 0.6-1 kg, a decrease in body mass index (BMI) of about 0.2-0.5 kg/m2, and a decrease in waist circumference of about 1.3 cm when compared with control ( 102345 , 111351 , 111352 ). A sub-analysis of dose and duration shows that a reduction in waist circumference only occurs with curcumin daily doses above 1000 mg, and duration of treatment longer than 8 weeks ( 102345 ). more Oral submucous fibrosis. Small studies suggest that topical or oral curcumin might be beneficial for oral submucous fibrosis. However, the research is heterogenous with respect to outcomes, comparators, and the turmeric preparations, doses, and routes of administration utilized. A meta-analysis of 3 small clinical trials shows that turmeric modestly improves mouth opening when compared with control. In addition, a systematic review of 11 studies shows that turmeric improves overall symptoms, including mouth opening, tongue protrusion, burning sensation, and cheek flexibility. However, studies were small with short duration and used variable dosing strategies. Most trials have studied oral turmeric 300-400 mg, either alone or with black pepper 100 mg or piperine 5 mg, for 3-6 months. Less commonly, turmeric was provided in lozenge form ( 105399 ). Also, a network meta-analysis suggests that the turmeric constituent curcumin with or without piperine is most the effective for reducing tongue protrusion when compared indirectly with various medical and antioxidant therapies; however, this analysis suggests that curcumin does not rank among the most effective interventions for improving mouth opening, burning sensation, or cheek flexibility ( 113514 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific oral product containing curcumin 300 mg and piperine 5 mg (Turmix tablets, Sanat Products), three times daily for 12 weeks, improves mouth opening, burning sensation, and tongue protrusion when compared with baseline, but not when compared with an antioxidant product containing alpha-lipoic acid, beta-carotene, copper, lycopene, selenium, and zinc. Mouth opening is further improved by concurrent use of a mouthwash (Turmix mouthwash, Sanat Products), containing 0.1% w/v turmeric extract (standardized to 95% curcumin), with thymol, eucalyptol, clove oil, mentha oil, and tea tree oil, twice daily for 12 weeks ( 102347 ). A small clinical study shows that applying topical curcumin gel (Curenext, Abbott Laboratories) 5 mg daily in 3-4 divided doses for 6 weeks, in combination with oral physical therapy, improves mouth opening similarly to using an aloe vera gel in combination with oral physical therapy. However, decreases in burning sensation are greater with aloe gel than curcumin gel ( 104967 ). It is not clear whether the gels, oral physical therapy, or the combination of both is responsible for the outcome. Finally, clinical research shows that applying a paste providing turmeric and holy basil 10 grams each, mixed in 10 mL of honey, to the oral mucosa 4 times daily for 3 months modestly improves mouth opening, tongue protrusion, and burning sensation and reduces the presence of fibrous bands when compared with taking a vitamin B supplement. There was no effect on the shape of the uvula ( 113325 ). more Pain (acute). Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in adults with acute musculoskeletal pain shows that taking a specific combination product containing turmeric and Boswellia serrata extracts in black sesame oil (Rhuleave-K; Arjuna Natural Private Ltd.) 1000 mg daily for 7 days is as effective as acetaminophen 1000 mg daily for pain relief, onset of pain relief, and onset of maximal pain relief ( 109287 ). This study is limited by its lack of blinding and placebo control. Additionally, the dose of acetaminophen used in this study is below the standard recommended daily dose. more Periodontitis. There is limited evidence on the oral or topical use of turmeric or its constituent curcumin in patients with periodontitis. A meta-analysis of heterogenous clinical studies in patients with chronic periodontitis suggests that use of local delivery gel products, usually turmeric 2% or a specific product containing curcumin (Curenext), modestly reduces pocket depth when compared with routine products, such as chlorhexidine. However, limited research suggests that curcumin products do not affect plaque or gingivitis measures, and curcumin irrigation does not affect pocket depth based on limited research ( 107108 ). A small preliminary clinical study in patients with severe chronic periodontitis shows that placing curcumin gel 2 mg on one side of the mouth along with scaling and root planing (SRP) reduces plaque and probing pocket depth, but not gingival index, when compared with SRP alone ( 101339 ). The use of oral curcumin has also been investigated. A small clinical trial in patients with gingivitis and mild periodontitis shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg daily after breakfast for 4 weeks reduces the severity of gingivitis and gingival bleeding, but not plaque, when compared with placebo ( 104146 ). more Physical performance. It is unclear if oral turmeric may be beneficial for improving physical performance in older adults. A very small clinical study in moderately functioning, sedentary adults over age 65 with low-grade chronic inflammation shows that that taking a specific turmeric extract (Curcumin C3 Complex, Sabinsa Corporation) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve measures of physical function, walking speed, or muscle strength when compared with placebo ( 111357 ). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect any possible differences between groups. more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Small clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin may improve some metabolic parameters in patients with PCOS, but these improvements may not be considered clinically significant. Clinical research in patients with PCOS shows that taking curcumin 500 mg one to three times daily for 6-12 weeks improves some metabolic parameters ( 104968 , 105394 , 106795 ). Conversely, a small clinical study in patients aged 18 to 45 with PCOS in Iran shows that taking curcumin 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fasting glucose but does not improve other metabolic parameters when compared with placebo. Taking curcumin also did not improve testosterone levels or hirsutism scores ( 111355 ). Meta-analyses show that taking curcumin modestly decreases body mass index (BMI) and improves measures of glycemic control, including fasting glucose and insulin resistance, and levels of total cholesterol when compared with placebo or metformin alone. However, effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were mixed and there was no effect on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels ( 105394 , 106795 , 110219 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking curcumin decreases plasma dehydroepiandrosterone and fasting plasma glucose levels when compared with placebo ( 104968 ). Curcumin has also been evaluated in combination therapy. Some clinical research in adults with PCOS also shows that taking nano-curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80-240 mg daily for 3 months in combination with metformin 1500 mg daily modestly improves some metabolic parameters including fasting insulin, insulin resistance, as well as HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with metformin alone or placebo alone ( 106060 , 116944 ). Furthermore, combination therapy with metformin also showed slight improvements in fasting blood glucose and body weight when compared with placebo ( 116944 ). Clinical research in patients with PCOS shows that taking curcumin 500 mg one to three times daily for 6-12 weeks improves some metabolic parameters ( 104968 , 105394 , 106795 ). Conversely, a small clinical study in patients aged 18 to 45 with PCOS in Iran shows that taking curcumin 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fasting glucose but does not improve other metabolic parameters when compared with placebo. Taking curcumin also did not improve testosterone levels or hirsutism scores ( 111355 ). Meta-analyses show that taking curcumin modestly decreases body mass index (BMI) and improves measures of glycemic control, including fasting glucose and insulin resistance, and levels of total cholesterol when compared with placebo or metformin alone. However, effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were mixed and there was no effect on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels ( 105394 , 106795 , 110219 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking curcumin decreases plasma dehydroepiandrosterone and fasting plasma glucose levels when compared with placebo ( 104968 ). more Postoperative pain. Small clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may modestly reduce pain in various postoperative recovery settings. One small clinical study in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy shows that taking curcumin 2 grams daily reduces postoperative pain, fatigue, and the need for analgesics by the second postoperative week when compared with placebo ( 81099 ). In patients undergoing surgery for inguinal hernia and/or hydrocele, taking curcumin 1.2 grams daily for 5 days reduces inflammation and tenderness by the sixth postoperative day when compared with placebo ( 81206 ). Curcumin was taken in 3-4 divided doses daily in these studies. Finally, taking a single dose of curcumin 200 mg after surgical removal of impacted third molars modestly reduces acute postoperative pain when compared with taking mefenamic acid 500 mg ( 99305 ). more Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral turmeric may be beneficial for improving symptoms of PMS. Some preliminary clinical research in patients with PMS shows that taking curcumin 100 mg twice daily, starting 7 days prior to menstruation and continuing for 3 days after menstruation, improves physical, behavioral, and mood symptoms, as well as overall severity of symptoms, when compared with placebo ( 97433 ). Conversely, in university students aged 18 to 24 in Iran with mild to severe PMS and primary dysmenorrhea, a clinical study shows that taking a specific combination product containing curcumin 500 mg plus extract from black pepper 5 mg (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) daily, starting 7 days prior to menstruation and continuing for 3 days after menstruation for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles, does not improve the severity of symptoms when compared with placebo ( 106805 ). more Prostate cancer. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of prostate cancer. One small clinical study shows that taking curcumin 1.8 grams orally three times daily for 7 days, starting 4 days prior to docetaxel and prednisone treatment and continuing for up to 6 cycles, reduces PSA levels by at least half in 59% of patients when compared to baseline. Also, all patients with measurable lesions showed at least stable disease after treatment, and 40% of patients showed partial response when compared with baseline ( 96132 ). It is unclear if the addition of turmeric is beneficial when compared with docetaxel and prednisone alone. In contrast, an additional small clinical trial shows that taking curcumin 6 grams daily for 7 days every 3 weeks, starting four days before docetaxel, does not improve PSA levels or progression-free or overall survival when compared with docetaxel alone ( 105392 ). more Psoriasis. Evidence is limited to one small study of topical use in patients with scalp psoriasis. Preliminary clinical research in adults with scalp psoriasis shows that applying a tonic of turmeric to the scalp twice daily for 9 weeks modestly improves overall symptoms and quality of life when compared with a placebo tonic ( 97429 ). more Quality of life. Some preliminary clinical research suggests that oral curcumin might improve quality of life in patients with various chronic conditions. Small or low-quality clinical trials in various patient populations show that taking curcumin improves at least some measures of quality of life when compared with placebo. Research has been conducted in patients with cancer, sulfur mustard-induced chronic pruritus, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Studies have evaluated curcumin 2250 mg once daily for 6 months, a specific combination product (C3 Complex, Sami Labs LTD) containing curcumin 500-1000 mg plus piperine (Bioperine) daily for 4-9 weeks, or a combination product (CU-FEO, Alfa Wasserman S.p.A.) containing curcumin 42 mg and fennel essential oil 25 mg per capsule twice daily for 60 days ( 81120 , 81176 , 97422 , 106799 , 107109 , 107111 ). Also, in patients with scalp psoriasis, applying a tonic of turmeric to the scalp twice daily for 9 weeks modestly improves quality of life when compared with a placebo tonic ( 97429 ). more Radiation dermatitis. It is unclear if oral or topical turmeric is beneficial for reducing the severity of radiation dermatitis. A meta-analysis of 4 clinical studies in patients with breast cancer shows that taking curcumin 500-2000 mg three times daily for 3-7 weeks or applying curcumin gel 500 mg three times daily for 7 weeks reduces the radiation dermatitis severity score by about 0.5 points (on a 4-point scale) when compared with placebo or other control ( 111354 ). The validity of this analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. However, a small clinical study in patients with breast cancer shows that taking nanocurcumin 80 mg twice daily during and for up to 2 weeks after treatment does not reduce skin reaction severity overall, but does modestly reduce pain, when compared with taking placebo. Also, there was a small reduction in skin reaction severity near the end of the study. All patients also used aloe vera leaf as part of the hospital protocol ( 109281 ). Another small preliminary clinical study in head and neck cancer patients shows that a specific cream (Vicco turmeric cream, Vicco Laboratories) containing turmeric and sandalwood oil, applied 5 times daily during radiation therapy, seems to reduce frequency and severity of radiation dermatitis when compared with baby oil ( 99307 ). more Radiation proctopathy. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for preventing proctitis or cystitis in patients receiving radiotherapy for prostate cancer. A small clinical study in patients with prostate cancer shows that taking a specific nanocurcumin product (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 120 mg daily, for 3 days before and also during a course of radiotherapy, does not reduce the occurrence of proctitis or cystitis when compared with placebo ( 100259 ). This study may have been underpowered to detect small treatment effects. more Respiratory tract infections. Although there is interest in using oral turmeric for various respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and the common cold, it has not been clinically evaluated. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Small clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may modestly improve some symptoms of RA. Meta-analyses of small clinical trials in patients with RA show that taking curcumin alone or with other treatments modestly reduces overall RA symptoms, pain, and markers of inflammation when compared with control groups, including placebo or other treatments. However, some research shows that there is no beneficial effect on tender or swollen joint count from the limited available clinical research ( 109280 , 111358 ), while other research shows that there is a benefit ( 112117 ). Clinical studies have evaluated curcumin 120-1200 mg daily for 2 weeks to 3 months ( 11149 , 18205 , 96129 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the small size of the studies, and in some cases, the lack of a comparator group. more Sarcopenia. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in elderly patients with sarcopenia shows that taking a specific slow-release product containing turmeric, protein, carbohydrate, and fiber (Cureit, Aurea Biolabs), 500 mg orally daily for 3 months, increases handgrip strength by about 1% and distance walked before feeling tired by about 6% when compared with placebo. It also increases weightlifting capacity by about 6% from baseline, compared with a 5% decrease from baseline in those taking placebo ( 104973 ). It is unclear whether these small changes are clinically meaningful. more Schizophrenia. Although there is interest in using oral turmeric for improving cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this use. Sepsis. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial in patients with sepsis. A small clinical trial in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with sepsis shows that a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina), 80 mg dissolved in water and administered via gastric tube following lavage twice daily for 10 days does not affect length of ICU stay, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, blood pressure, or heart rate when compared with placebo ( 108873 ). more Smoking cessation. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with a history of smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily for at least 3 years shows that taking a specific combination product containing turmeric 50 mg, ashwagandha, Indian gooseberry, tribulus, bacopa, Albizia lebbeck, licorice, clove, ginger, cowhage, and holy basil (Smotect, Smotect India) daily for 3 months reduces the number of cigarettes smoked by approximately 3 per day when compared with placebo. This product also reduces levels of alveolar carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin but does not improve lung capacity ( 112115 ). However, only data from patients who completed treatment were analyzed, which limits the validity of this study. It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with a history of smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily for at least 3 years shows that taking a specific combination product containing turmeric 100 mg, ashwagandha, Indian gooseberry, tribulus, bacopa, Albizia lebbeck, licorice, clove, ginger, cowhage, and holy basil (Smotect, Smotect India) twice daily for 3 months reduces the number of cigarettes smoked by approximately 3 per day when compared with placebo. This product also reduces levels of alveolar carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin but does not improve lung capacity ( 112115 ). However, only data from patients who completed treatment were analyzed, which limits the validity of this study. It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination. more Stress. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for reducing occupational stress in healthy adults. A small clinical trial in healthy adults with occupational stress-related anxiety and fatigue shows that taking a specific type of turmeric (CurQfen, Akay Flavours and Aromatics Pvt Ltd.) that contains fenugreek dietary fiber for improved bioavailability at a dose of 500 mg twice daily for 30 days reduces stress and fatigue and improves quality of life when compared with placebo, and also when compared with a standard curcumin supplement with lower bioavailability ( 99308 ). more Stroke. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for stroke. A small clinical study conducted in Iran in adults with a recent ischemic stroke shows that taking curcumin 500 mg and piperine, a pepper constituent, 5 mg (Sami Lans, India) daily for 12 weeks reduces carotid intima-media thickness, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, but does not improve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or quality-of-life indicators when compared with placebo ( 113601 ). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons which can lead studies to erroneously show differences between treatment groups. more Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There is limited evidence on the oral use of turmeric in adults with lupus nephritis. Preliminary clinical research in adults with lupus nephritis shows that taking turmeric 1.5 grams daily in three divided doses for 3 months reduces systolic blood pressure and improves kidney function when compared to baseline ( 81104 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Tuberculosis. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial in patients receiving treatment for tuberculosis. A small clinical study in adults receiving antituberculosis treatment shows that taking a formulation containing turmeric 0.5 grams and Tinospora cordifolia 0.5 grams twice daily for 4 months can reduce levels of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum and improve lesion healing when compared with antituberculosis treatment alone. Also, liver toxicity associated with the antituberculosis treatment seems to be reduced when administered with this formulation ( 80424 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, Tinospora cordifolia, or the combination. more Ulcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral or rectal turmeric, or its constituent, curcumin, is beneficial in adults with ulcerative colitis. Although two small clinical studies in adults with ulcerative colitis show that taking oral turmeric extract 2-3 grams daily for 1-6 months improves the rate of remission and reduces relapse rate ( 79966 , 97423 ), a meta-analysis of these studies and one additional clinical study shows that turmeric does not improve remission rates when compared with placebo ( 99000 ). A specific product (Cur-Cure, Bara Herbs Inc) was used in some of these studies. Reasons for the conflicting findings are unclear, but may be due to small patient populations, concerns about blinding, and the inclusion of patients who were also taking immunomodulating drugs. It may also be due to differences in how a study measures remission. A meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis shows that adding oral curcumin 0.5-3 grams daily to standard treatment for 1-6 months may improve clinical remission rates, but not endoscopic remission rates, when compared with placebo ( 108872 ). However, the validity of this finding is limited by the small number of studies that evaluated endoscopic remission. A small clinical study shows that administering an enema form of turmeric extract (NCB-02, Himalaya Drug Company) as 20 mL, containing turmeric extract 140 mg, daily for 8 weeks increases response rate from 50% to about 93% and increases remission rate from about 31% to 71% when compared with placebo in patients with active ulcerative colitis. However, patients using the turmeric extract enema for shorter durations did not improve when compared with placebo ( 89729 ). Turmeric has also been investigated in combination with the Mediterranean diet. A small clinical trial shows that taking curcumin (VeNatura Curcumin Supplement) 800 mg twice daily while following the Mediterranean diet for 8 weeks is no more effective for improving ulcerative colitis symptom severity than following the Mediterranean diet without supplemental curcumin ( 113339 ). more Uveitis. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial for uveitis. Observational research in patients with acute non-infectious uveitic macular edema shows that taking a specific hydrophilic curcumin product (Cucrcuwin, Diabec, Alfa Intes) 60 mg twice daily for 6 months, in conjunction with standard corticosteroid treatment, and then alone for an additional 6 months, modestly improves best corrected visual acuity, but not macular thickness or intraocular pressure, when compared with standard treatment alone for 6 months ( 107110 ). more Wound healing. Although there is interest in using topical turmeric for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this condition. Chemotherapy-induced constipation . It is unclear if oral curcumin reduces symptoms of chemotherapy-induced constipation. A small clinical study in patients with various forms of cancer receiving standard chemotherapy for that cancer type shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg twice daily for 9 weeks does not reduce symptoms of constipation when compared with placebo ( 107111 ). more More evidence is needed to rate turmeric for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Turmeric products providing up to 8 grams of curcumin have been safely used for up to 2 months ( 10453 , 11144 , 11150 , 17953 , 79085 , 89720 , 89721 , 89724 , 89728 , 101347 )( 81036 , 101349 , 107110 , 107116 , 107117 , 107118 , 107121 , 109278 , 109283 , 114899 ) and products providing up to 1500 mg of curcumin daily have been safely used for up to 12 months ( 114898 ). Additionally, turmeric in doses up to 3 grams daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 3 months ( 102350 , 104146 , 104148 , 113357 , 114906 ). ...when used topically and appropriately ( 11148 ).

Standardization &amp; Formulation An evaluation of randomly selected turmeric products available in the United States found that turmeric root products contain 2.5-fold higher concentrations of lead than turmeric-derived curcuminoid extracts ( 97426 ). A specific turmeric extract (NCB-02, Himalaya Drug Company), which has been used in an enema, is standardized to 72% curcumin, 18.08% demethoxycurcumin, and 9.42% bisdemethoxycurcumin ( 89729 ). A specific turmeric extract (Acumin, Aurea Biolabs Ltd) based on a natural turmeric matrix contains 50% curcuminoids by weight ( 96129 ). Another turmeric extract (C3 complex, Sami Labs LTD), which has been used orally, is standardized to 95% curcuminoids comprised of 70-80% curcumin, 15-25% demethoxycurcumin, and 2.5-6.5% bisdemethoxycurcumin ( 81109 ). A specific turmeric extract (Meriva, Indena), marketed as a phytosomal formulation, is standardized to contain 20% curcuminoids (providing 75% curcumin) complexed with soy phosphatidylcholine in a 1:2 weight ratio ( 17953 , 80988 , 97431 , 106062 ). Another specific turmeric extract (BCM-95, Arjuna Natural Extracts) has been standardized to contain 86% to 91% total curcuminoids and 7% to 8% turmeric oils ( 89719 , 89728 , 96127 , 96130 , 105398 ). This extract is used in two products used in clinical research (Curamin and CuraMed). CuraMed contains 552-578 mg of BCM-95 providing 500 mg curcuminoids, 376 mg of curcumin, 124 mg demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin, and 49-52 mg volatile oil.

Good dietary sources of vanadium include mushrooms, shellfish, black pepper, parsley, dill seed, grains and grain products, and beverages such as beer, wine, and artificially sweetened drinks ( 7135 ). Drinking water can also contain trace amounts of vanadium ( 3011 ). An average diet provides 6 to 18 mcg vanadium daily. Antidiabetes effects Some evidence suggests that vanadium can mimic the actions of insulin, possibly by causing phosphorylation of insulin receptor proteins. Vanadium activates the receptor, stimulates glucose oxidation and transport, inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue, stimulates glycogen synthesis in the liver, inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis, inhibits intestinal glucose transport; and increases glucose uptake, utilization, and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle ( 3012 , 3013 ). It appears to augment the effects of insulin in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes, but might not have an effect in type 1 diabetes ( 482 ). Preliminary evidence suggests that L-glutamic acid gamma-monohydroxamate might activate endogenous vanadium, facilitating glucose metabolism through conversion of intracellular vanadium into an active insulinomimetic compound ( 388 ). Bone effects Vanadium appears to be important in normal bone growth and as a cofactor for various enzyme reactions. Vanadium inhibits ATPases, phosphatases, and phosphoryl-transfer enzymes ( 7135 ). Cardiovascular effects Vanadium seems to have cardiovascular effects. There is some evidence that prolonged administration might be associated with dose-dependent increases in blood pressure ( 3012 ).

Although there has been interest in using oral vanadium for improving athletic performance, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vanadium for this purpose. Cancer. Although there has been interest in using oral vanadium for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vanadium for this purpose. Diabetes. Small clinical studies suggest that high doses of oral vanadium may improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes; however, these high doses may be unsafe. It is unclear if lower doses of vanadium have the same effects. Five very small clinical studies including fewer than 40 patients with type 2 diabetes show that taking high oral doses of vanadyl sulfate (50-75 mg twice daily; 31-46 mg elemental vanadium daily) for up to 6 weeks can improve hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity and might reduce blood glucose levels when compared to baseline ( 3055 , 3056 , 3057 , 12557 , 12558 ). However, prolonged use of these high doses might not be safe ( 7135 ). It is not known if lower doses have the same benefit. more Hyperlipidemia. Although there has been interest in using oral vanadium for hyperlipidemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vanadium for this purpose. Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral vanadium is beneficial in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. A very small clinical study in overweight or obese adults with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking vanadyl sulfate 50 mg twice daily for 30 days does not improve insulin sensitivity or glucose metabolism when compared with placebo ( 92819 ). more Tuberculosis.

Vanadium is safe when taken in amounts below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1.8 mg daily ( 7135 ). Possibly Unsafe when used orally in high doses. Taking more than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1.8 mg daily can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and theoretically, kidney toxicity ( 7135 ). In some cases, patients with diabetes have used very high doses (100 mg daily) safely for up to 4 weeks ( 3055 , 3056 , 3057 ). However, there is concern that prolonged use of high doses might cause serious side effects including kidney damage ( 7135 ). Doses of 22.5 mg daily for five months can cause cramps and diarrhea ( 3012 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts found in foods ( 7135 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of vanadium when used in amounts greater than those typically found in foods. PREGNANCY: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts found in foods ( 7135 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in medicinal amounts. Epidemiological research has found that increased urinary levels of vanadium are associated with an increased risk of both term and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM). When comparing tertiles of urinary vanadium levels, patients in the middle tertile had 1.66 times the risk of term PROM when compared with the lowest tertile, and those in the highest tertile had 3.75 times the risk. For preterm PROM (rupture prior to 37 weeks' gestation), those in the highest tertile had an 8.14 times increased risk when compared with those in the lowest tertile ( 99052 ). Epidemiological research has also found that higher prenatal serum levels of vanadium are associated with impaired fetal growth, particularly in male newborns. The risk appears greatest with vanadium exposure in the second trimester ( 102096 ). LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts found in foods ( 7135 ).

Intramuscular vitamin B12 is effective for patients with this condition. Administering intramuscular vitamin B12 (hydroxocobalamin) 1 mg daily for 10 days, followed by monthly injections for the remainder of a patient's life, is effective for treating familial selective vitamin B12 malabsorption (Imerslund-Grasbeck disease) ( 15 , 82862 ). more Vitamin B12 deficiency. Administering vitamin B12 orally, intramuscularly, or intranasally is effective for preventing and treating vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency has varying definitions but is often defined as vitamin B12 (cobalamin) levels less than 180-200 pmol/L (or 240 pg/mL). Some believe that only intramuscular vitamin B12 is effective for treating vitamin B12 deficiency. However, clinical research shows that oral therapy increases cobalamin levels similarly to intramuscular administration, even in patients with pernicious anemia or malabsorption, if a high enough dose is given ( 2909 , 2911 , 2915 , 9335 , 82832 ) ( 82836 , 82949 , 82860 , 103976 , 103972 , 107141 , 107144 ). Some evidence suggests that the most effective oral dose is between 647-1032 mcg daily ( 13106 ). However, in certain situations, intramuscular treatment might be more appropriate. Guidelines by the British Committee for Standards in Hematology recommend only intramuscular vitamin B12 for initial treatment of severe vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with pernicious anemia, malabsorption disorders, or neurological involvement ( 94722 ). Intramuscular vitamin B12 is also appropriate in patients with diarrhea or vomiting and those likely to be nonadherent ( 103972 ). Vitamin B12 deficiency is especially common in older adults, primarily due to lack of intrinsic factor and malabsorption ( 2915 , 2919 , 9335 ). Daily supplementation with vitamin B12 50-100 mcg might be needed to correct deficiency ( 10126 ), while daily doses of 25-37.5 mcg help to maintain normal levels over time ( 9335 ). In addition to supplements, foods such as milk and bread fortified with vitamin B12 can be used and are approximately 55% to 60% absorbed by people over 60 years of age ( 10124 ). Vitamin B12 deficiency is also common in patients that have had gastric surgery, including gastrectomy and bariatric surgery ( 107144 , 107145 ). Taking vitamin B12 in the doses found in multivitamins or generic vitamin B supplements does not seem to prevent vitamin B12 deficiency following bariatric surgery ( 107145 ). However, taking methylcobalamin 500 mcg daily is beneficial for treating vitamin B12 deficiency associated with a total gastrectomy and taking cyanocobalamin 5000 mcg daily is beneficial for preventing vitamin B12 deficiency following gastric bypass ( 107144 ). Other people at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency include strict vegetarians who eat no animal products (vegans) and people with increased vitamin B12 requirements associated with pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, and hepatic and kidney disease. Moderate consumption of animal products may not be sufficient to restore and maintain vitamin B12 levels, especially in adolescents who had consumed macrobiotic (vegan type) diets for the first 6 years of life. High dietary intake of vitamin B12 or supplements is usually needed in order to restore and maintain optimal vitamin B12 levels in these adolescents ( 10125 ). more Likely Effective Cyanide poisoning. Intravenous hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) is likely effective as an antidote for patients with suspected or known cyanide toxicity due to inhalation, ingestion, or skin exposure. Treatment of cyanide poisoning with hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) up to 10 grams has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recommended by the Australian Resuscitation Council ( 82870 , 82905 , 82906 ). Hydroxocobalamin is also FDA-approved for treating cyanide toxicity during pregnancy ( 82904 ). more Possibly Effective Canker sores. Sublingual or topical vitamin B12 seems to reduce canker sore symptoms. Clinical research in patients with canker sores shows that applying a topical ointment containing vitamin B12 500 mcg in four divided doses daily for 2 days reduces pain levels by 80% when compared with a control ointment not containing vitamin B12 ( 96176 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking vitamin B12 1000 mcg sublingually daily for 6 months reduces the duration of canker sore outbreaks, the number of ulcers, and level of pain when compared with placebo in patients with normal vitamin B12 levels ( 17242 ). more Hyperhomocysteinemia. Oral vitamin B12 in combination with folic acid, and sometimes with vitamin B6, reduces homocysteine levels. While folic acid 0.5-5 mg daily lowers fasting homocysteine levels by an average of 25%, adding vitamin B12 0.5 mg daily produces an additional decrease of about 7% on average ( 6883 , 9400 , 9401 , 9405 , 9409 , 50145 , 107136 ). Vitamin B12 in combination with folic acid and other vitamins also reduces homocysteine levels in patients with kidney failure, sickle cell disease, and those receiving nitrous oxide general anesthesia ( 1489 , 6883 , 6884 , 7289 , 7881 , 9324 , 9414 , 9415 , 9416 , 9481 , 82941 ). Some researchers recommend routine use of vitamin B12 with homocysteine-lowering regimens to avoid the risk of neuropathy in people with undetected vitamin B12 deficiency ( 9405 ). Using vitamin B12 alone has a limited effect on homocysteine levels, and probably only in those people with vitamin B12 deficiency ( 2147 , 9410 , 9512 ). Hyperhomocysteinemia is considered by some to be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, recurrent thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke ( 1899 , 2147 , 3323 , 9402 , 9405 , 9408 , 9409 ). Clinical research suggests that supplementation with folic acid, pyridoxine, and vitamin B12 decreases homocysteine levels and reduces the atherosclerosis progression in patients at risk for atherosclerosis when compared with placebo ( 50133 , 50056 , 82806 ). However, other research suggests that elevated homocysteine levels may be a marker, as opposed to a cause, of vascular disease ( 11387 , 11388 ). A 5 µmol/L increase in plasma homocysteine increases the risk of cerebrovascular disease by 50%, and the odds of coronary heart disease by 60% and 80% in males and females, respectively ( 9407 , 9411 ). However, it is not clear if reducing homocysteine levels results in reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality ( 1489 , 6883 , 6884 , 9400 , 9405 , 9409 , 96417 ). Folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 supplementation can reduce total homocysteine from 13.4 to 11 µmol/L. However, this reduction does not seem improve endothelial function or help with secondary prevention of death or myocardial infarction, and some research even suggests an increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk ( 11387 , 13482 , 50373 , 50314 , 97619 ). There is also some debate about whether supplementation with homocysteine-lowering B vitamins can reduce the risk of stroke. A number of large clinical studies and meta-analyses show that supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, alone or in combination, does not reduce the risk of stroke in patients with CVD or impaired kidney function ( 11387 , 13482 , 50423 , 83050 , 96150 ). However, a more recent meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials including over 44,000 patients shows that B vitamin supplementation reduces the relative risk of stroke by 10% when compared with placebo in patients at risk or with a history of CVD ( 97619 ). Also, a meta-analysis in adults with a history of stroke shows that B vitamin supplementation modestly reduces the relative risk of stroke recurrence by 13% and vascular death by 11% when compared with placebo ( 107136 ). more Postherpetic neuralgia. Subcutaneous injections of vitamin B12 seem to reduce postherpetic neuralgia symptoms. Clinical research in patients with subacute herpetic neuralgia shows that subcutaneous injection of vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) 1000 mcg six times weekly for 4 weeks reduces pain when compared with oral vitamin B12 or subcutaneous lidocaine ( 90394 ). Another clinical study shows that administering local subcutaneous injections of methylcobalamin 1000 mcg plus lidocaine up to 20 mg daily for 12 injections over 14 days, starting within 7 days of the onset of subacute ophthalmic herpetic neuralgia, decreases the mean pain score by 63% to 79% when compared with intravenous lidocaine and intramuscular methylcobalamin. Less than 2 patients need to be treated to achieve a pain reduction to ≤3 out of 10. Healing of rash, itching, numbness, and tingling were also improved ( 96175 ). Additional clinical research in patients with postherpetic pain and itching shows that this same dosing regimen of subcutaneous vitamin B12 reduces pain and analgesic requirements when compared to baseline ( 90396 ). more Possibly Ineffective Age-related cognitive decline. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to improve cognitive function in older adults when used alone or in combination with other B vitamins. Taking vitamin B12 100-1000 mcg plus folic acid 400-2000 mcg, with or without vitamin B6 3-50 mg, daily for up to about 2 years does not seem to improve tests of cognitive function in adults aged 65 or older, most of whom do not report cognitive impairment at baseline ( 14392 , 50225 , 50510 , 90392 , 107140 ). Also, supplementation with vitamin B12 does not seem to improve cognitive function in elderly individuals with low vitamin B12 levels ( 12305 ). more Alzheimer disease. Oral vitamin B12, when used in combination with other B vitamins, does not seem to improve cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer disease. Clinical research in patients with probable Alzheimer disease using routine medication shows that taking vitamin B12 1 mg, folic acid 5 mg, and vitamin B6 25 mg daily for 18 months does not have a beneficial effect on cognitive function or the severity of disease when compared with placebo. In this study, all patients were consuming a folate-fortified diet ( 50319 ). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research in elderly adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia shows that taking vitamin B12, usually with other B vitamins, does not improve cognitive function ( 50510 ). Observational research has also found that higher vitamin B12 intake over 3 years in a population consuming a folate-fortified diet is not associated with a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer disease ( 15270 ). In contrast, preliminary clinical research in patients with probable Alzheimer disease who are not consuming a folate-fortified diet shows that taking vitamin B12 50 mcg daily plus folic acid 1.2 mg daily for 6 months modestly improves some measures of cognitive performance and decreases levels of homocysteine when compared with placebo ( 107150 ). More research is needed to determine if any changes in this latter study are clinically relevant. more Cataracts. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to reduce cataract development. Clinical research in women with existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at increased risk of CVD shows that taking a combination of folic acid 2.5 mg daily, vitamin B6 50 mg daily, and vitamin B12 1 mg daily for an average of 7.3 years does not reduce the risk of cataracts and seems to increase the risk of cataract extraction by 28% when compared with placebo ( 96149 ). more Circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to improve sleep disorders. Oral vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) does not seem to be effective for treating delayed sleep phase syndrome. Methylcobalamin 0.5-1 mg three times daily, with or without bright light therapy, also does not seem to help people with primary circadian rhythm sleep disorders ( 1344 , 1345 , 1346 , 1347 , 1348 ). more Cognitive impairment. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to be beneficial for older adults with cognitive impairment. A meta-analysis of clinical research in elderly adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia shows that taking vitamin B12, usually with other B vitamins, does not improve cognitive function ( 50510 ). One clinical trial in elderly people with memory complaints shows that taking a combination of B vitamins, including folic acid 0.8 mg, vitamin B12 0.5 mg, and vitamin B6 (form not specified) 20 mg daily for 24 months reduces cerebral atrophy in the gray matter regions associated with Alzheimer disease by up to seven-fold when compared with placebo. However, this protection does not occur in patients with the lowest average blood levels of homocysteine ( 90374 ). more Fall prevention. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to reduce the risk of falls. Clinical research shows that taking B vitamins, including folic acid 400 mcg and vitamin B12 500 mcg, daily for 2 years does not prevent falls when compared with placebo in elderly individuals also taking vitamin D ( 96148 ). more Osteoporosis. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures. Clinical research in elderly patients or patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease shows that taking vitamin B12 500 mcg and folic acid 0.4-2 mg, with or without vitamin B6 25 mg, daily for 2-3 years does not seem to reduce the risk for osteoporotic fractures when compared with placebo ( 90377 , 90393 ). A 5-7 year follow-up of this research has also found no benefit ( 103981 ). more Physical performance. Oral vitamin B12 does not seem to improve physical performance in older adults. Clinical research shows that taking B vitamins, including folic acid 400 mcg and vitamin B12 500 mcg, daily for 2 years does not increase hand strength or improve performance such as walking when compared with placebo in elderly individuals also taking vitamin D ( 96148 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A large-scale clinical study shows that taking vitamin B12 1000 mcg, folic acid 2.5 mg, and vitamin B6 50 mg daily, reduces the risk of developing AMD in females over 40 years of age with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at least three risk factors for CVD. Those who took this combination for an average of 7.3 years had a 34% reduced risk of developing AMD and a 41% reduced risk of visually significant AMD when compared with placebo ( 14620 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin B12, other ingredients, or the combination. more Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). It is unclear if high-dose intramuscular vitamin B12 improves the prognosis of ALS. A clinical study in patients with ALS symptoms for 3 years or less shows that intramuscular vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) 25-50 mg twice weekly for 3.5 years does not slow functional decline or increase the time until ventilation or death when compared with placebo. However, other clinical research in patients with early-stage ALS shows that intramuscular methylcobalamin 50 mg twice weekly for 16 weeks is associated with slower functional decline and a longer period of time until death or full ventilation when compared with placebo ( 104947 , 111556 ). These effects seem to be particularly notable in fine and gross motor skills, but not bulbar or respiratory functions. Furthermore, vitamin B12 and riluzole slowed clinical progression of ALS more than riluzole alone ( 111556 ). more Angioplasty. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Some evidence suggests that vitamin B12 400 mcg, folic acid 1 mg, and vitamin B6 10 mg daily can decrease the rate of restenosis in patients treated with balloon angioplasty ( 8009 , 9412 , 34540 ). However, this combination does not seem to be as effective for reducing restenosis in patients after coronary stenting ( 8009 ). An intravenous loading dose of folic acid, pyridoxine, and vitamin B12 followed by oral administration of folic acid 1.2 mg, pyridoxine 48 mg, and vitamin B12 60 mcg daily after bare metal coronary stenting also does not seem to reduce restenosis and might actually increase restenosis ( 12150 , 12151 , 34540 ). Due to the lack of evidence of benefit and potential for harm, this combination of vitamins should not be recommended for patients receiving coronary stents ( 12151 ). It is unclear if any effects are due to vitamin B12, other ingredients, or the combination. more Anxiety. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B12 for anxiety and panic attacks, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B12 for these uses. Asthma. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B12 for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B12 for this condition. Atherosclerosis. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. One small clinical study in patients with intermediate risk for coronary heart disease shows that taking vitamin B12 100 mcg, aged garlic extract 250 mg, folic acid 300 mcg, vitamin B6 12.5 mg, and L-arginine 100 mg daily for 12 months reduces coronary artery calcium progression when compared with placebo ( 88385 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin B12, other ingredients, or the combination. more Atopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if topical vitamin B12 reduces the severity of eczema. Preliminary clinical research shows that applying a specific topical vitamin B12 0.07% cream (Regividerm) twice daily reduces the extent and severity of atopic dermatitis when compared with placebo ( 15765 ). more Attention. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B12 for improving attention and focus, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B12 for this use. Cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 reduces overall cancer risk when used in combination with other B vitamins. An ancillary clinical study in middle-aged and elderly adults with cardiovascular disease shows that taking a combination of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) 0.02 mg, folic acid 0.56 mg, and vitamin B6 3 mg, with or without eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 400 mg plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 200 mg, for a median of 4.7 years does not reduce the risk of cancer when compared with placebo ( 90666 ). An additional secondary analysis of clinical research in patients recovering from stroke or transient ischemic attack shows that taking vitamin B12 500 mcg, folic acid 2 mg, and vitamin B6 25 mg daily for around 3.4 years does not reduce the risk of cancer when compared with placebo ( 90378 ). The validity of these findings is limited because the studies were not designed nor adequately powered to test for cancer risk. more Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral vitamin B12, taken along with other B vitamins, does not seem to improve secondary prevention of death or myocardial infarction in patients with CVD. However, it might slightly reduce the risk of stroke. Overall evidence from clinical research and meta-analyses shows that taking vitamin B12 in combination with folic acid and/or vitamin B6 does not seem to reduce the risk for secondary death or myocardial infarction in patients with or at risk for CVD ( 11387 , 13482 , 34540 , 50423 , 83050 , 90379 , 97619 ). In fact, some research suggests that long-term supplementation with vitamin B6, folic acid, and vitamin B12 for secondary prevention increases the risk of CVD by 20% despite lowering homocysteine levels by 30% ( 13482 ). However, other research shows that taking vitamin B12 in combination with other B vitamins modestly reduces the risk of stroke, although results are conflicting ( 11387 , 13482 , 50423 , 83050 , 96150 , 96165 , 97619 , 107136 ). It is unclear which specific combination of B vitamins, if any, might be optimal for reducing stroke risk and which patients are most likely to benefit. In 2001, prior to the publication of the highest quality research on this topic, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim stating that, as part of a well-balanced diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol, folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 may reduce the risk of vascular disease ( 102368 ). more Cervical cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 reduces cervical cancer risk. Some epidemiological evidence has found that increasing vitamin B12 intake from dietary and supplement sources, along with folic acid, thiamine, and riboflavin, might decrease the risk of precancerous cervical lesions ( 11074 ). Also, an analysis of two case control studies has found that increased intake of vitamin B12 is associated with a 75% reduced odds of cervical cancer ( 34609 ). more Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in patients receiving chemotherapy shows that a combination of B vitamins that includes vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) 1000 mcg, taken daily starting one week prior to treatment and finishing 12 weeks after treatment is completed, does not prevent peripheral neuropathy when compared with placebo ( 96173 ). more Child development. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for child development. Population research has found that daily dietary intake of less than 2.26 mcg vitamin B12 in the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of poorer outcomes in the offspring for some measures of speech and mathematics ability, including vocabulary at 24 months, combining words at 38 months, speech intelligibility at 6 years, and math comprehension between ages 8-11 years, when compared with dietary intakes of at least 2.26 mcg daily. There was no association between prenatal vitamin B12 intake and reading or spelling abilities, vocabulary at other ages, or full-scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) at ages 8 or 15 ( 107143 ). Furthermore, a very large clinical study in infants of pregnant adults, 71% of whom were deficient in vitamin B12 at baseline, shows that taking vitamin B12 50 mcg daily starting in early pregnancy (&lt;15 weeks gestation) until 6 months postpartum does not improve neurodevelopment as measured by language, motor, socioemotional, or cognitive scores at 12 months old and may worsen early motor performance at 8-12 weeks when compared with placebo. However, the negative effects on motor performance resolved by 6 and 12 months of age ( 112431 ). more Child growth. Oral vitamin B12 taken by pregnant adults does not seem to be beneficial for infant growth. A very large clinical study in infants of pregnant adults, 71% of whom were deficient in vitamin B12 at baseline, shows that taking vitamin B12 50 mcg daily starting in early pregnancy (&lt;15 weeks gestation) until 6 months postpartum does not improve the infant's linear growth, length, or weight at 12 months of age ( 112431 ). more Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 reduces the risk of COPD. Clinical research in patients with COPD shows that taking vitamin B12 500 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly improves endurance on the cycle ergometer, but does not improve oxygen consumption, when compared with placebo ( 96172 ). more Cognitive function. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A moderate-sized clinical study in healthy, middle-aged adults shows that taking a combination product containing vitamin B12, other B vitamins, bacopa, and gingko biloba twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve measures of memory, attention, cognition, mood, or stress reactivity when compared with placebo ( 111334 ). more Colorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 reduces colorectal cancer risk. Some epidemiological evidence has found that increased dietary intake of vitamin B12 is associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer ( 90383 ). However, preliminary clinical research shows that taking vitamin B12 1 mg, folic acid 2.5 mg, and vitamin B6 50 mg daily for up to 7.3 years does not reduce the risk of colorectal adenoma in females at high risk for cardiovascular disease ( 90389 ). Furthermore, a secondary analysis of clinical research in elderly patients suggests that taking vitamin B12 500 mcg and folic acid 400 mcg daily for 2 years might increase the risk of colorectal cancer when compared with placebo ( 90393 ). more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for patients with COVID-19. A small observational study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia has found that higher plasma vitamin B12 levels may be associated with an increased risk of transfer to intensive care or death than lower plasma levels. However, when multivariate regression was conducted, only patient age was associated with worsened outcomes. Additionally, the total study population was small, with only nine of 49 patients experiencing the worsened outcomes ( 107138 ). more Dementia. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 reduces the risk of developing dementia. A large cohort of Danish adults has found that vitamin B12 levels or intake does not seem to impact the risk of developing Alzheimer disease or other dementias ( 104922 ). However, vitamin B12 might be beneficial in specific patient populations. A small observational study in patients with Parkinson disease has found that higher vitamin B12 levels (648.5 ng/L) are associated with a lower risk of developing dementia when compared with lower vitamin B12 levels (452 ng/L) ( 103975 ). It is not yet known if supplementation with vitamin B12 reduces the risk for dementia in these patients. more Depression. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for reducing depression risk. A meta-analysis of epidemiological research has found that the highest dietary intake of vitamin B12 is associated with a 14% reduced risk of depression. However, in a sub-analysis, this association was not significant in males ( 107133 ). In contrast, one epidemiological study in older males included in the analysis has found that daily dietary intake of at least 4.79 mcg vitamin B12 is linked with a 58% lower risk of depression when compared with daily intake of less than 3.16 mcg. In this study, this inverse association was not observed in females ( 96168 ). Other observational research has found that low-normal serum vitamin B12 levels are associated with a 3.8 times increased risk for depression during pregnancy when compared with normal vitamin B12 levels ( 102384 ). It is unclear if increased intake of vitamin B12 through the diet or supplements reduces the risk for depression or is beneficial for treating symptoms of depression in any population. However, a meta-analysis of clinical research in elderly populations shows that supplementation with vitamin B12 100-1000 mcg daily, usually in combination with folic acid 400-2000 mcg daily, does not reduce symptoms of depression. Most individuals in these studies were not specifically diagnosed with depression ( 107140 ). more Diabetes. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 improves glycemic indices or prevents loss of skeletal muscle in patients with diabetes. A small clinical study in patients with diabetes in India who are stabilized on metformin and/or a sulfonylurea shows that taking vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) 500 mcg with or without folic acid 5 mg daily for 8 weeks seems to reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) by 1.3% to 1.5%, compared with a 0.3% increase with placebo ( 104917 ). This study is limited due its small sample size and lack of blinding. In elderly adults with type 2 diabetes, population research has found a lower dietary intake of vitamin B12 (average of 11.2 mcg daily) in individuals with a loss of skeletal muscle mass of at least 1.2%, compared with an average intake of 13.4 mcg daily in those with a skeletal muscle mass loss of less than 1.2%. However, further analysis determined that any relationship between vitamin B12 intake and loss of skeletal muscle mass was only significant in individuals with insufficient energy intake overall ( 107151 ). more Diabetic neuropathy. Small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin B12 may modestly improve pain in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Two small clinical studies in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy show that taking vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) 1-1.5 mg for 4-12 months modestly improves pain when compared with baseline or placebo ( 82841 , 104923 ). Some research also shows that vitamin B12 may be beneficial in combination with other ingredients. Studies have evaluated products containing vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin or cyanocobalamin), benfotiamine, and vitamin B6 daily for 9-12 weeks ( 82931 , 82939 ); and vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) 2 mg, folic acid (L-methylfolate) 3 mg, and vitamin B6 (pyridoxal-5'-phosphate) 35 mg (Metanx; Pamlab) daily for 24 weeks ( 90375 ). more Diarrhea. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for reducing diarrhea in children. Preliminary clinical research in children aged 6-30 months from low- and middle-income countries shows that taking vitamin B12 at twice the recommended dietary allowance, with or without folic acid, does not reduce the risk for diarrhea when compared with placebo ( 90391 ). more Fatigue. It is unclear if intramuscular vitamin B12 is beneficial for improving well-being in those with fatigue or tiredness. A small crossover trial in patients complaining of tiredness or fatigue shows that receiving intramuscular injections of vitamin B12 (hydroxocobalamin) 5 mg twice weekly for 2 weeks seems to improve general well-being and happiness, and has a trend toward improving fatigue, when compared with placebo ( 10127 ). The validity of this study is limited by a large drop-out rate and unstandardized outcome measures. more Hearing loss. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with adenosine triphosphate; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small observational study in adults with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss has found that taking vitamin B12 1.5 mg with adenosine triphosphate 300 mg daily for 8-16 weeks is associated with modestly reduced hearing loss at 4-6 months after starting treatment when compared with taking the combination for less than 8 weeks ( 104924 ). This finding is limited due to its observational nature and lack of a control group. more Hepatitis C. It is unclear if intramuscular vitamin B12 is beneficial for sustaining viral response in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. A small clinical study in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection shows that intramuscular vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) 5000 mcg every 4 weeks along with standard care improves sustained viral response when compared with standard of care alone ( 90386 ). more Hypertriglyceridemia. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for reducing triglyceride levels. Some evidence shows that taking vitamin B12 7.5 mcg with fish oil 5 grams might be superior to fish oil alone when used daily to reduce total serum cholesterol and triglycerides. This suggests vitamin B12 might have an independent effect in lowering serum cholesterol and triglycerides, but further investigation is needed to confirm this effect ( 8694 ). more Hypotension. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for treating hypotension. A meta-analysis of 3 observational studies in patients hospitalized with hypotension secondary to cardiac surgery vasoplegia suggests that administration of intravenous vitamin B12 (hydroxocobalamin) is associated with an 8 mmHg higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 1 hour but no change in vasopressor dosage at 1 hour or mortality rate when compared with methylene blue ( 112264 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the inclusion of only retrospective studies. more Infant development. It is unclear if taking oral vitamin B12 during pregnancy is beneficial for improving infant development. Giving oral vitamin B12 to infants does not seem to be beneficial. Clinical research shows that supplementation with vitamin B12 50 mcg daily from less than 14 weeks gestation until 6 weeks postpartum does not improve cognitive development in infants by 9 months of age when compared with placebo ( 96174 ). When these children were evaluated at 30 months of age, a very small benefit of vitamin B12 on expressive language was identified; however, there was no effect on cognition, receptive language, fine motor skills, or gross motor skills ( 100169 ). It is unknown whether a longer duration of postpartum supplementation or supplementation in specific populations might be beneficial. Vitamin B12 supplementation in infants has also been evaluated. A large clinical trial in marginally stunted Nepalese infants aged 6-11 months shows that giving vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) 2 mcg daily for 12 months reduces homocysteine levels, but does not improve motor or cognitive development, when compared with placebo ( 104926 ). more Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B12 for IBD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B12 for this condition. Lung cancer. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. The association between vitamin B12 and lung cancer is unclear. Some population research found no relationship between blood levels of vitamin B12 and lung cancer ( 9454 ). However, other observational research involving over 5,000 case-control pairs found that higher vitamin B12 levels are linked with an increased risk for lung cancer ( 102383 ). It is unclear if increased intake of vitamin B12, either through the diet or supplementation, directly affects the risk of lung cancer. more Male infertility. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A retrospective study in adult males with idiopathic and varicocele-related infertility suggests that taking a combination product containing vitamin B12 1.5 mcg, L-carnitine, acetyl L-carnitine, citric acid, selenium, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, zinc, and folic acid (Proxeed Plus) twice daily for 6 months is associated with improvements in ejaculate volume, sperm count, sperm concentration, total motility, and progressive motility in patients with idiopathic infertility when compared to baseline. However, improvement in sperm morphology was lacking. Furthermore, patients with more severe varicocele seem to benefit most, especially with regard to progressive motility ( 111296 ). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of comparator group. Further, it is unclear if these effects are due to vitamin B12, other ingredients, or the combination. more Mastalgia. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical trial in patients with mastalgia shows that taking a combination of vitamin B12 as methylcobalamin 100 mg, gamma-linolenic acid, and vitamin C daily for 12 weeks does not improve the proportion of patients with minimal or no pain when compared with placebo ( 111059 ). more Multiple sclerosis (MS). Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B12 for MS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B12 for this condition. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for NAFLD. A small clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking vitamin B12 1000 mcg daily for 12 weeks reduces serum levels of homocysteine but has no effect on serum aminotransferases, measures of steatosis, fibrosis scores, fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, measures of insulin resistance, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo ( 111555 ). more Pancreatic cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for reducing the risk of pancreatic cancer. Most population research has found that increased intake of vitamin B12, as a supplement or in the diet, is not associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer ( 9327 , 104927 ). However, a small, retrospective population study in which smoking and non-smoking adults recalled past eating habits found that increased dietary intake of vitamin B12 is associated with a 33% reduction in pancreatic cancer risk ( 97976 ). These conflicting findings may be related to study methodology, as well as the age, gender, or smoking status of the included patients. more Periodontitis. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin B12 for periodontitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin B12 for this condition. Peripheral neuropathy. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific product containing vitamin B12 3 mcg, folic acid 400 mcg, and uridine monophosphate 50 mg (Keltican) daily for 60 days reduces pain by 44% and decreases analgesic use by over 75% when compared to baseline in patients with peripheral neuropathy, including those with lumbar/lumbosacral radiculopathy, sciatic pain, and cervical radiculopathy ( 90384 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. Furthermore, it is unclear if the benefits are due to vitamin B12, other ingredients, or the combination. more Psoriasis. Topical vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that a specific cream containing vitamin B12 and avocado oil (Regividerm, Regeneratio Pharma AG) reduces symptoms of psoriasis as effectively as calcipotriol ointment (Psorcutan) after 12 weeks of therapy. The vitamin B12 combination cream also causes less irritation than calcipotriol ( 14909 ). It is unclear if the benefits are due to vitamin B12, other ingredients, or the combination. more Respiratory tract infections. A small study suggests that oral vitamin B12 does not reduce the rate of respiratory tract infections in children. Preliminary clinical research in children aged 6-30 months from low-and middle-income countries suggests that taking vitamin B12 at twice the recommended dietary allowance with or without folic acid does not reduce the risk for lower respiratory tract infections when compared with placebo ( 90391 ). more Schizophrenia. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research shows that taking a combination of vitamin B12 400 mcg and folic acid 2 mg daily for 16 weeks improves negative symptoms when compared with placebo in patients with schizophrenia who have persistent symptoms and a specific genetic variant of the folate transporter gene FOLHI. This variant normally results in reduced folate absorption. However, in patients without this genetic variant, folate is not beneficial with respect to negative symptom improvement ( 90387 ). more Sickle cell disease. Oral vitamin B12 has only been evaluated in combination with other B vitamins; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in adults with sickle cell disease shows that taking vitamin B12 4.2-6 mcg, folic acid 700 mcg, and vitamin B6 4.2-6 mg daily might lower homocysteine levels. However, it is unknown if this will reduce the risk of endothelial damage in these patients ( 9324 ). more Stroke. It is unclear if oral vitamin B12, either alone or with other B vitamins, is beneficial for stroke prevention. Epidemiological research has found that people with a higher intake of vitamin B12 from dietary sources do not have a reduced risk of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke ( 14316 ). A number of clinical studies and meta-analyses show that supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, alone or in combination, does not reduce the risk of stroke in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or impaired kidney function ( 11387 , 13482 , 50420 , 50423 , 83050 , 90379 , 90380 , 96150 ). However, a more recent meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials including over 44,000 patients shows that B vitamin supplementation modestly reduces the relative risk of stroke by 10% when compared with placebo in patients at risk or with a history of CVD ( 97619 ). This meta-analysis differed from some of the earlier analyses due to the inclusion of several additional clinical trials. Also, a meta-analysis in adults with a history of stroke shows that B vitamin supplementation modestly reduces the relative risk of stroke recurrence by 13% and vascular death by 11% when compared with placebo ( 107136 ). In 2001, prior to the publication of the highest quality research on this topic, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed a qualified health claim stating that, as part of a well-balanced diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol, folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 may reduce the risk of vascular disease ( 102368 ). Unfortunately, even after the publication of higher quality research, it is still unclear which specific combination of B vitamins is optimal and which patients are most likely to benefit. One network meta-analysis suggests that a combination of folic acid and vitamin B6 lowers the risk of stroke more effectively than B vitamin mixtures that include vitamin B12 ( 96165 ). However, this analysis is limited because it didn't account for dosing. Another meta-analysis suggests that exposure to low, but not high, amounts of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) seems to reduce stroke risk ( 96150 ). more Tinnitus. It is unclear if intramuscular vitamin B12 is beneficial in patients with tinnitus. A small clinical study shows that intramuscular vitamin B12 2500 mcg weekly for 6 weeks reduces tinnitus severity by 22% when compared to baseline in patients with chronic tinnitus and vitamin B12 deficiency, but not in patients with normal levels of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 does not improve pitch or volume in either group of patients ( 96170 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. more Venous thromboembolism (VTE). It is unclear if oral vitamin B12 is beneficial for preventing VTE. Epidemiological research has found that low levels of vitamin B12 are associated with an increased risk for VTE. However, clinical trials evaluating the use of B vitamins for prevention of VTE have shown conflicting results ( 90398 ). more More evidence is needed to rate vitamin B12 for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally, topically, intravenously, intramuscularly, or intranasally and appropriately. Vitamin B12 is generally considered safe, even in large doses ( 15 , 1344 , 1345 , 1346 , 1347 , 1348 , 2909 , 6243 , 7289 , 7881 )( 9414 , 9416 , 10126 , 14392 , 15765 , 82832 , 82949 , 82860 , 82864 , 90386 )( 111334 , 111551 ). PREGNANCY: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). The RDA for vitamin B12 during pregnancy is 2.6 mcg daily ( 6243 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of larger amounts of vitamin B12 during pregnancy. LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the recommended dietary allowance (RDA). The RDA of vitamin B12 during lactation is 2.8 mcg daily ( 6243 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of larger amounts of vitamin B12 while breastfeeding.</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: General : The daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) of vitamin B12 are: 18 years and older, 2.4 mcg; pregnancy, 2.6 mcg; lactation, 2.8 mcg. Since 10% to 30% of older adults do not absorb food-bound vitamin B12 efficiently, those over 50 years of age are advised to meet the RDA by eating foods fortified with vitamin B12 or by taking a vitamin B12 supplement. 25-100 mcg daily has been taken to maintain vitamin B12 levels in older people. A healthcare professional should be consulted for use for other indications ( 6243 ). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Excessive alcohol intake lasting longer than two weeks can decrease vitamin B12 absorption from the gastrointestinal tract ( 15 ). All other ROAs:Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Children Oral: General : The daily recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) have not been established for all pediatric age groups; therefore, adequate intake (AI) levels have been used instead. The RDAs or AI levels of vitamin B12 by age are: 0-6 months, 0.4 mcg (AI); 7-12 months, 0.5 mcg (AI); 1-3 years, 0.9 mcg; 4-8 years, 1.2 mcg; 9-13 years, 1.8 mcg ( 6243 ). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization &amp; Formulation The term "vitamin B12" refers to any of the cobalamins, a group of chemically-related molecules that all have a cobalt-containing center. Methylcobalamin is the active form of vitamin B12 in the human body, but it is rarely used in supplements because it is light sensitive ( 90948 ). Cyanocobalamin is the most common form of vitamin B12 used in supplements in the United States ( 74154 ). This form of vitamin B12 must be metabolized before becoming active ( 90948 ). In one branded product (Eligen B12), cyanocobalamin has been formulated with salcaprozate sodium (SNAC) to increase oral absorption ( 103973 ). Hydroxocobalamin is another form of vitamin B12 that is commonly used in some parts of Europe ( 90948 ). When administered intramuscularly, hydroxocobalamin is retained in the body for longer than cyanocobalamin ( 90949 ).</data><data key="mechanism_text">General Vitamin B12 is an essential water-soluble vitamin that is commonly found in a variety of foods, such as fish, shellfish, meat, eggs, and dairy products ( 74154 ). The term vitamin B12 refers to all cobalamins that are active as coenzymes in humans, including dibencozide (adenosylcobalamin), methylcobalamin, and hydroxocobalamin ( 5133 ). Vitamin B12 is required for nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis, cell reproduction, normal growth, and normal erythropoiesis. The synthetic forms of vitamin B12, cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin, can be converted to coenzyme B12, which is essential for the conversion of methylmalonate to succinate, and the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine ( 15 , 9320 ). Vitamin B12 is involved in maintaining sulfhydryl groups in the reduced form required by enzymes involved in fat and carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis. Vitamin B12 is essential for folate utilization, and its absence results in a functional folate deficiency ( 15 ). Vitamin B12 deficiency can take months to years to become symptomatic due to large body stores. Normal serum vitamin B12 levels range between 200-900 pg/mL. Serum concentrations less than 200 pg/mL indicate deficiency, and concentrations less than 100 pg/mL usually result in megaloblastic anemia or neurologic damage ( 15 ). Vitamin B12 deficiency results in megaloblastic anemia, gastrointestinal lesions, and neurologic damage, beginning with an inability to produce myelin and progressing to degeneration of the axon and nerve head ( 15 ). Neurologic symptoms caused by vitamin B12 deficiency can include neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression ( 6357 ), paresthesias, ataxia, memory loss, weakness, and personality and mood changes without anemia ( 1484 , 1485 , 3235 , 5646 ). Some neurologic symptoms and elevated homocysteine levels can occur without any signs of B12 deficiency anemia ( 1484 , 1485 , 3235 ). Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with impaired cognitive performance in adolescents (aged 10-16 years) who have been fed a strict vegetarian diet from infancy to 6 years of age. Consequences of low vitamin B12 intake during childhood and its effect on cognitive functioning in adulthood are unknown ( 10125 ). Elevated methylmalonate or methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels occur early in vitamin B12 deficiency, and may precede other symptoms ( 1484 , 1485 , 5646 ). In combination with homocysteine levels, MMA levels can be used to diagnose vitamin B12 deficiency ( 5646 ). The risk for vitamin B12 deficiency is higher with increased age, male gender, and in people of Caucasian and Latin American descent. Deficiency in vitamin B12 results from insufficient intake, malabsorption from food, and other medical conditions ( 1484 , 1485 ). However, body stores of vitamin B12 are large, and it is widely available in food. Vitamin B12 deficiency is almost always caused by a disorder of absorption ( 9518 ). Deficiency of vitamin B12 can be masked by folic acid, particularly in large doses. Folate will improve vitamin B12 associated anemia, but it will allow the neurologic abnormalities to progress. There is some concern that food fortified with folic acid can cause under-recognition of vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in the elderly ( 5646 ). Anticancer effects Vitamin B12 is believed to possess anticancer properties ( 82890 ), and supplementation of vitamin B12 may have a role in preventing cervical cancer ( 50130 , 34609 ). However, although some epidemiological research disagrees ( 9454 ), most research has found that elevated plasma levels of vitamin B12 are associated with an increased risk of various types of cancer, including lung and prostate cancers and solid tumors ( 50411 , 102383 , 107743 ). It is unclear if increased intake of vitamin B12, either through the diet or supplementation, directly affects the risk of cancer. It is possible that having cancer increases the risk of vitamin B12 elevation. However, one observational study has found that the highest quintile of dietary intake of vitamin B12 is associated with a 75% increased incidence of developing esophageal cancer when compared with the lowest quintile in never drinkers, but not drinkers ( 107147 ). Also, human research suggests that elevated serum vitamin B12 levels associated with tumor markers may indicate poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients ( 82887 ). Cardiovascular effects Vitamin B12 is required in one of the pathways for homocysteine metabolism. Remethylation of homocysteine to methionine requires folate and the methylcobalamin form of vitamin B12 as a cofactor ( 9407 , 9409 ). Some evidence suggests elevated homocysteine levels might cause vascular endothelial cell damage, impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation due to reduced nitric oxide activity, increased oxidation and arterial deposition of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), increased platelet adhesiveness, and activation of the clotting cascade ( 2147 , 9403 , 9408 ). Vitamin B12 supplements have a small additive effect to folic acid in lowering fasting homocysteine levels, but probably only in people with vitamin B12 deficiency ( 2147 , 50314 , 50222 , 50014 , 50164 ). Elevated homocysteine concentrations are possibly associated with other conditions such as developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), decreased cognitive function, impaired memory, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia ( 5646 , 9330 , 9331 ). Hepatic effects In vitro research shows that vitamin B12 inhibits hepatitis C virus replication. Additionally, some liver diseases appear to be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency secondary to impaired storage of vitamin B12 in the liver. Theoretically, supplementation with vitamin B12 may restore liver stores of vitamin B12 and improve virological response in patients with hepatitis. This has been demonstrated in preliminary clinical research ( 90386 ). Neurological effects Low vitamin B12 levels are possibly associated with chronic fatigue syndrome ( 6082 ). Some researchers think that vitamin B12 supplements could help symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome by correcting red blood cell abnormalities and improving oxygen delivery to tissues ( 6082 ). The methylcobalamin form of vitamin B12 might also influence melatonin levels. Methylcobalamin seems to improve alertness and reduce sleep time in humans with normal sleep patterns, possibly due to effects on melatonin ( 1349 ). Preliminary clinical research in elderly patients shows that taking B vitamins, including vitamin B12, reduces brain atrophy in the areas of the brain most affected by Alzheimer disease. This suggests that taking vitamin B12 along with other B vitamins might prevent or delay the progression to Alzheimer disease in some patients ( 90374 ). Additional evidence suggests that supplementation of B vitamins, including vitamin B12, may help prevent dementia by lowering homocysteine levels ( 50222 , 50277 ). Some research shows that elevated serum homocysteine and low folate and vitamin B12 levels may be associated with poor cognitive function, cognitive decline, and dementia ( 82884 ). Otic effects Low vitamin B12 levels have been associated with hearing loss in elderly women ( 1482 ). Voice effects A small study in active adult singers shows that receiving an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) 1 mg tends to improve ease of singing and voice handicap, and reduce fatigue 3 days after the shot. However, the benefit did not reach statistical nor clinical significance when compared with baseline or placebo ( 104925 ).</data><data key="name">Vitamin B12</data><data key="scientific_name">Adenosylcobalamin, Cyanocobalamin, Hydroxocobalamin, Methylcobalamin, Vitamin B12</data><data key="overview_text">Vitamin B12 is an essential water-soluble vitamin that is commonly found in a variety of foods, such as fish, shellfish, meat, eggs, and dairy products. It is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex formulations. Methylcobalamin is the active form of vitamin B12. Cyanocobalamin, which must be metabolized to the active form, is the most common form used in supplements. Reportedly, vitamin B12 was discovered by George Whipple while trying to find a cure for pernicious anemia.</data></node>

The term vitamin D refers to several forms of vitamin D. There are 2 forms that are physiologically important, ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Ergocalciferol comes from ergosterol, a plant sterol, and yeast. Cholecalciferol is synthesized in the skin via 7-dehydrocholesterol, a cholesterol precursor. Both ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol are biologically inert and require hydroxylation in the body to form the active metabolite, calcitriol ( 7555 , 16890 ). Since the early 1900s, ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol have been considered to be equally potent and effective in humans. However, more recently, research shows that cholecalciferol is significantly more potent than ergocalciferol and is more effective at improving total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels ( 11937 , 11938 , 15263 , 15264 , 16119 , 107228 ). Ergocalciferol appears to be less than one-third the potency of cholecalciferol ( 11937 , 11938 , 15263 , 15264 , 16119 ). A blood concentration of 20 ng/mL 25-hydroxyvitamin D is considered the level to meet the bodily needs of 97.5% of the population. Lower amounts are usually considered a 'deficiency'. Higher concentrations of 32 ng/mL are preferred ( 15638 , 93945 ). Most laboratories consider the "normal" range to be 20 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL ( 16119 ). Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. Dietary sources include eggs from hens that have been fed vitamin D and fatty fish such as herrings, mackerel, sardines, and tuna. In the US, Canada, and many other countries, the main source of dietary vitamin D is fortified milk and other foods. However, these are relatively minor sources of vitamin D ( 7555 ). Brief exposure to sunlight (about 25% of the amount of time it would take to cause light pinkness to the skin) is the most efficient way to get vitamin D ( 11935 ). Skin exposure to the sun provides as much as 80% to 90% of the body's vitamin D stores ( 7133 ). Full-body sun exposure can lead to the synthesis of as much as 10,000 units of vitamin D daily ( 6855 ). Vitamin D is stored in body fat for use during periods without sun exposure. Sun exposure is an easy, reliable way for most patients to get vitamin D. Exposure of the hands, face, arms, and legs to sunlight two to three times a week for the amount of time equal to about 25% of what it would take to develop a mild sunburn will cause the skin to produce adequate vitamin D. Exposure time will vary with skin type, season, and time of day ( 12992 ). Conversely, excessive sun exposure causes photodegradation of vitamin D produced in the skin, limiting the risk of vitamin D toxicity from such exposure ( 11936 ). Vitamin D insufficiency, based on blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D below 20 ng/mL, is common in the northern latitudes such as Canada and the northern half of the US ( 12995 ). Interestingly, these levels also occur in as many as 40% of older people even in sunny climates such as South Florida ( 15637 ). Prevalence of vitamin D considered insufficient and deficient among young, healthy people appears to be increasing, possibly because of excessive use of sunscreens ( 12995 ). Exposure to sunlight might not always be sufficient to cause vitamin D synthesis in the skin. Sunlight intensity is dependent on latitude, altitude, season, cloud cover, ozone levels and other factors. During winter in some northern latitudes (e.g., northern US and Canada), little, if any, vitamin D3 is produced in the skin. For example, in Boston there is insufficient UV-B energy for vitamin D production in the skin for 4 months of the year. In Edmonton, the skin can't produce vitamin D for 5 months of the year ( 12998 , 12999 , 13000 ). Underway submariners, who get no sunlight for extended periods of time, have lowered 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and evidence of bone resorption and turnover, even when supplemented with 400 IU daily of cholecalciferol. The capacity of UV-B mediated vitamin D synthesis is huge. Just 6 days of casual sunlight exposure without sunscreen can make up for 49 days of no sunlight exposure ( 12998 ). Skin pigmentation affects vitamin D synthesis and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. A light-skinned person in a bathing suit who is not tanned would receive about 10,000 to 20,000 IU of cholecalciferol from 10-12 minutes of peak July summer sun in Boston. For a darker-skinned person, such as Asian Indian, getting this dose of vitamin D could take perhaps 30 minutes of exposure, and, for a very darkly pigmented African American, it could require 120 minutes of exposure ( 12997 ). The skin pigment melanin competes with vitamin D precursors in the skin for photons from UV-B light ( 6857 ). When serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are adjusted for percent body fat, White females have serum levels 1.3-1.9 times higher than Black females ( 16887 ). This also affects vitamin D in breast milk. For example, breast milk from Black females is generally lower in vitamin D content than that from White females (35 units/L compared with 68 units/L, respectively) ( 6857 ). Black infants who are exclusively breast-fed are therefore at risk for vitamin D deficiency and rickets, even if they live in sunny climates such as the southern US ( 6857 ). Vitamin D supplements may be needed by elderly people with limited sun exposure, people living in northern latitudes, dark-skinned people, Asian Indians living in the western hemisphere, as well as people with gastrointestinal diseases leading to malabsorption of vitamin D from the diet ( 6855 , 7133 ). Vitamin D deficiency, based on blood levels &lt;20 ng/mL, is particularly common in adults over age 50 years. More than 50% of North American females receiving therapy to prevent or treat osteoporosis have inadequate vitamin D stores ( 12996 ). Factors such as lack of exposure to sunlight, reduced skin synthesis of vitamin D, lower dietary intake, impaired intestinal absorption, chronic kidney disease, and reduced metabolism to active forms of vitamin D by the kidneys increase with aging ( 11919 , 16883 ). Also, vitamin D receptors seem to decrease with age ( 11921 ). The risk for vitamin D deficiency in elderly adults (&gt;65 years) is very high ( 12995 , 12996 ). The risk for severe vitamin D deficiency is even greater with advanced age. A survey of 104 adults older than 98 years old found blood levels of vitamin D were detectable in only 5 adults. This correlates to a blood level of less than 2 ng/mL ( 16874 ). Body mass index seems to affect vitamin D status. There is some evidence that individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of &gt;25kg/m2 have reduced serum vitamin D levels and/or reduced bioavailability of vitamin D from both cutaneous synthesis and gastrointestinal absorption ( 6856 , 110817 ). In response to similar UV-B exposures, the increase in serum vitamin D levels can be 57% less in people with obesity than in those with lower BMIs ( 6856 ). In individuals with a BMI of at least 25 kg/m2, taking cholecalciferol 2000 IU for 5 years modestly reduces the response to supplementation when compared with individuals with a BMI of up to 25 kg/m2 ( 110817 ). The content of vitamin D precursors in the skin are similar in both groups, suggesting that vitamin D synthesis is not affected by BMI, but that vitamin D is possibly sequestered into body fat, reducing its availability ( 6856 ). The main function of vitamin D is to regulate serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations. Vitamin D enhances the efficiency of the intestinal absorption of calcium, primarily in the duodenum and jejunum, and phosphorus, particularly in the jejunum and ilium ( 7555 ). In the absence of adequate vitamin D, only 10% to 15% of calcium is absorbed and phosphorus absorption is only 60%. In the presence of vitamin D, calcium absorption increases to 30% to 40% and phosphorus absorption to 80% ( 16890 ). Vitamin D can increase serum calcium levels, but this effect is modest in healthy people in doses less than 1200 IU daily. If dietary intake of calcium is inadequate, calcitriol in combination with parathyroid hormone mobilizes calcium stores from bone. Calcitriol also appears to have effects in the brain, heart, pancreas, mononuclear cells, activated lymphocytes, and skin, but its exact physiologic role is unclear ( 7555 ). The hydroxylation of vitamin D to calcitriol occurs in the kidneys. People with chronic renal failure may require forms of vitamin D such as calcitriol, dihydrotachysterol, or calcifediol that don't require renal hydroxylation ( 7555 ). In people with granulomatous disorders such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and histoplasmosis, vitamin D metabolism is disturbed. Vitamin D is converted to calcitriol by activated macrophages trapped in the pulmonary alveoli and granulomatous inflammation, in addition to the kidneys. This may increase the risk of hypercalcemia ( 7555 , 11881 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Although some individual clinical trials disagree ( 110812 , 110828 ), an overarching meta-analysis of 23 individual meta-analyses shows that vitamin D supplementation in adults reduces serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and malondialdehyde. However, there were no effects on levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) or total antioxidant capacity ( 109731 ). Meta-analyses of clinical studies in postmenopausal adults, as well as adults with type 2 diabetes or COVID-19, shows that taking vitamin D reduces CRP levels when compared with control ( 113583 , 115575 , 115581 ). Clinical research in adults with ulcerative colitis, allergic rhinitis, or chronic urticaria shows that vitamin D modestly reduces levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, CRP, and IL-6 and increases levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interferon gamma and IL-10 ( 109044 , 112483 , 11587 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with asthma also shows that taking vitamin D increases levels of IL-10 ( 114505 ). It is unclear whether these benefits are sustained in long-term studies. One large clinical trial shows that taking cholecalciferol alone or with omega-3 fatty acids reduces serum levels of CRP by 19% after 2 years, with no continued evidence of benefit after 4 years. Also, the levels of other inflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators were not affected ( 110815 ). Vitamin D supplementation has also been found to reduce tissue and salivary levels of interferon-gamma ( 114586 ). Anti-malarial effects A meta-analysis of animal research suggests that vitamin D improves survival after Plasmodium infection. Researchers theorize that the benefits of vitamin D in animal models of malaria relate to its anti-inflammatory and immunologic effects ( 112023 ). Anti-oxidant effects There is interest in vitamin D for its potential anti-oxidant effects. Clinical research in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) shows that vitamin D supplementation increases total antioxidant capacity and reduces malondialdehyde when compared with a control ( 114584 ). Anti-sepsis effects There is interest in using vitamin D to improve outcomes in patients with sepsis. A meta-analysis of case-control studies shows that neonates and children with sepsis are more likely to have low serum levels of vitamin D than non-septic patients. However, a meta-analysis of cohort studies suggests that children with low serum vitamin D levels (&lt; 20 ng/mL) do not have an increased risk of sepsis, mechanical ventilation, or mortality. This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups ( 105722 ). It is unknown if treating low serum levels of vitamin D will prevent sepsis or improve outcomes in patients with sepsis. Antidiabetic effects There is interest in whether supplementing with vitamin D can impact glycemic indices in diabetes. Vitamin D impacts the function of beta-cells by mediating calcium flux. Population research found that a lower vitamin D level is associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to higher vitamin D levels ( 15630 , 16713 , 84594 ). Some preliminary clinical research suggests that vitamin D insufficiency may contribute to impairment of insulin secretion and insulin action ( 83898 ). Other clinical research in patients mostly without diabetes shows that supplementing with calcium 1000 mg or more daily in conjunction with vitamin D 2000 IU or more daily lowers fasting blood glucose and reduces insulin levels and insulin resistance measured by Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) ( 100893 ). However, it doesn't seem that vitamin D supplements can prevent or treat diabetes. Most evidence suggests that vitamin D does not significantly improve glycemic indices in patients with type 2 diabetes with adequate vitamin D status, but it may help prevent the development of type 1 diabetes when given to infants during early childhood ( 10139 , 83898 , 84225 , 84488 , 84594 , 84636 , 84645 , 84808 , 91347 , 96403 )( 107210 , 110822 ). Although supplementation with oral vitamin D, alone or in combination with omega-3 fatty acids, for 8 weeks actually seems to increase glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels by about 0.2% or 0.4%, respectively, in patients who are vitamin D-deficient and mostly healthy when compared with control, it should be noted that more patients receiving supplementation had prediabetes at baseline when compared with control ( 107192 ). Bone effects Since vitamin D is important for calcium homeostasis and for bone health, it is used to help prevent osteoporosis. Early research suggested serum levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (calcifediol) of at least 16 ng/mL for optimal bone health ( 6854 ). This is supported by the dietary reference intakes ( 93945 ). However, some researchers suggest serum levels of 28 to 32 ng/mL may be necessary for bone health ( 13276 ). When intake of calcium is low in healthy elderly females, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (calcifediol) seems to be more biologically active and a more important determinant of gut calcium absorption than calcitriol ( 10141 ). Osteopenia in elderly males also seems to correlate with circulating levels of vitamin D and vitamin K ( 7132 ). There is also concern that high dose vitamin D might result in lower bone mineral density (BMD); however, research has not shown consistent results. Clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking vitamin D for 3 years at a dose of 4000 IU daily or 10000 IU daily seems to result in lower radial BMD when compared with control of taking 400 IU daily. Tibial BMD was lower only with the 10 000 IU dose when compared with control. However, there were no differences between groups in BMD of the radius or tibia ( 100894 ). Cancer effects There is some epidemiological evidence that people with vitamin D deficiency might be at an increased risk of colon, breast, and prostate cancer ( 7555 ). Other evidence suggests that higher serum levels of vitamin D are associated with a decreased risk of cancer ( 16101 ). Some researchers think vitamin D might have antiproliferative effects in these cancers ( 6855 ). Prostate cancer has been associated with decreased sun exposure and vitamin D receptor activity ( 12994 ). Some evidence also suggests that vitamin D may play a role in the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis ( 16882 ). Cardiovascular effects There is interest in using vitamin D to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D is thought to play a role in cardiovascular disease by affecting inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukins. Vitamin D might also decrease cardiac and vascular remodeling through suppression of the rennin gene and suppression of parathyroid hormone ( 14614 , 16620 , 16621 , 16622 ). Some research shows that vitamin D supplementation might also suppress macrophage cholesterol uptake and decrease foam cell formation ( 16873 ). Clinical research in adults with heart failure shows that taking vitamin D with calcium reduces serum aldosterone levels, but does not alter serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), or galectin-3 ( 97300 ). There is also interest in whether vitamin D might reduce progression of atherosclerosis. However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that vitamin D supplementation has no effect on measures of endothelial function such as flow-mediated dilation, pulse wave velocity, and central augmentation index ( 103663 , 103664 ). Evidence in humans also suggests that taking vitamin D may result in a reduction in blood pressure. However, not all studies agree. It is possible that blood pressure lowering effects associated with vitamin D are related to direct effects on the vascular cells or a suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( 84226 , 84364 , 84410 , 84554 , 84631 , 84692 ). There is interest in whether a mega-dose of vitamin D can decrease the resting blood pressure in elderly females with hypertension, enhance post-exercise hypotension, and improve autonomic nervous modulation. A small case control study in older females with hypertension shows that taking a single dose of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 200,000 IU does not reduce resting blood pressure, but might reduce post-exercise systolic hypotension, and increase the low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio, a controversial measure of sympathovagal balance ( 103657 ). Gastrointestinal effects There is interest in the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), which involves chronic recurrent inflammation of the colon. A small clinical study in patients with mild-to-moderate UC shows that receiving a single muscular injection of 7.5 mg vitamin D3 decreases serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon-c, and interleukin (IL)-12p70 levels, but not IL-4 and IL-10 levels, when compared with an injection of normal saline ( 100898 ). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with UC shows that taking vitamin D modestly reduces levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and improves the repair function of intestinal mucosa ( 109044 ). Hematologic effects An observational study in patients with vitamin D deficiency has found that supplementation with vitamin D is associated with reduced platelet concentrations ( 107229 ). Hepatoprotective effects There is interest in using vitamin D to treat or prevent hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. However, preliminary clinical research in adults with serum vitamin D levels &lt;30 ng/mL and a sustained virological response after hepatitis C treatment shows that taking vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) 60,000-100,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks does not reduce serum levels of hepatic fibrinogenesis markers, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and amino terminal type III procollagen peptide (P3NP), when compared with placebo. However, this study did not evaluate liver biopsies for fibrosis ( 105723 ). Hormonal effects There is interest in using vitamin D to increase testosterone levels in males and improve the hormone profile in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, a small clinical study in middle-aged males with low testosterone levels shows that taking vitamin D 20,000 IU daily for 12 weeks does not affect levels of serum total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, or luteinizing hormone ( 103660 ). Clinical research in patients with PCOS shows that vitamin D supplementation reduces total testosterone levels but does not modify levels of sex-hormone binding globulin or free androgen index ( 114584 ). Immunologic effects Vitamin D may have immunologic activity. In models of autoimmune disease, vitamin D seems to act as an immunosuppressant. This might explain why increased vitamin D intake is associated with a lower risk of autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) ( 12206 , 84529 , 107184 ). Additionally, people with autoimmune disease seem to have lower serum vitamin D levels than healthy controls ( 112482 , 112483 ). Some evidence suggests vitamin D supplementation during infancy might prevent the development of type 1 diabetes later on in life. Type 1 diabetes is believed to be an autoimmune disease. Vitamin D supplementation might inhibit an autoimmune reaction that targets the beta cells of the pancreas ( 10139 , 16886 ). Vitamin D has also shown other immunologic effects. Some research shows that CD4+ T cell counts are lower in patients with tuberculosis and low vitamin D status when compared with those with normal vitamin D status, and that supplementation with vitamin D as calcitriol increases these T cell counts ( 109045 ). Another study in patients with allergic rhinitis suggests that vitamin D reduces CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ ratio and increases CD8+ serum levels ( 112483 ). In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, taking vitamin D increases neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, decreases levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and alters the activity of B cells ( 109047 ). Neurologic effects A small meta-analysis of clinical studies in a mixed population shows that taking vitamin D improves sleep quality by 2 points on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) when compared with control ( 108433 ). Respiratory effects There is interest in using vitamin D for improving respiratory disorders such as bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and asthma. Epidemiological evidence suggests that 25-hydroxy vitamin D serum levels are associated with pulmonary function. People with higher levels seem to have greater pulmonary function as measured by FEV1 compared to people with lower levels. It is theorized that vitamin D might be involved in remodeling of lung tissue ( 14252 , 17685 ). Vitamin D might also improve lung function by decreasing immune-mediated inflammation in the airway ( 14253 , 84505 , 84613 ). Evidence from a population based study suggests patients with low 25-hydroxy vitamin D serum levels are 27% to 55% more likely to have upper respiratory tract infections compared to patients with normal levels ( 16830 ), though clinical research has not shown that vitamin D supplementation reduces the incidence of acute respiratory infections in older adults ( 114506 ). It is also not known if taking vitamin D supplements improves pulmonary function. Vitamin D deficiency has been commonly reported in children with mild-to-moderate asthma and is also associated with increased risk of asthma exacerbations that are severe. Vitamin D receptor variants have been associated with asthma in some population studies. Additionally, population studies suggest that lower vitamin D levels are correlated with increased inhaled corticosteroid needs in children ( 17685 ). Skeletal muscle effects Vitamin D deficiency causes muscle pain and proximal muscle weakness with symptoms such as sensation of heaviness in the legs, rapid fatigue, and problems with climbing stairs and getting up from a chair. Some preliminary clinical research suggests that people with low vitamin D levels, considered to be less than or equal to 20 ng/mL, have more osteoarthritis pain and disability than people with adequate vitamin D stores. Vitamin D deficiency also increases postural sway and affects psychomotor function ( 11922 , 11923 , 11924 , 11925 , 12491 ). Vitamin D may prevent falls by increasing muscle strength and neuromuscular function in addition to strengthening bone. It seems to increase muscle protein synthesis, possibly by activating second messengers and phosphorylation ( 11919 , 11922 ). Some evidence also shows that higher serum levels of vitamin D is associated with improved lower-extremity function in people aged 60 years or older ( 15636 ). The standard dose of 400 units that is found in most multivitamin tablets appears to be too low to prevent falls or reduce fracture risk, but the optimal dose is unknown ( 11926 , 11927 , 11928 ). Fractures were reduced in clinical trials using 700 to 800 units of vitamin D daily ( 11930 , 11931 ). Some research suggests that sufficient calcium intake along with vitamin D is necessary to prevent falls ( 11932 ). Thyroid effects A meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis shows that vitamin D supplementation reduces thyroid peroxidase antibody titers, especially when cholecalciferol is used for more than 3 months ( 108430 ). Uterine effects Vitamin D regulates cytochrome P450-27B1 and -24A1 enzymes, which are dysregulated in uterine fibroid disease. It also decreases growth of uterine fibroid cells, reducing expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and cell proliferation nuclear antigen ( 113577 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Likely Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Vitamin%20D</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Effective Familial hypophosphatemia. Oral vitamin D in combination with phosphate is effective for bone disorders in patients with familial hypophosphatemia. Taking calcitriol or dihydrotachysterol orally in combination with phosphate supplements is effective for treating bone disorders in people with familial hypophosphatemia ( 11818 ). more Hypoparathyroidism. Oral vitamin D increases serum calcium concentrations in people with hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is effective in high doses for increasing serum calcium concentrations in people with hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism ( 11820 ). Also, taking vitamin D (form unspecified) or calcitriol postoperatively is effective for preventing hypocalcemia in people with hypoparathyroidism due to thyroidectomy ( 39045 ). more Osteomalacia. Oral vitamin D is effective for osteomalacia. Oral calcifediol is effective for treating osteomalacia secondary to liver disease (hepatic osteodystrophy) and anticonvulsant-induced osteomalacia. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is effective for osteomalacia due to malabsorption syndromes, Fanconi syndrome, and corticosteroid-induced osteomalacia ( 11819 , 11821 ). more Renal osteodystrophy. Oral calcitriol prevents renal osteodystrophy in patients with chronic renal failure. Taking calcitriol orally manages hypocalcemia and prevents renal osteodystrophy in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis ( 11823 ). more Rickets. Oral vitamin D prevents and treats rickets. Vitamin D is effective for preventing and treating rickets, a consequence of vitamin D deficiency. Calcitriol should be used in patients with renal failure ( 11824 ). Clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, based on low certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from vitamin D fortified foods, vitamin D supplements, or vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D to prevent nutritional rickets in children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years. Empiric vitamin D supplementation is defined as supplementing with vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status ( 114502 ). A large clinical study in pregnant adults shows that taking vitamin D 28,000 IU weekly from the second trimester up to 6 months post-partum decreases the risk of biochemical rickets by about 84% in the offspring at 6-12 months of age when compared with placebo. However, taking vitamin D 4200, 16,800, or 28,000 IU weekly from the second trimester to delivery does not decrease the risk of rickets in the offspring when compared with placebo ( 114503 ). more Vitamin D deficiency. Oral vitamin D prevents and treats vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is effective for preventing and treating vitamin D deficiency using a wide range of doses and dosing frequencies ( 7555 , 16888 , 16891 , 17476 , 115590 ). Optimal blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D for maintaining bone density is controversial; however, it is typically estimated that blood levels of 20-100 ng/mL are needed. Toxicity usually does not occur until levels exceed 150 ng/mL ( 17476 , 93945 ). Vitamin D also alleviates symptoms and syndromes associated with vitamin D deficiency. Administering vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) intramuscularly or orally seems to help treat severe proximal myopathy associated with severe vitamin D deficiency. Several case reports suggest vitamin D therapy can provide prompt relief of muscle weakness and restore mobility ( 11923 , 84348 , 84687 ). more Likely Effective Corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. Oral vitamin D prevents corticosteroid-induced osteopenia and osteoporosis. Taking calcifediol, cholecalciferol, calcitriol, or alfacalcidol orally prevents corticosteroid-induced osteopenia and osteoporosis ( 7555 , 83933 ). Vitamin D3 metabolites, including calcitriol and alfacalcidol, seem to be more effective at preventing bone loss compared to cholecalciferol in these patients, although the vitamin D3 metabolites seem to be inferior to bisphosphonates ( 83955 ). Furthermore, taking activated vitamin D or other forms of vitamin D alone or along with calcium improves bone mineral density in people with corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis ( 38493 , 38581 ). more Osteoporosis. Adequate intake of vitamin D in conjunction with adequate calcium intake helps to prevent the progression of osteoporosis. It might also reduce the risk of a first fracture in some patients. However, its place in the prevention of secondary fracture is unclear. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation (BHOF) recommends ensuring adequate vitamin D intake of 800-1000 IU daily along with adequate calcium intake for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in adults over 50 years of age. Supplementation can be used to augment dietary intake, with a target serum vitamin D level of 30 ng/mL ( 109425 ). In the US, foods that contain at least 120 IU vitamin D can be labelled with a health claim regarding the relationship between adequate vitamin D intake and a reduced risk for osteoporosis ( 97001 ). However, vitamin D supplementation is not recommended specifically for the primary prevention of osteoporosis. The US Preventive Task Force (USPSTF) states that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, alone or in combination, for the primary prevention of fractures in community dwelling adults without osteoporosis ( 95695 ). Clinical research shows that vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and calcium can decrease postmenopausal bone loss, improve bone density, help prevent osteoporosis, and decrease the risk of fractures ( 10932 , 12926 , 12930 , 12934 , 12952 ) ( 38973 , 39015 , 39026 , 84003 , 113584 ). According to one analysis, taking oral vitamin D3 700-800 IU daily with or without calcium reduces fracture risk in ambulatory and institutionalized elderly people ( 12933 ). Other analyses suggest that taking vitamin D as cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, calcifediol, calcitriol, or alfacalcidol with or without calcium can reduce the risk of all fractures by up to 17%, nonvertebral fractures by up to 49%, and hip fractures by up to 30% in older adults. However, the incidence of vertebral fractures does not appear to be reduced with vitamin D supplementation ( 38942 , 38970 , 38973 , 39015 , 39026 , 84660 , 109053 ). Despite the majority of research showing benefit, some studies have not found a positive effect of vitamin D on fracture risk. Some analyses of clinical evidence, including patients with and without osteoporosis, show that taking vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) alone does not reduce fracture risk, suggesting that adequate calcium intake is needed for any benefit to be realized ( 39015 , 84471 ). Also, some evidence suggests that vitamin D3 400 IU daily is not effective for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in elderly nursing home residents ( 109053 ). Another clinical trial found that taking vitamin D3 800 IU daily with calcium 1200-1500 mg daily for 2 years does not increase bone mineral density (BMD) in Black postmenopausal adults. This may be due to the fact that Black females have a lower rate of bone remodeling, an increased calcium absorption efficiency, and reduced calcium excretion when compared with other ethnic groups; therefore, supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium might not be as beneficial in these patients ( 16878 ). There is concern that vitamin D might not be effective for secondary prevention of fractures in elderly patients. A meta-analysis of clinical studies, including many studies cited above, and a large clinical study in elderly adults with a previous osteoporotic fracture show that taking vitamin D3 400-4000 IU daily or as a single dose up to 500,000 IU orally or injected annually with or without calcium 480-1200 mg daily for up to 5 years does not reduce the risk of hip, vertebral, or other fractures when compared with placebo or no treatment ( 13073 , 112486 ). Another study also shows that taking vitamin D3 800 IU and calcium 1000 mg daily does not prevent a second fracture in elderly patients, or prevent a first fracture in elderly patients with other risk factors such as low body weight (under 58 kg, 127.6 pounds), smoking, family history of hip fracture, or fair or poor self-reported health ( 12929 ). However, these studies have been criticized for failing to measure vitamin D levels and low adherence to study protocol ( 12931 ). Also, one of these studies did not use a placebo control ( 12929 ). Taking alfacalcidol orally seems to maintain BMD in prostatic carcinoma patients at risk for osteoporosis when treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue (LHRH-a). Alfacalcidol maintains, but does not increase, BMD in these patients ( 6360 ). more Psoriasis. Topical vitamin D or vitamin D analogues improve symptoms of psoriasis. This benefit is not seen with oral vitamin D. Topical application of vitamin D in the form of calcitriol or other vitamin D analogues, such as calcipotriene, maxacalcitol, and paricalcitol, effectively treats plaque psoriasis in some patients, including those with chronic plaque psoriasis ( 11822 , 84325 ). Applying topical vitamin D or its analogues in combination with topical corticosteroids such as betamethasone seems to be more effective for treating plaque psoriasis than either agent used alone ( 22283 , 82572 , 84325 , 84536 , 84647 ). Despite evidence that patients with psoriasis have low baseline serum levels of vitamin D, taking oral vitamin D does not seem to prevent psoriasis, improve symptoms, or reduce the severity of psoriasis in general ( 11822 , 22283 , 82572 , 84325 , 84536 , 84647 , 98193 , 108426 , 112481 , 112482 ). An analysis of a large clinical study in older adults with mild psoriasis shows that taking a vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) loading dose of 200,000 IU followed by vitamin D3 100,000 IU monthly for 1 year does not affect the severity or spread of psoriasis when compared with placebo ( 98193 ). more Possibly Effective Allergic rhinitis (hay fever). Some research suggests that oral vitamin D reduces symptoms of allergic rhinitis in children and adults. It is unclear if oral vitamin D during pregnancy is beneficial for the prevention of allergic rhinitis in the child. Preliminary clinical research in adults with allergic rhinitis and vitamin D deficiency shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks along with cetirizine improves overall symptom severity when compared with placebo and cetirizine. This improvement was not significant at 4 weeks, suggesting that symptom improvement might not occur until vitamin D has been adequately replenished ( 102120 ). Another moderate-sized clinical study conducted in China in adults with moderate to severe allergic rhinitis and vitamin D levels at the low end of the normal range shows that taking vitamin D 800 IU daily for 4 weeks along with mometasone nasal spray improves runny nose, itchy nose, and nasal congestion but does not reduce sneezing when compared with placebo and mometasone ( 112483 ). In children aged 5-15 years, 4 small- or moderate-sized clinical trials show that taking vitamin D 800 IU or 1000 IU daily for 1-6 months modestly reduces symptoms such as nasal congestion and rhinorrhea when compared with placebo or no supplementation ( 109728 ). It is unclear whether these children had vitamin D deficiency at baseline. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy has also been evaluated. A meta-analysis of three large clinical studies shows that prenatal vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the risk of the child developing allergic rhinitis when compared with low-dose vitamin D, placebo, or no intervention ( 108438 ). more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Clinical research suggests that vitamin D deficiency is associated with greater risk for and severity of COVID-19 infection. Research of varying quality has evaluated the use of vitamin D supplementation in adults with COVID-19 infection, suggesting that it does not reduce overall mortality, but may reduce the risk of intubation and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). It is unclear whether any benefits are correlated to baseline vitamin D status. Clinical and observational research suggests that prophylactic vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk for and severity of COVID-19 infection in people with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency at baseline. An umbrella review of meta-analyses summarizing data from 9 observational studies suggests that vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk for COVID-19 infection and a greater severity of illness when compared with control ( 114583 ). Additionally, a separate meta-analysis of 12 observational studies conducted early in the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that low baseline vitamin D status (25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 30 ng/mL) is associated with a greater risk of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and mortality when compared with higher levels. However, patients with lower vitamin D levels were also more likely to have baseline hypertension and cardiovascular disease ( 107206 ). While earlier meta-analyses suggested that vitamin D supplementation did not prevent COVID-19 ( 109040 , 112488 ), a larger and more recent meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies conducted in healthcare workers, of whom 85-94% had vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, shows that taking vitamin D reduces the odds of developing a COVID-19 infection by about 80% when compared with control. A separate meta-analysis of 2 clinical studies in the general population found no correlation between vitamin D supplementation and risk of COVID-19 infection; however, the people in these studies had adequate vitamin D levels at baseline ( 113590 ). The benefits of vitamin D prophylaxis in people with sufficient vitamin D levels is unclear. Clinical studies have evaluated the use of vitamin D supplementation in hospitalized adults with COVID-19, assessing hospital length of stay (LOS), the risk of ICU admission, and rate of intubation. Although meta-analyses conducted in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic did not identify an association between vitamin D supplementation and any of these outcomes ( 107206 , 109733 , 112490 ), more recent meta-analyses suggest benefit in certain populations. Meta-analyses of clinical studies in adults with COVID-19 show that vitamin D supplementation may be correlated with a modest reduction in hospital LOS in certain patients when compared with placebo or a lower dose of vitamin D. Subgroup analyses suggest that this reduction may be limited to patients with non-severe disease and those aged 60-65 years and older ( 115575 , 115578 ). Additionally, more recent meta-analyses of clinical studies show that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of admission to the ICU when compared with control, although the odds ratio varies depending on the analysis conducted ( 112488 , 112490 , 115578 ). Similarly, meta-analyses of observational studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation is associated with a reduced odds of ICU admission when compared with control ( 113590 , 115578 ). Also, meta-analyses of clinical studies show that vitamin D supplementation modestly reduces the risk of intubation when compared with control ( 112488 , 115578 ). Meta-analyses of observational studies, as well as studies conducted early in the COVID-19 pandemic, originally suggested a potential reduction in mortality with the use of vitamin D supplementation during hospitalization ( 109040 , 114583 , 115578 ). However, more recent meta-analyses of prospective clinical studies do not support this finding. A meta-analysis of 19 clinical studies in adults with moderate to severe COVID-19 shows that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce mortality when compared with placebo or standard care, when controlling for heterogeneity. Additionally, a subgroup analysis of 13 clinical studies administering high-dose vitamin D does not show a reduction in mortality ( 115576 ). Other meta-analyses of clinical studies also show that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce mortality when compared with control, regardless of baseline vitamin D status ( 114488 , 115578 ). In most studies that provided vitamin D to hospitalized patients, oral doses ranged from 1000-25,000 IU daily for 1-3 weeks, 10,000-25,000 weekly for up to 6 weeks or until hospital discharge, or as a single 140,000-600,000 IU dose. In some studies, vitamin D 200,000-500,000 IU was administered intramuscularly as a single dose. Cholecalciferol was the most common form administered. However, some studies used calcitriol or calcifediol ( 107206 , 107208 , 109040 , 109733 , 112488 , 112490 , 113590 , 114583 , 115575 , 115578 ). Overall, the validity of the findings from meta-analyses is limited by the significant heterogeneity of the included studies, which enrolled patients of varying age, disease severity, and baseline vitamin D status, and implemented highly variable vitamin D supplementation protocols. The relationship between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 has also been evaluated in pregnant adults. A meta-analysis of observational research suggests that, while lower vitamin D levels are not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19, the presence of severe COVID-19 symptoms during pregnancy may be correlated to lower vitamin D levels when compared with non-severe COVID-19 symptoms ( 112025 ). Vitamin D has also been evaluated for post-COVID-19 symptoms. A clinical study in adults with vitamin D deficiency, as well as fatigue and neuropsychiatric symptoms for at least one month post-COVID-19, shows that taking vitamin D 60,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks modestly improves fatigue, anxiety, and some aspects of cognitive function, but not symptoms of depression, when compared with placebo ( 115580 ). It is unclear if the improvements in anxiety and cognitive function were clinically significant. Additionally, it is unclear if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in adults with adequate baseline vitamin D levels. more Dental caries. Some research suggests that oral vitamin D reduces the risk of dental caries in children. A meta-analysis of clinical research suggests that vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) reduces the risk of cavities by 49%, and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) reduces the risk by 36% when compared with placebo in infants, children, and adolescents ( 84690 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the heterogeneity of the included trials. Also, clinical research shows an inverse correlation between cord blood vitamin D status and the number of decayed primary teeth in the infant at 12 months of age ( 104620 ). However, this same research shows that taking two oral prenatal doses of vitamin D2 50,000 IU during pregnancy does not prevent dental caries in the infant at 12 months of age or increase vitamin D levels in the cord blood ( 104620 ). more Heart failure. Limited research suggests that oral vitamin D reduces the risk of developing heart failure in some patients. However, vitamin D does not seem to improve outcomes in patients that have already developed heart failure. Population research has found that vitamin D levels below 15 ng/mL are associated with increased risk of developing heart failure ( 16615 ). A meta-analysis of 17 trials, including the landmark Randomized Evaluation of Calcium Or vitamin D (RECORD) trial, shows that vitamin D reduces the risk of heart failure by 21% compared to not taking vitamin D in patients 60 years or older ( 91343 ). This finding is limited because none of the included trials were designed to determine effects on cardiovascular outcomes. In contrast, a secondary analysis of data from the Women's Health Initiative trial shows that taking vitamin D 400 IU with calcium 1000 mg daily is not associated with a reduced risk of heart failure in postmenopausal adults. However, a subgroup analysis of that trial shows that taking vitamin D plus calcium is associated with a 37% lower risk of developing heart failure in postmenopausal adults classified as low-risk for heart failure at baseline. It is speculated that high-risk patients might not benefit from vitamin D plus calcium due to negative interactions with medications used to manage cardiovascular risk factors in this group ( 97307 ). While vitamin D might be associated with a reduced risk of developing heart failure, most evidence suggests that vitamin D is not beneficial in patients already diagnosed with heart failure. In one small clinical trial, taking vitamin D3 50,000 IU weekly along with calcium citrate 800 mg daily for 6 months was not associated with an improvement in 6-minute walk test, timed get up and go test (TGUG), electrocardiographic variables, or health status when compared with placebo in adults with heart failure; mortality was not evaluated ( 97299 , 97300 ). In another clinical trial, taking vitamin D3 2000 IU daily did not decrease the risk of mortality when compared with placebo in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2 heart failure patients ( 16620 ). more Hyperparathyroidism-related bone loss. Limited evidence suggests that oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with this condition. Taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) orally seems to help decrease secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone turnover in females. In one study, supplementation with vitamin D3 increased serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, reduced levels of parathyroid hormone, and decreased production of markers of bone turnover ( 3463 ). more Respiratory tract infections. Clinical research shows that oral vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children but not in adults or older adults. Some clinical practice guidelines recommend vitamin D supplements or fortified foods for children to potentially lower the risk of RTIs. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the treatment of RTIs. Prenatally, increased levels of vitamin D during pregnancy have been associated with a lower incidence of childhood RTIs ( 98197 ). However, two meta-analyses of small clinical studies and one meta-analysis of large clinical studies show no effect of prenatal vitamin D supplementation on the incidence of infant or childhood RTIs, including lower RTIs, when compared with control. Results related to risk of wheeze are conflicting ( 95910 , 95912 , 108438 ). In children, most research shows that vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of RTIs. A meta-analysis of clinical trials in children aged 1-16 years shows that taking vitamin D decreases the odds of having an RTI by about 29% when compared with control, although this study also identified a high likelihood of publication bias ( 105721 ). Daily or weekly vitamin D doses seem to be more beneficial than single bolus doses, although the largest meta-analysis failed to confirm this result ( 84689 , 93766 , 105721 ). One clinical study in preterm Black infants shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 200 IU daily and then 400 IU daily until 6 months of age does not affect the rate of RTIs, but does reduce wheeze by 11%, when compared with a normal diet without vitamin D supplementation ( 98191 ). This study may not have been powered to detect a difference in RTIs between groups. Clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, based on low certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from vitamin D fortified foods, vitamin D supplements, or vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D to potentially lower the risk of RTIs in children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years. Empiric vitamin D supplementation is defined as supplementing with vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status ( 114502 ). In adults, vitamin D supplementation does not seem to reduce the risk of RTIs. Observational research in adults has found that low levels of vitamin D are associated with worsened RTI complications, and even increased mortality in older adults ages 50-75 years ( 103659 ). However, meta-analyses of prospective clinical trials in adults show that taking vitamin D supplements 300-4000 IU daily for 7 weeks to 5 years or taking vitamin D 30,000-100,000 IU monthly or 96,000-120,000 IU every 2 months for 1-5 years does not reduce the odds of developing an RTI or severe respiratory complications, such as emergency department utilization, hospitalization, and death, when compared with placebo. These results were similar in subgroup analyses evaluating overall vitamin D dose and baseline vitamin D status ( 84689 , 105721 , 114506 ). The largest single clinical trial, conducted in adults at least 60 years of age, shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 60,000 IU once monthly for up to 5 years reduces the duration of total and severe respiratory symptoms by approximately 0.5 days, but does not reduce the incidence of respiratory illness or hospitalization, when compared with placebo ( 105726 , 110825 ). When adults and children are evaluated together, vitamin D supplementation does not seem to reduce the risk of respiratory infections. Two large meta-analyses of 40 clinical studies in both children and adults shows that taking vitamin D does not reduce the risk of acute RTIs. While subgroup analyses suggest a potential modest reduction in risk of acute RTIs in studies not exceeding 4 months' duration and with daily supplementation of 400-1200 IU during winter, spring, and autumn, these findings are limited by the low quality of the evidence and publication bias ( 108435 , 115582 ). Vitamin D has also been evaluated for the treatment of RTIs. A large meta-analysis of clinical studies in both children and adults shows that taking vitamin D improves outcomes (e.g., sputum conversion, survival rate, therapeutic success, need for intensive care admission) by a small, but not clinically relevant, amount. In subgroup analyses, these beneficial effects only persisted in studies considered to be of low quality ( 108436 ). The validity of these findings is limited by publication bias. more Tooth retention. Oral vitamin D with calcium seems to help with tooth retention in the elderly population. A clinical trial in the elderly population shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 700 IU daily along with calcium citrate malate 500 mg daily orally for 3 years reduces the risk of tooth loss by about 52% when compared with placebo ( 8816 ). more Possibly Ineffective Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most research shows that taking vitamin D with or without calcium does not reduce the risk of CVD or CVD complications. There is some speculation that there might be modest benefit in the elderly, but more research is needed to confirm. Population research has found that low vitamin D levels, especially those below 15 ng/mL, are associated with an increased risk of developing CVD ( 15630 , 16618 , 93944 , 113588 ). However, taking vitamin D supplements does not seem to prevent CVD. The majority of evidence from clinical research, population research, and meta-analyses shows that vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, does not reduce the risk of mortality, myocardial infarction, cardiac-related hospitalizations, or stroke when compared with placebo in patients with or without CVD risk factors ( 91343 , 97296 , 97305 , 97308 , 98902 , 98916 , 99762 , 109729 , 110811 , 110827 )( 112021 , 112022 , 113588 ). The most reliable evidence comes from two meta-analyses of mainly high-quality clinical research investigating the effect of supplementation with vitamin D alone or with calcium for at least 1 year. These analyses show that vitamin D does not reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, stroke, CVD mortality, or all-cause mortality, regardless of baseline vitamin D level, vitamin D dosage, sex, formulation, or concomitant calcium supplementation ( 99762 , 109729 ). One large clinical trial in individuals at increased CVD risk shows that taking vitamin D as cholecalciferol 60,000 IU monthly modestly INCREASES the risk of CVD- and presumed CVD-related mortality ( 110827 ). The effect of vitamin D supplementation in elderly adults on CVD outcomes has also been evaluated. In some research, taking vitamin D 700-1000 IU daily shows a trend towards lower CVD events and reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in elderly patients ( 11931 , 98916 , 99762 ). However, another study in adults aged 70 years or older without a history of cardiovascular events and who are vitamin D replete at baseline shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily for 3 years does not decrease the risk of coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, or hypertension when compared with placebo ( 113581 ). Larger, high-quality trials with prespecified primary outcomes are needed to determine whether or not vitamin D supplementation reduces CVD risk in elderly populations. more Critical illness (trauma). Taking vitamin D 540,000 IU as a single oral dose does not reduce death or hospital stay in critically ill patients. However, limited research suggests that taking a smaller dose of vitamin D long-term might have a modest benefit. The most robust evidence to date shows that correcting vitamin D levels in critically ill patients with vitamin D deficiency does not reduce mortality rate or duration of hospital stay. A large, multicenter clinical study in critically ill patients with vitamin D deficiency shows that administering a single, enteral dose of vitamin D 540,000 IU does not reduce 90-day all-cause mortality, duration of hospital stay, ventilator-free days, or other clinical outcomes when compared with placebo ( 103656 ). A previous meta-analysis of clinical research showed that vitamin D supplementation administered for a duration of 7 days or up to 6 months reduces the risk of death by 30% in critically ill hospitalized patients ( 95913 ). However, included studies were of low methodological quality, had high heterogeneity, assessed patients with and without vitamin D deficiency, and used variable vitamin D dose regimens and administrations methods ( 95913 , 95914 ). more Fractures. Most evidence shows that oral vitamin D alone does NOT prevent factures in people who do not have osteoporosis. Some research shows that taking vitamin D with calcium prevents fractures; however, more research is needed to determine who is most likely to benefit. Clinical research shows that taking vitamin D alone does not seem to prevent fractures in older adults. Most adults in these studies did not have osteoporosis, although osteoporosis status was unclear in some research ( 10140 , 12933 , 14282 , 38970 , 39015 , 84660 , 95822 , 97296 , 102145 , 104619 )( 109059 , 110827 ). However, several meta-analyses suggest that taking higher doses of vitamin D (about 800 IU daily) in combination with calcium might reduce overall fracture risk in older patients ( 38942 , 38970 , 39015 , 84660 , 102145 , 110809 ). One meta-analysis of clinical research in community- or long-term care-living males and females at least 65 years of age shows that taking vitamin D 800 IU daily in combination with calcium reduces the risk of hip and non-vertebral fractures by 25% and 20%, respectively, compared with placebo ( 110809 ). However, discrepancies exist which are possibly related to the dose and form of calcium used in combination with vitamin D and/or the patient population. Some research shows that taking vitamin D 800 IU daily in combination with calcium 1200 mg daily as tricalcium phosphate reduces fracture risk by up to 31% while taking vitamin D with calcium carbonate does not reduce fracture risk ( 12929 , 14282 , 16878 , 110809 ). Some individual clinical studies in postmenopausal females aged 50-79 years show that taking vitamin D plus calcium daily for 2-7 years does not prevent fractures when compared with placebo ( 14282 , 16878 ). Other confounding variables include the possible additional effects of hormonal therapy when given with calcium to postmenopausal adults and/or the inclusion of institutionalized patients with unclear osteoporotic status ( 95822 , 97296 ). Most research shows that taking vitamin D in combination with omega-3 fatty acids does not prevent fractures. A large clinical study shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily alone or with omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily and/or strength training three times weekly does not prevent fractures in adults over 70 years of age when compared with placebo ( 104619 ). Another large clinical trial shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily, alone or with omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily, over approximately 5 years does not prevent overall fractures, nonvertebral fractures, or hip fractures in adults over 50 (males) or 55 (females) years old when compared with placebo. Although the osteoporosis status of the population was unclear, findings were consistent in adults at high fracture risk based on use of osteoporosis medications and/or a history of fragility fractures ( 109059 ). As of April 2018, the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against supplementing with vitamin D 400 IU daily or less along with calcium 1000 mg daily or less for preventing primary fractures in community-dwelling postmenopausal adults. The USPSTF also concludes that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether supplementing with doses of vitamin D greater than 400 IU daily along with calcium doses greater than 1000 mg daily is safe or effective for preventing fractures in community dwelling adults without vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or a history of fracture ( 95695 ). For information on patients WITH osteoporosis, refer to the Osteoporosis discussion. There is limited research available regarding the effects of vitamin D supplementation for fracture prevention in children. Preliminary research in children aged 2 to 17 years with vitamin D insufficiency and one or more previous fractures shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily with calcium 600 mg daily for 6 months modestly reduces the risk of forearm fractures over 12 months compared with children not given vitamin D or calcium ( 110820 ). more Hypertension. Overall, vitamin D does not seem to prevent or lower high blood pressure in most patients; however, it may lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients with vitamin D deficiency. Although population research has found that lower vitamin D levels are associated with a higher risk of developing hypertension, clinical research shows vitamin D supplementation does not prevent hypertension ( 15630 ). A large clinical trial in postmenopausal adults shows that taking vitamin D3 400 IU with calcium 1000 mg daily does not reduce the risk of developing hypertension ( 16714 ). Most meta-analyses and clinical trials in patients with existing hypertension show that vitamin D supplementation does not lower blood pressure when compared with placebo, regardless of vitamin D formulation, dose, or duration of supplementation ( 16714 , 91340 , 96405 , 103657 , 104619 , 113583 , 113668 ). However, a meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies in patients with hypertension and vitamin D deficiency shows that supplementation with vitamin D reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by about 7 mmHg and 3 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 100895 ). Another meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials in patients over 60 years of age with hypertension and vitamin D deficiency shows that taking vitamin D supplements significantly reduces systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure when compared with placebo, especially in trials lasting more than 8 weeks where the total dose of vitamin D is above 400,000 IU ( 113592 ). An individual clinical study in patients with hypertension and vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly or 1000 IU daily reduces systolic blood pressure by about 6 mmHg and mean arterial pressure by about 4 mmHg, but does not affect diastolic blood pressure, when compared to baseline ( 108440 ). more Prostate cancer. Oral vitamin D does not appear to affect prostate cancer progression or cancer-related mortality. A meta-analysis of three clinical trials shows that vitamin D supplementation does not affect prostate cancer progression as measured by prostate-specific antigen (PSA), or mortality in patients with prostate cancer ( 99770 ). more Psychosis. Oral vitamin D does not seem to improve symptoms in patients with a functional psychotic disorder. A clinical study in adults with a functional psychotic disorder shows that taking oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 20,000 IU monthly for 6 months has no effect on total positive and negative syndrome scale score (PANSS) when compared with placebo. The majority of patients included in this study were deficient in vitamin D at baseline ( 107226 ). more Tuberculosis. Oral vitamin D seems to be ineffective for reducing the severity of tuberculosis or mortality from tuberculosis. Limited research suggests that vitamin D may have small benefits in newly diagnosed patients receiving tuberculosis treatment for the first time. Although population research has found that tuberculosis is associated with vitamin D deficiency, most clinical research shows that taking vitamin D does not improve clinical outcomes in people with tuberculosis infection. Meta-analyses and individual clinical studies show that taking vitamin D as a single 100,000 IU dose, or as 400 IU daily for 2 months, along with standard care does not improve tuberculosis severity or reduce the risk of mortality in children or adults with tuberculosis, regardless of their baseline vitamin D levels ( 82570 , 82475 , 98913 , 103655 , 103668 , 104022 ). However, some research has identified modest benefits in newly diagnosed patients receiving anti-tuberculosis treatment for the first time. A meta-analysis of clinical research in this population shows that taking vitamin D at a dose of 1000 IU daily or 600,000 IU monthly modestly increases the odds of sputum smear conversions by 1.2-fold, but does not improve the time to sputum smear conversions, when compared with placebo ( 98235 ). A small clinical study in treatment-naïve adults with low levels of serum vitamin D shows that taking calcitriol 0.25 mcg twice daily for up to 6 months, starting with anti-tuberculosis treatment initiation, decreases the time to sputum smear conversion and 50% lesion absorption by about 3 days when compared with not taking vitamin D ( 109045 ). Additionally, a small clinical study in children aged 6-18 years with vitamin D insufficiency receiving standard treatment for newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis shows that taking vitamin D 1000 IU daily reduces the duration of fever and cough by 1 and 2 weeks, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 108437 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acne. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for acne. A small clinical trial in patients with acne and vitamin D deficiency shows that taking cholecalciferol 1,000 IU daily for 2 months reduces the number of inflammatory lesions by about 35%, compared with 6% in those taking placebo. There was no effect on the total or non-inflammatory lesion count ( 106127 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking alfacalcidol (One Alpha, LEO Company, Denmark) 0.25 mcg daily for 3 months modestly improves acne severity when compared with taking placebo ( 106128 ). In addition, population research has found that individuals with acne have modestly lower vitamin D levels than healthy controls. The odds of vitamin D deficiency were approximately three times higher in patients with acne when compared with healthy controls ( 106105 ). more Age-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral cholecalciferol is beneficial for preventing age-related cognitive decline. Pooled results of two large clinical sub-studies in community-dwelling adults aged 60 years or older show that taking cholecalciferol 2000 IU daily for 2-3 years has no effect on cognitive decline when compared with placebo. A subgroup analysis in Black patients suggests a modest effect of vitamin D when compared with placebo ( 108428 ). more Alzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for this condition. Some population research has found that lower serum concentrations of vitamin D are associated with higher risk of Alzheimer disease, and also with decreased cognition. People with Alzheimer disease seem to have serum concentrations of vitamin D that are about 2.5 ng/mL lower than patients without Alzheimer disease ( 84672 , 103666 ). However, other population research has found that vitamin D deficiency (&lt;25 nmol/L) or insufficiency (25-50 nmol/L) is not associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease ( 100899 ). more Asthma. Oral vitamin D might reduce asthma exacerbations in adults and children with mild, but not severe or persistent, asthma. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy or the first 6 months of an infant's life does not seem to prevent the development of asthma later in infancy or childhood. Population research in patients with asthma suggests that low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of exacerbations and increased need for medication therapy ( 94693 ). However, findings from clinical research are mixed. Some meta-analyses of clinical trials in adults and children with asthma show that taking vitamin D for 3 months to 1 year reduces the rate of asthma exacerbations by 31% to 38% when compared with control ( 92690 , 94686 , 115584 ). However, other meta-analyses show that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations when compared with placebo ( 109728 , 109732 , 110833 ). The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear. However, some clinical research suggests that vitamin D supplements might only prevent asthma in people with non-persistent asthma ( 92690 , 94685 , 94686 , 94688 , 104020 ). Also, many studies are small and do not represent patients with severe asthma exacerbations ( 92690 , 94687 ). Baseline levels of vitamin D may play a role. A clinical study in children aged 6-16 years with persistent asthma and low vitamin D levels shows that taking vitamin D 4000 IU daily for 48 weeks does not reduce severe asthma exacerbations when compared with placebo ( 104020 ). However, a meta-analysis including this study shows that taking vitamin D does reduce risk of asthma exacerbations in children with low baseline vitamin D levels ( 109728 ). Additionally, two meta-analyses show that taking vitamin D seems to modestly improve pulmonary function when compared with placebo ( 109732 , 115584 ). Vitamin D doses have varied, with oral doses of 200-4000 IU daily, 1000-14,000 IU once weekly, 60,000 IU once monthly, 120,000 IU every 2 months, 100,000 IU 14 days apart, or 100,000 to 600,000 IU as a bolus dose followed by 400-4000 IU daily ( 92690 , 94686 , 104020 , 109728 , 110833 , 115584 ). Vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of asthma in infants has also been evaluated. A meta-analysis of 4 large clinical studies shows that taking vitamin D 400-1200 IU daily for the first 6 months of life does not reduce the risk of asthma or wheezing at 6-30 months of age when compared with control ( 112031 ). Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy has also been evaluated ( 97306 , 99763 , 102146 , 112031 ). A meta-analysis of 3 large clinical studies shows that taking vitamin D 2800-4400 IU daily during the 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters of pregnancy reduces the risk of recurrent wheezing by 23% but does not reduce the risk of asthma diagnosis within the first 3-6 years of life when compared with vitamin D 400 IU daily ( 112031 ). Some research suggests that the dose of vitamin D plays a role. A meta-analysis shows that prenatal vitamin D 800 IU daily reduces the odds of wheeze or asthma by 32%, while lower or higher vitamin D doses were not beneficial ( 103661 ). more Athletic performance. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for athletic performance. One small clinical trial in athletes shows that taking vitamin D 20,000 or 40,000 IU once weekly for 2 doses does not affect performance on vertical jumps, sprints, or leg and bench presses when compared with placebo ( 98188 ). Another small clinical trial in professional rugby players shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 50,000 IU once every two weeks over 12 weeks does not improve sprinting speed or the ability to perform bench presses, bench pulls, and chin-ups when compared with placebo ( 98189 ). Also, most research shows that taking vitamin D does not improve measures of cardiorespiratory fitness. One small study in young males undergoing resistance training shows that taking vitamin D 8000 IU daily for 12 weeks does not improve cardiorespiratory fitness compared with taking placebo ( 110812 ). more Atopic dermatitis (eczema). Most research shows that oral vitamin D reduces eczema severity in children. However, most research shows that oral vitamin D, taken during pregnancy or infancy, does not prevent eczema in the child. A meta-analysis of eight moderate-quality clinical trials in children shows that taking vitamin D, most commonly 1000-2000 IU daily for 4-12 weeks, modestly reduces severity of eczema when compared with placebo ( 109728 ). Most of the children in these studies were also given conventional medications. Oral vitamin D has also been evaluated for eczema prevention. A meta-analysis of two clinical studies shows that consuming vitamin D 2800-4400 IU daily during the 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters of pregnancy is not associated with a reduced risk for eczema in children during the first 3 years of life when compared with vitamin D 400 IU daily ( 97306 ). Another meta-analysis of five large clinical studies shows that prenatal or infant vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the risk of developing eczema when compared with low-dose vitamin D, placebo, or no intervention ( 108438 ). more Atrial fibrillation. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for preventing atrial fibrillation. A large clinical trial in adults without cardiovascular disease shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily for an average of 5 years does not reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation when compared with placebo or fish oil 840 mg daily ( 105209 ). However, observational research in postmenopausal adults with osteoporosis found that vitamin D supplementation is associated with a lower occurrence of atrial fibrillation when compared with not taking vitamin D ( 98922 ). Also, one large observational study in vitamin D-deficient patients with no history of atrial fibrillation has found that vitamin D supplementation for at least 6 months is associated with up to a 16% decreased risk of atrial fibrillation when compared with not taking vitamin D. There were also modest improvements in atrial fibrillation-free survival. In males 65 years and older with hypertension or diabetes at baseline, blood levels of at least 30 ng/mL following vitamin D supplementation were associated with decreased risk of atrial fibrillation; a post-supplementation blood level of 21-29 ng/mL was not associated with decreased risk ( 109043 ). more Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for ADHD. A small clinical trial in children 5-12 years of age with ADHD and vitamin D insufficiency shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily along with methylphenidate for 8 weeks seems to improve parental ratings of evening, but not morning or overall, symptoms of inattentiveness and impulsivity when compared with methylphenidate alone. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as levels less than 30 ng/mL ( 98196 ). Based on these and other preliminary findings, Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that vitamin D in doses of 1500 to 4000 IU daily is weakly recommended for adjunctive use in children with ADHD, especially those with insufficient intake or skin exposure to sunlight ( 110318 ). more Autism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for autism spectrum disorder. A small clinical study in children aged 2.5-8 years with autism spectrum disorder shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily for 12 months modestly reduces irritability and hyperactivity when compared with placebo ( 99767 ). more Autoimmune thyroiditis. It is unclear of oral vitamin D improves outcomes in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. A meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis shows that taking vitamin D for at least 12 weeks increases free triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels, and reduces levels of thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin antibody, and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody, when compared with placebo or no treatment ( 113593 ). more Back pain. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for reducing chronic low back pain. A meta-analysis of 10 clinical studies in adults with chronic low back pain shows that taking vitamin D does not reduce pain scores when compared with placebo, regardless of baseline vitamin D status or duration of supplementation. Oral vitamin D dosages used in these studies included 400-4000 IU daily for 1-6 months, 50,000 IU once weekly for 8 weeks, or 150,000-300,000 IU as a single dose. Intramuscular dosages ranged from 150,000-300,00 IU as a single dose ( 115588 ). more Bacterial vaginosis. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for bacterial vaginosis. Preliminary clinical research in females at high risk for sexually transmitted disease shows that taking vitamin D along with standard therapy for bacterial vaginosis does not reduce the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis when compared with placebo. Patients in this study had been treated with metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days along with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 50,000 IU each week for 4 weeks and then every 4 weeks for the remaining 20 weeks ( 91348 ). more Bariatric surgery complications. It is unclear if vitamin D supplementation after bariatric surgery attenuates any bone health-related complications. Clinical research in adults who had undergone bariatric surgery shows that vitamin D supplementation in doses of 800-7900 IU daily improves vitamin D status when compared with placebo. It is unclear if vitamin D supplementation in these doses for 1 year improves parathyroid hormone levels or bone mineral density or reduces fracture risk ( 115589 ). more Breast cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the prevention of breast cancer. Some population research evaluating intake of calcium plus vitamin D suggests that higher vitamin D intake is not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in premenopausal or postmenopausal adults ( 15631 ). Similarly, a large observational study in females with a biological sibling with breast cancer has found that taking vitamin D recently or prior to enrollment is not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer when compared with nonrecent vitamin D use or never taking vitamin D, respectively ( 107215 ). However, other research found that higher vitamin D intake is associated with a 17% reduced risk of breast cancer in premenopausal and perimenopausal, but not postmenopausal, adults ( 39001 ). Observational research has also examined the association between blood levels of vitamin D and risk of developing breast cancer. A meta-analysis found that those with serum levels of about 52 ng/mL had a 50% lower risk of developing breast cancer when compared with those with serum levels of less than 13 ng/mL. This high serum level of vitamin D corresponds to a high dose of about 4000 IU daily ( 16049 ). Other observational research has found that baseline vitamin D levels of more than 20 ng/mL are associated with a 48% reduced risk of developing breast cancer over approximately 9 years in Latina females in the US when compared with levels below 20 ng/mL; however, this association was not present in Black females ( 109058 ). Despite the contradictory findings from observational research, results from clinical research are generally negative. Evidence from one large-scale clinical trial (Women's Health Initiative) shows that postmenopausal adults who take vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 400 IU daily plus calcium 1000 mg daily for 7 years do not have a significantly reduced risk of developing breast cancer ( 16715 , 98895 ). Also, a meta-analysis of two large-scale clinical trials, which did not include the Women's Health Initiative trial, shows that taking vitamin D 800-1000 IU daily, alone or with calcium, for 3-4 years does not reduce the incidence of breast cancer in postmenopausal adults, although there was a trend towards reduced risk with higher doses of vitamin D supplementation ( 97301 ). While vitamin D and calcium supplementation during the intervention period of the Women's Health Initiative trial was not associated with a reduced risk of developing breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a precursor to breast cancer, a secondary post-hoc analysis of the data shows that supplementation reduces the risk of developing DCIS by 18% over a median follow-up of 19 years ( 107216 ). Additional research is needed regarding an optimal dose of vitamin D, timing of initiation, and whether any benefit is affected by menopausal status. more Bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Limited research suggests that vitamin D deficiency is linked with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the infant. Observational research has found that vitamin D deficiency at birth is associated with about a 2-fold increased odds of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( 104021 ). However, it is unclear if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial. more Cancer. Vitamin D does not seem to reduce overall cancer risk. However, some research shows that vitamin D might slightly reduce the risk of metastatic cancer and cancer-related mortality. There is interest in vitamin D for cancer PREVENTION, as observational research suggests that higher vitamin D intake and higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with a lower risk of cancer ( 111150 ). While individual clinical trials evaluating vitamin D for cancer have produced inconsistent findings, most meta-analyses and clinical trials show that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) alone or with calcium does not significantly reduce the risk of developing cancer ( 15629 , 91344 , 93943 , 97296 , 98916 , 104024 , 104618 , 110811 ). However, vitamin D supplementation might reduce the risk of metastatic cancer and cancer-related mortality. A large clinical trial shows that taking vitamin D3 2000 IU daily for a median of 5.3 years slightly reduces the risk of advanced metastatic or fatal cancers when compared with placebo ( 104618 ). Additionally, meta-analyses of several large clinical trials show that taking vitamin D 400-4000 IU daily, with or without calcium, for 1-7 years reduces the risk of cancer-related mortality by 12-13% when compared with control, while intermittent bolus dosing of vitamin D at high doses for 1-5 years does not appear to reduce the risk of cancer-related mortality ( 104024 , 111149 ). The role of vitamin D in cancer TREATMENT is unclear. A meta-analysis of clinical and observational research suggests that supplementation of vitamin D after a cancer diagnosis is associated with a modest improvement in overall survival, but not progression-free or cancer-specific survival ( 109726 ). Doses used in clinical research ranged between 1200 IU and 8000 IU daily or 100,000 IU every 50 days, after surgery and/or during treatment ( 99195 , 99196 , 109726 ). Other clinical research in patients with luminal gastrointestinal cancers shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily does not reduce the risk of relapse when compared with placebo ( 99195 ). It is unclear which, if any, types or stages of cancer respond best to vitamin D, and what dose of vitamin D is optimal. more Child growth. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for improving infant growth or bone structure. Meta-analyses and individual clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy modestly increases length at birth and bone mineral density at up to 7 years of age when compared with control, usually placebo or vitamin D 400 IU daily. However, there was no effect on length in the infant up to one year of age, weight at birth or up to one year of age, head circumference at birth or up to 6 years of age, bone mineral content at up to 6 years of age, or neonatal bone mineral density, bone mineral content, bone area, or femur or humoral length ( 98198 , 109737 , 112028 , 115585 ). In the available research, vitamin D was taken in doses of 200 IU to 4400 IU daily, 4200 IU to 50,000 IU weekly, 50,000 IU every 2 weeks, or 60,000 IU every 4-8 weeks, starting from the early to late stages of pregnancy and usually continued until birth ( 98198 , 109737 , 115585 ). more Chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with CKD. Most research suggests that it does not reduce the risk for adverse cardiovascular events. Population research in patients on dialysis has found that vitamin D levels less than 17.8 ng/mL are associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with higher levels ( 16619 ). A meta-analysis and individual clinical studies show that vitamin D and vitamin D analogues decrease parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and urine protein levels in people with CKD ( 84376 , 84377 , 84628 , 98233 , 98236 ). However, taking vitamin D does not appear to decrease the risk of death or parathyroidectomy in CKD patients ( 84376 , 84377 ). Also, taking vitamin D increases the risk for hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia in this patient population ( 84376 , 84377 , 98236 ). Vitamin D has also been evaluated for the prevention of cardiovascular events in adults with CKD. Observational research has found that vitamin D deficiency in patients with CKD is associated with adverse cardiovascular events. However, vitamin D supplementation does not seem to be beneficial. One clinical study shows that taking paricalcitol, an active form of vitamin D, titrated to maintain adequate serum calcium levels, for 48 weeks does not affect the size of the left ventricle or heart function when compared with placebo ( 98233 ). Other clinical research in Japanese patients on hemodialysis for CKD shows that adding alfacalcidol, another active form of vitamin D, 0.5 mcg daily to standard treatment for 4 years does not affect mortality or cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarctions, stroke, aortic dissection, and others compared to standard treatment only ( 98920 ). Also, a large clinical trial in patients with CKD shows that taking vitamin D as cholecalciferol 2000 IU daily, alone or with omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily, does not affect major cardiovascular events or invasive cancer when compared with placebo ( 110811 ). Vitamin D has also been evaluated for musculoskeletal health in adults with CKD. A small clinical study shows that taking cholecalciferol 4000 IU daily, with or without physical activity, for 3 months improves bicep strength, but not back flexibility or aerobic fitness capacity, when compared with baseline. In patients taking cholecalciferol in combination with physical activity, musculoskeletal health was similar when compared with cholecalciferol alone ( 108431 ). However, this study was inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups, and it is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups. Vitamin D has also been evaluated for the improvement of iron status in adults with CKD and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Clinical research shows that taking Vitamin D as cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 Forte Renapharma) 8000 IU daily for 12 weeks does not improve iron status compared with taking placebo. However, a sub-analysis shows that hemoglobin levels are modestly improved in patients with a low Vitamin D status at baseline suggesting that Vitamin D might improve iron availability in these patients ( 110819 ). more Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for COPD; benefits may be limited to patients with severe vitamin D deficiency. Population research has found an association between low vitamin D levels and reduced lung function, increased risk of developing COPD, and worsening COPD severity ( 17685 , 96401 ). However, 3 meta-analyses of clinical research in adults with COPD show that, overall, oral vitamin D does not have beneficial effects on mortality, rate of COPD exacerbations, pulmonary function, or most measures of symptom severity when compared with placebo ( 109732 , 112485 , 115586 ). A subgroup analysis suggests that any benefits of vitamin D supplementation may be limited to patients with severe vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 25 nmol/L) at baseline ( 115586 ). more Cognitive function. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for cognitive function. Population research has found that low vitamin D levels are associated with worse cognitive performance and cognitive decline when compared to high vitamin D levels in healthy adults ( 84672 , 95916 ). However, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cognitive function is unclear. One small meta-analysis of clinical research shows that vitamin D supplementation does not improve cognitive function ( 95916 ). However, the included trials evaluated a widely heterogeneous study population and utilized variable measures of cognitive function. more Cognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for older adults with mild cognitive impairment. A small clinical study in older adults with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking vitamin D3 10,000 IU three times weekly for 20 weeks in addition to exercise and cognitive training does not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo and exercise with or without cognitive training. However, most participants had sufficient serum vitamin D levels at baseline ( 112489 ). more Colorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of colorectal cancer. Epidemiological research has found that a higher serum vitamin D level is associated with decreased risk of mortality and increased survival in patients with colorectal cancer ( 16101 , 99196 ). However, it is unclear whether vitamin D supplementation improves survival in patients with colorectal cancer, as research has generally involved small populations and results are somewhat conflicting. A subgroup analysis of one clinical study shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily does not reduce the risk of relapse or death, death due to any cause, or relapse over 5 years when compared with placebo in patients with colorectal cancer ( 99195 ). However, this subgroup may have been underpowered to detect between-group differences. Another small clinical trial in patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer shows that taking high-dose vitamin D 8000 IU daily during the first cycle of chemotherapy, and then 4000 IU daily for subsequent cycles, does not increase median progression-free survival when compared with taking vitamin D 400 IU daily. However, patients taking high-dose vitamin D were 36% less likely to experience disease progression or death during follow-up when compared with patients taking the lower dose of vitamin D ( 99196 ). This latter result suggests that high-dose vitamin D supplementation might be beneficial for patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, but larger, multicenter studies are needed to confirm. The role of vitamin D in colorectal cancer prevention has also been investigated. A meta-analysis of epidemiological research has found that a higher serum vitamin D level is associated with a decreased colorectal cancer risk; however, sub-analyses suggest that this association only occurs in females, not males ( 109740 ). Most studies have evaluated vitamin D supplements in combination with calcium; the effects of vitamin D supplementation alone are unclear. One meta-analysis of clinical research suggests that taking vitamin D plus calcium is not associated with a decreased incidence of colorectal cancer in people with a low baseline risk of colorectal cancer ( 39042 ). Another meta-analysis of clinical research shows that vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, does not reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer or colorectal adenomas ( 109730 ). Additionally, a large clinical trial suggests that postmenopausal adults who take calcium 1000 mg daily plus vitamin D 400 IU daily do not have a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer ( 14290 , 98895 ). One clinical study shows that taking calcium supplements reduces the risk of colorectal adenomas, but not in people with lower than average vitamin D levels ( 12118 ). more Crohn disease. Limited evidence suggests that vitamin D reduces relapses in patients with Crohn disease. A meta-analysis of small, low-quality clinical studies in patients with IBD, including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, shows that taking high- or low-dose vitamin D for up to 1 year reduces the rate of relapse when compared with control ( 98915 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. more Dementia. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for dementia. Population research has found that patients with any type of dementia have serum concentrations of vitamin D that are about 2.5 ng/mL lower than patients without dementia ( 84672 ). However, it is unclear if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial. more Depression. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for treating depression. Vitamin D does not seem to prevent the development of depression. The role of vitamin D in the treatment of depression is unclear. Earlier meta-analyses of clinical research show that vitamin D supplementation does not improve overall symptoms of depression. However, some subgroup analyses suggest that vitamin D may be beneficial for improving the symptoms of depression in people with clinically significant symptoms, as well as those with baseline vitamin D deficiency ( 97295 , 97298 ). More recent meta-analyses of several clinical trials, that include some of the same studies, show that vitamin D modestly improves symptoms of depression in adults; however, subgroup analysis suggests that vitamin D does not improve depressive symptoms in older adults ( 110832 , 112786 ). These analyses are mixed over whether baseline vitamin D status affects results ( 110832 , 112786 ) and one of these analyses shows no evidence that the type of depression affects findings ( 110832 ). Another meta-analysis of generally small clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes and depression shows that taking vitamin D modestly improves depressive symptoms when compared with placebo or no intervention ( 110814 ). Although, results of an individual clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes are in contrast ( 108423 ). The evaluated research implemented one-time doses of 150,000-500,000 IU, as well as daily and weekly doses ranging between 400-5000 IU daily or 5000-100,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks to 2 years, with the most evidence of benefit related to one-time high doses. Cholecalciferol was the most common form of vitamin D used ( 97295 , 97298 , 108423 , 110814 , 110832 , 112786 ). Significant heterogeneity between studies and the wide variability in dosing strategies limit the validity of these findings, as well as identification of an effective dose or target population. Vitamin D has also been evaluated for the prevention of depression. One large clinical study (VITAL-DEP) in healthy patients 50 years and older shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily for about 5.3 years does not prevent depression or depressive symptoms, or improve mood, when compared with placebo ( 103670 ). An analysis of a cohort of patients from the VITAL-DEP trial also shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily for 2 years does not reduce the risk of major depressive disorder or improve mood scores in patients with subthreshold depression or risk factors for late-life depression when compared with placebo ( 112032 ). In addition, a meta-analysis of several clinical studies suggests that vitamin D supplementation does not prevent depression based on subgroup analysis of patients without depression at baseline ( 112786 ). Based on these and other preliminary findings, Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that vitamin D in doses of 1500 to 4000 IU daily is weakly recommended for adjunctive or monotherapy use in patients with depression, especially those with insufficient intake or skin exposure to sunlight ( 110318 ). more Diabetes. Oral vitamin D might improve glycemic indices in some patients with type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes. It is unclear if oral or intramuscular vitamin D is beneficial for the prevention of type 1 or gestational diabetes. Most meta-analyses of mainly small clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial for measures of glycemic control in adults with diabetes. However, the best evidence of benefit is in people with baseline vitamin D deficiency. Five meta-analyses of clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes show that vitamin D supplementation reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.2% to 0.3%, and improves serum insulin, fasting blood glucose, and measures of insulin resistance when compared with control ( 96403 , 110822 , 112487 , 115581 , 115583 ). Supplemental vitamin D seems to be most beneficial in patients with baseline vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency ( 96403 , 107210 , 110822 , 112487 , 115581 ). Furthermore, correlation analysis suggests an inverse relationship between serum vitamin D levels and serum insulin, fasting blood glucose, and measures of insulin resistance ( 112487 ). In most clinical studies vitamin D supplementation ranged from 1000-6000 IU daily, 20,000-60,000 IU weekly, or 100,000-400,000 IU once over 8-48 weeks ( 96403 , 107210 , 110822 , 115581 , 115583 ). Most analyses exhibited significant heterogeneity related to vitamin D dosing regimen, geographic location, and patient population. However, one meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with diabetes shows that vitamin D improves HbA1c, insulin resistance, and insulin measures in studies lasting less than 6 months, but not in studies lasting longer than 6 months ( 99764 ). An additional meta-analysis suggests that most evidence of benefit is associated with doses of more than 2000 IU daily for 4-12 weeks ( 110822 ). Another meta-analysis suggests that benefits may be greater in adults with less severe obesity and a shorter duration of type 2 diabetes ( 115583 ). Vitamin D has been evaluated for the prevention of type 1 diabetes. There is preliminary evidence that daily vitamin D supplementation (form not specified) in infants during the first year of life is associated with a reduced incidence of type 1 diabetes development later in life ( 10139 ). Also, a meta-analysis of population studies has found that vitamin D supplementation in early childhood is associated with a 29% reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes later in life ( 84225 ). Vitamin D has been evaluated in adults with gestational diabetes, yielding conflicting findings. One clinical trial shows that oral vitamin D 50,000 IU every 4 weeks modestly reduces levels of insulin, as well as measures of insulin resistance, with no effect on fasting blood glucose ( 106125 ), whereas other clinical research shows that this same dosing regimen modestly reduces levels of fasting blood glucose and HbA1c, with no effect on insulin measures ( 106126 ). A separate clinical study shows that taking oral vitamin D 500 IU twice daily in yogurt modestly improves all measures of glycemic indices ( 101775 ). Additionally, a large clinical trial shows that taking oral vitamin D 1600 IU daily modestly reduces fasting blood glucose when compared with vitamin D 400 IU daily ( 112020 ). Some clinical research also shows that oral vitamin D modestly improves levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with control ( 106125 , 110823 ), although not all research agrees ( 106126 ). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking oral vitamin D reduces the risk of premature birth and neonatal hospitalization by approximately 63% and 62%, respectively ( 110823 ). A meta-analysis of 5 small clinical studies shows that taking oral vitamin D 400-1000 IU daily for 6 weeks or 50,000 IU twice over 6 weeks along with calcium decreases fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin when compared with placebo ( 115579 ). One small clinical study shows that giving vitamin D 300,000 IU as a single intramuscular injection at 24-28 weeks' gestation does not affect HbA1c ( 106124 ). Vitamin D has also been evaluated for the prevention of gestational diabetes. A Cochrane analysis of one large clinical study shows that taking vitamin D during pregnancy does not lower the risk of gestational diabetes when compared with no supplementation ( 114587 ). In addition, a meta-analysis of population studies suggests that there is a U-shaped association between serum vitamin D levels and the risk of developing gestational diabetes, with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 40-90 nmol/L associated with the lowest risk ( 106109 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with insulin resistance during pregnancy, but not gestational diabetes, shows that taking vitamin D at varying doses for 6-26 weeks modestly decreases measures of insulin resistance when compared with placebo ( 110821 ). However, this study did not evaluate whether vitamin D prevented the development of gestational diabetes in these patients. Vitamin D has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One study evaluated vitamin D in combination with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 360 mg plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 240 mg twice daily, suggesting that this combination improves glycemic markers when compared with taking vitamin D alone ( 106122 ). Other clinical research in patients with gestational diabetes shows that taking vitamin D with omega-3 fatty acids 8,000 mg twice daily for 6 weeks modestly improves glycemic indices when compared with placebo ( 106114 ). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to vitamin D, other ingredients, or the combination. more Diabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for diabetic foot ulcers. Details : A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with diabetic foot ulcers shows that taking vitamin D modestly reduces ulcer size and improves glycemic and lipid indices when compared with placebo ( 110835 ). This meta-analysis is limited by the availability of three small clinical trials, as well as the heterogeneous doses of vitamin D in the included studies. Diabetic nephropathy. Limited evidence suggests that vitamin D improves some markers of kidney function in patients with diabetic nephropathy. A meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking vitamin D or its analogs reduces inflammatory markers and protein in the urine, but does not affect measures of kidney function such as serum creatinine or glomerular filtration rate, when compared to control ( 99771 ). more Diabetic retinopathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in diabetic retinopathy. There is weak evidence from observational research suggesting a link between vitamin D deficiency and diabetic retinopathy ( 112095 ). However, clinical research addressing the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for treatment or prevention of diabetic retinopathy is lacking. more Dysmenorrhea. Limited evidence suggests that oral vitamin D reduces pain in patients with dysmenorrhea. A meta-analysis of 9 small clinical studies in patients with dysmenorrhea shows that taking vitamin D in doses ranging from 5000 IU daily to 300,000 IU monthly modestly reduces pain when compared with control ( 112029 ). However, the validity of these findings is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity across the studies, including differences in blinding and control interventions, vitamin D doses and frequency of supplementation, and baseline vitamin D levels. Another small clinical study in adolescent patients with dysmenorrhea shows that taking vitamin D3 50,000 IU weekly for 9 weeks modestly reduces pain when compared to baseline ( 98912 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. more Erectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for ED. Although some data suggest ED is associated with low serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels, preliminary research in males aged 60-84 years shows that taking vitamin D 60,000 IU once monthly for up to 5 years does not prevent or improve ED when compared with placebo ( 113580 ). more Exercise-induced muscle damage. Small studies suggest that vitamin D does not improve exercise-induced muscle damage. A meta-analysis of 6 small studies shows that taking vitamin D before and/or during exercise does not improve circulating levels of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, or myoglobin when compared with placebo ( 107218 ). more Fall prevention. The role of vitamin D in fall prevention is confusing and controversial. Most clinical research shows that taking vitamin D 800-1000 IU daily decreases the risk of falls, with effects most apparent with daily over intermittent dosing and in those with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. Taking vitamin D at doses higher or lower than this may be associated with increased risk of falls. Higher serum levels of vitamin D have been associated with improved lower-extremity function in elderly adults ( 15636 ). Clinical research in older adults shows that taking vitamin D or vitamin D analogues, with or without calcium, reduces the number of people who have a fall by up to 19% ( 39038 , 84215 , 84374 , 84539 , 94130 , 104023 , 113595 , 114504 ). Other research shows that vitamin D, with or without calcium, reduces number of falls by 19% to 50% ( 11939 , 16275 , 84404 , 93941 , 109053 ). The beneficial effect does not appear to depend on the form of vitamin D used (ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, calcitriol, or alfacalcidol) ( 39038 , 84374 , 113595 ). Multiple meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking vitamin D leads to a decreased rate of falls in patients with low baseline levels of vitamin D, but not in those with adequate vitamin D levels ( 84670 , 84684 , 109053 , 114504 ). One meta-analysis also suggests that taking vitamin D as cholecalciferol up to 1000 IU daily reduces fall risk by up to 19%, whereas higher doses do not reduce fall risk ( 109053 ). Also, daily dosing, but not intermittent dosing, seems to be associated with a reduced risk of falling ( 109053 , 114504 ). Similarly, another meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin D 800-1000 IU daily, with or without calcium, lowers the risk of falls by about 15-26% when compared with placebo, no treatment, or calcium alone. However, taking vitamin D 500 IU or less daily and vitamin D 1100 IU or more daily, with or without calcium, is not associated with a lower risk of falls and may even increase the risk of falls by 22-44% ( 114504 ). Despite the above meta-analyses, other clinical research shows that vitamin D does not reduce the risk of falling ( 84404 , 84670 ), the rate of falls overall ( 84670 , 93942 ), or the rate of injurious falls ( 93942 ) in elderly patients ( 93942 ). One study in adults over 70 years of age with a history of falling found that taking high-dose vitamin D, either as 60,000 IU monthly or 24,000 IU plus calcifediol 300 mcg monthly, increased both the risk of falling and the mean number of falls compared to a lower dose of 24,000 IU monthly ( 93940 ). One meta-analysis of 20 trials including nearly 30,000 patients shows that taking vitamin D, with or without calcium, does not reduce the risk of falling in elderly patients, regardless of baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D achieved with treatment, duration of treatment, or residential status of the patients ( 91342 ). While a meta-analysis of 10 trials in nearly 6,000 patients shows that taking vitamin D 700-1000 IU daily with calcium 1000-2000 mg daily reduces the risk of falling in the elderly by 12% when compared with placebo or no treatment, a meta-analysis of 21 trials in nearly 52,000 patients shows that vitamin D alone is only associated with a reduced risk of falls in patients with baseline vitamin D levels of less than 50 nmol/L when compared with placebo or no treatment ( 107224 ). The 2018 US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines for fall prevention acknowledges this research by recommending AGAINST vitamin D supplementation for fall prevention in community dwelling adults 65 years of age and older who do not have osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency ( 95703 ). The reasons for the disparate study results may have to do with the way in which clinical trials have reported outcomes. Clinical trials assessing the effect of vitamin D on fall risk may report results as the number of patients who experience one or more falls, the total number of falls, or the rate of falls per individual. This can affect ultimate conclusions and, in some cases, can be misleading. For example, when studies report on only the total number of falls, it is unclear if vitamin D reduces the rate of falls across the study population, or if it only reduces falls in a small subset of patients. Also, analyses of research suggest that the size of the clinical study appears to affect the trial results. Most trials showing significant reductions in fall risk have been small and of short duration ( 91342 , 94132 ); whereas larger and longer-term studies tend to show no benefit ( 13073 , 84399 ). more Fetal and premature infant mortality. Taking vitamin D during pregnancy might reduce the risk of fetal or early infant death. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of intrauterine or neonatal death by 31% when compared with not supplementing with vitamin D. A sub-analysis shows that this benefit was limited to doses of up to 4000 IU daily ( 109055 ). However, a Cochrane review suggests that the evidence linking vitamin D supplementation to a lower risk of fetal or neonatal death is very uncertain ( 114587 ). Clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, based on low certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from fortified foods, vitamin D supplements, or prenatal vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D during pregnancy to potentially lower the risk of intra-uterine and neonatal mortality, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and small for gestational age (SGA) birth. Empiric vitamin D supplementation is defined as supplementing with vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status ( 114502 ). more Fibromyalgia. A small clinical study suggests that vitamin D might improve pain in patients with fibromyalgia. A small clinical study in fibromyalgia patients with low vitamin D levels shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 1200-2400 IU daily seems to reduce pain, but not mood or quality of life, when compared with placebo ( 91349 ). more Food allergies. It is unclear if prenatal or infant oral vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of developing food allergies. A meta-analysis of two large clinical studies shows that prenatal or infant vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the risk of developing food allergies when compared with low-dose vitamin D or no intervention ( 108438 ). more Frailty. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of frailty in older adults. Frailty involves a combination of muscle loss and weakness, with exhaustion and reduced ability for physical activity. Some observational research has found that low vitamin D status is associated with frailty occurrence. However, clinical research in community dwelling older adults shows that taking vitamin D as 1000 IU, 2000 IU, or 4000 IU daily for 24 months does not prevent frailty or attenuate the worsening of frailty when compared with low-dose vitamin D 200 IU daily. Baseline vitamin D status did not affect these findings. Also, a sub-analysis suggests that vitamin D 2000 IU might increase frailty; however, only a small number of participants were randomized to this dose ( 109046 ). Other clinical research in community dwelling adults at least 70 years of age shows that taking cholecalciferol 2000 IU daily for 3 years does not reduce the odds of becoming pre-frail or frail over 36 months when compared with placebo. However, when taken in combination with omega-3 fatty acids 1 gram daily and a home exercise program, the odds of becoming pre-frail is reduced by 39% ( 110829 ). more Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). A small clinical study suggests that vitamin D may modestly improve anxiety in patients with GAD. A small clinical study in patients with GAD shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU once weekly for 3 months, in addition to taking an antidepressant and an anxiolytic, moderately reduces anxiety scores when compared with taking these medications alone ( 103654 ). more Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for improving outcomes in patients receiving HSCT. A small clinical study in patients who have undergone an autologous HSCT shows that taking calcitriol 0.25 mcg three times daily for 30 days can reduce the time to absolute lymphocyte count recovery, but does not affect time to recovery of absolute neutrophil and platelet counts, when compared with placebo ( 103665 ). more Hepatitis C. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with an inadequate response to hepatitis C therapy. Adding vitamin D to standard therapy for hepatitis C may improve viral response, especially in specific genotypes. A small clinical trial in patients with hepatitis C genotypes 2-3 receiving standard therapy with PEG-interferon and ribavirin shows that adding vitamin D 2000 IU daily for 24 weeks results in 95% of patients achieving undetectable levels of hepatitis C RNA, compared to only 77% of patients treated with standard therapy alone ( 98917 ). Another small clinical study in patients with hepatitis C genotype 1b receiving the same standard therapy shows that adding vitamin D 1000 IU daily for 16 weeks results in about 79% of patients achieving undetectable levels of hepatitis C RNA, compared to about 55% of patients treated with standard therapy alone. The TT genotype seems to be especially susceptible to vitamin D supplementation, while TG/GG genotype does not seem to be susceptible ( 98923 ). more HIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for improving bone mineral density (BMD) in children and young adults with HIV. Vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism are common in children and young adults with HIV. A meta-analysis of two clinical trials in this population shows that taking cholecalciferol for 12 months does not improve spine BMD when compared with placebo. Also, an analysis of two clinical trials shows that taking doses of 1600 IU to 4000 IU daily does not improve spine BMD when compared with taking doses of 400-800 IU daily. However, taking higher dose vitamin D has a small beneficial effect on total BMD when compared with taking lower doses. There was no improvement on parathyroid hormone levels ( 110824 ). This meta-analysis is limited by the availability of small clinical trials, as well as the heterogeneous doses of vitamin D used in the included studies. more Hyperlipidemia. Although population research has found that higher vitamin D levels are associated with improved lipid levels, it is unclear if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial. Clinical research results are conflicting. Population research has found that higher vitamin D levels are associated with lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels and higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels when compared with lower vitamin D levels ( 15630 , 98919 ). However, supplementation might not be beneficial. A meta-analysis of small clinical studies suggests that taking vitamin D as cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, alfacalcidol, or calcitriol slightly increases LDL cholesterol, but does not affect total cholesterol, triglycerides, or HDL cholesterol, when compared with placebo ( 84642 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the variability in patient populations, vitamin D dose and formulation, and study duration. Also, none of the included studies were prospectively designed to test the effect of vitamin D on lipid levels. Another meta-analysis of clinical studies in a mixed population of healthy adults and adults with metabolic disease shows that taking vitamin D 1400-50,000 IU weekly with calcium 500-2000 mg daily results in very modest improvements in total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol levels, but not LDL or very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses suggest that effects are more pronounced in people with metabolic disease ( 107227 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, which persisted throughout subgroup analyses. more Hyperthyroidism. Oral vitamin D has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Observational research suggests that serum vitamin D levels are decreased in patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease. A small preliminary clinical trial in patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease taking methimazole and low levels of selenium and vitamin D shows that taking vitamin D as cholecalciferol for 270 days, in combination with selenium for the first 180 days, modestly reduces levels of serum free thyroxine and improves quality of life when compared with no vitamin D or selenium. However, taking vitamin D and selenium did not affect levels of free triiodothyronine or positive thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibody ( 109049 ). more Hypothyroidism. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism. Preliminary clinical research in patients with vitamin D deficiency and subclinical hypothyroidism shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly for 2-12 weeks decreases mean thyroid stimulating hormone levels by about 20% when compared with placebo, or by 3.55 mIU/L when compared to baseline ( 107213 , 113589 ). more Ichthyosis. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with inherited ichthyosis. A small clinical study in patients with congenital non-syndromic ichthyosis shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily for 24 weeks reduces the clinical severity of disease at 12 weeks, but not 24 weeks, when compared with baseline. When compared with patients taking acitretin 0.5 mg/kg daily, results were similar at both 12 and 24 weeks, but it is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups ( 108441 ). more IgA vasculitis. It is unclear if oral alfacalcidol is beneficial in children with IgA vasculitis. A clinical study in children with IgA vasculitis shows that taking alfacalcidol 0.25 mcg daily along with vitamin C, rutin, dipyridamole, cimetidine, calcium, and glucocorticoids for 4 weeks improves rates of recurrence and incidence of kidney damage when compared with those receiving the same regimen without alfacalcidol. Alfacalcidol also improves cellular immune function and reduces levels of inflammatory biomarkers ( 107212 ). more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Taking vitamin D might slow prediabetes progression to diabetes in people with low baseline levels of vitamin D or in people achieving high levels of vitamin D following supplementation. It is unclear if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in people with prediabetes and sufficient vitamin D levels. Observational research has found that low vitamin D levels are linked with a higher risk of prediabetes and higher dietary vitamin D is linked with a lower chance of developing diabetes ( 84594 , 103669 ). Meta-analyses and individual clinical studies in patients with prediabetes and unclear or sufficient vitamin D levels show that vitamin D supplementation might improve some glycemic indices, but does not seem to prevent progression of prediabetes to diabetes ( 84594 , 91347 , 99769 , 108421 ). However, a more recent meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies designed to evaluate the preventative effects of oral vitamin D shows that taking it in the form of cholecalciferol 4000 IU daily or 20,000 IU weekly or eldecalcitol 0.75 mcg daily reduces the risk of developing diabetes with an absolute risk reduction of 3.3% over 3 years when compared with placebo. However, the actual risk reduction is highly dependent on vitamin D status. Patients achieving the highest serum vitamin D levels have absolute 3-year risk reductions of 11.4% to 18.1% ( 110810 ). In patients with vitamin D deficiency and prediabetes, vitamin D might improve beta-cell function, suggesting reduced disease progression ( 99768 , 107210 ). One clinical study in adults with vitamin D deficiency shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly for 3 months, and then monthly for 3 months, modestly improves insulin resistance and beta-cell function as measured by the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), but does not affect fasting or postprandial glucose levels when compared with placebo ( 99768 ). Further, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in patients with vitamin D deficiency and prediabetes shows that oral vitamin D at a median dose of 50,000 IU weekly for 26 weeks modestly improves fasting blood glucose and some markers of islet function, but not postprandial blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, when compared with control. Additionally, a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving vitamin D supplementation regressed from prediabetes to normal glucose status ( 107210 ). A meta-analysis of clinical studies in overweight or obese children and adolescents shows that high doses of vitamin D, 4000 IU daily or higher for 12-52 weeks, reduce HOMA-IR and C-reactive protein levels, but do not affect body weight, cholesterol, or parathyroid hormone ( 113596 ). A study in females with vitamin D deficiency and prediabetes shows that taking vitamin D 60,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 IU daily, has no effect on the incidence of type 2 diabetes at 2 years ( 107211 ). Clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, with moderate certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation in addition to lifestyle modification for adults with high-risk prediabetes to reduce the risk of progression to diabetes. Empiric vitamin D supplementation is defined as vitamin D from supplements or fortified food above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status ( 114502 ). more Infant development. It is unclear if giving oral vitamin D in doses above the recommended dietary allowance during infancy is beneficial for improving neurodevelopment. It is also unclear if oral vitamin D during pregnancy is beneficial for improving cognitive development in the offspring. Clinical research shows that giving vitamin D 1200 IU daily to healthy term infants of Northern European ethnicity starting at 2 weeks of age does not improve measures of neurodevelopment at 2 years of age when compared with giving the standard dose of vitamin D 400 IU ( 106121 ). Overall, the evidence from population research is mixed as to whether vitamin D status during gestation is associated with infant developmental outcomes. However, some population research has found that increased vitamin D status during pregnancy is associated with improved anthropomorphic and neurodevelopmental outcomes ( 104621 , 105724 ). Two meta-analyses of observational research show that low vitamin D status during pregnancy is associated with reduced head circumference and cognitive development scores, and higher odds of the offspring developing autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( 105724 , 105725 ). However, one meta-analysis suggests these risks may be limited to those with very low vitamin D status (serum level &lt; 12 ng/mL) ( 105724 ). Multiple meta-analyses show that vitamin D status during pregnancy does not appear to affect motor development ( 105724 , 105725 ). In one observational study, plasma vitamin D concentrations in the second trimester of pregnancy was associated with increased IQ scores in the offspring at age 4-6 years. Each 10 ng/mL increase in vitamin D levels was associated with a 1.17-point increase in IQ ( 104621 ). In contrast, clinical research shows that taking vitamin D3 2800 IU daily during the third trimester does not improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in the first 6 years of life when compared to taking lower doses of 400 IU daily ( 104623 ). more Infertility. It is unclear if oral or intramuscular vitamin D is beneficial in females with infertility. Observational research in females undergoing in vitro fertilization suggests no association between dietary vitamin D intake and oocyte quality, successful embryo transfer, clinical pregnancy rate, or term pregnancy rate ( 112097 ). Additionally, a meta-analysis of clinical research in females with infertility shows that, although there was no effect of taking vitamin D on implantation rate or miscarriage, taking vitamin D increases the odds of clinical pregnancy by 49% when compared with placebo. However, sub-analyses of clinical and observational research found that benefits on clinical pregnancy rates were limited to populations with vitamin D insufficiency, but not vitamin D deficiency, and for doses between 1000 to 10,000 IU daily for 30-90 days ( 110818 ). Most studies included in the analysis used oral vitamin D; however, intramuscular vitamin D was used in one cohort study. A smaller meta-analysis of clinical studies in females with infertility and vitamin D insufficiency undergoing IVF shows that taking vitamin D increases the rate of chemical pregnancy by 50%, but has no effect on the clinical pregnancy rate ( 108432 ). more Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for IBS; the available research is conflicting. Although some meta-analyses show that taking vitamin D is moderately more effective than placebo for improving IBS symptom severity and quality of life, other analyses disagree. Doses of vitamin D have included 50,000 IU weekly or every 2 weeks or 2000-4000 IU daily for up to 6 months ( 109041 , 109054 , 109057 ). The reasons for these discrepancies might be attributed to the inclusion criteria related to the individual trials, the small sample sizes, and varied dosing strategies used in the available research. more Kidney transplant. It is unclear if oral cholecalciferol is beneficial for improving allograft function or preventing non-skeletal complications in kidney transplant recipients. Following a kidney transplant, patients are at increased risk of vitamin D insufficiency and related outcomes. A large clinical trial shows that taking a high dose of cholecalciferol for 2 years does not reduce the composite risk of developing type 2 diabetes, major cardiovascular events, or cancer, or death when compared to taking a lower dose. The high and low doses of vitamin D were 100,000 IU or 12,000 IU, respectively, every 2 weeks for 2 months, followed by monthly doses for the next 22 months ( 110830 ). The effect of a high dose of vitamin D on these outcomes individually is not clear. However, taking vitamin D does not seem to improve allograft function. A clinical study in kidney transplant recipients shows that taking cholecalciferol 4000 IU daily, beginning 1-month posttransplant and continuing for 11 months, has no effect on allograft function when compared with placebo ( 108425 ). more Kidney transplant-related bone loss. Oral vitamin D might be beneficial for preventing bone loss associated with kidney transplantation. A large clinical trial shows that taking a high dose of cholecalciferol for 2 years modestly reduces the odds of a fracture by 76% when compared to taking a lower dose. The high and low doses of vitamin D were 100,000 IU or 12,000 IU, respectively, every 2 weeks for 2 months, followed by monthly doses for the next 22 months ( 110830 ). A prespecified secondary analysis of a clinical study in patients at 1-month post-kidney transplant from a living donor in Japan shows that taking vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 4000 IU daily for months 1-12 posttransplant reduces whole blood parathyroid hormone levels by 15%, but does not alter levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5-b or bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, when compared with placebo. The greatest effects on parathyroid hormone levels are observed in those with more severe vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and more preserved kidney function. Vitamin D supplementation also attenuates changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine, but not the distal radius, from prior to transplant. Patients taking vitamin D had a loss of only 0.2%, compared with a loss of 2% in those receiving placebo. The greatest effects are observed in those with osteoporosis or osteopenia ( 107220 ). Conversely, a small clinical trial shows that taking calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) 0.25 mcg daily in combination with calcium carbonate 500 mg daily does not decrease bone loss associated with kidney transplantation. However, calcitriol might reduce osteoclast suppression, help maintain trabecular bone volume and wall thickness, and improve axial BMD ( 4823 ). more Lichen planus. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for lichen planus. A small clinical study in patients with oral lichen planus and vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency shows that taking vitamin D 60,000 IU weekly in combination with systemic steroids for 1 month reduces pain severity and improves healing of lesions when compared with systemic steroids alone ( 114586 ). The validity of the study is limited by the lack of a placebo. more Low birth weight. It is unclear if oral vitamin D can reduce the risk for low birth weight; the available evidence is conflicting. A meta-analysis of observational research has found that a very low vitamin D status (serum level &lt;12 ng/mL) during pregnancy is associated with lower birth weight and increased odds of SGA births. However, these risks have not been demonstrated in those with less severe vitamin D deficiency (serum level &lt;20 ng/mL) ( 105724 ). Most research also shows that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy reduces the risk of low birth weight. A meta-analysis of three clinical trials shows that supplementation with vitamin D 800-1000 IU daily starting between 27 and 32 weeks' gestation, or 200,000 IU administered as a single dose or in two divided doses during the seventh and eighth month of pregnancy, reduces the risk of delivering a low birth weight infant by 60% ( 84659 ). Other meta-analyses of clinical research show that supplementation with vitamin D during pregnancy results in a 31% to 60% reduced risk of low birth weight and a 103 gram greater average birth weight when compared with placebo or no intervention ( 99766 , 114587 ). However, some meta-analyses show that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of low birth weight when compared with no supplementation ( 95910 , 109055 ). One meta-analysis that included studies that did not directly measure birth weight shows no effect of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on the rate of low birth weight, despite showing an increase in overall birth weight of about 58 grams ( 95910 ). more Lung cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin D prevents lung cancer or improves lung cancer prognosis. A small meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational research has found that high intake of vitamin D is associated with a 10% reduction in the risk of developing lung cancer when compared with low vitamin D intake. In terms of prognosis, high vitamin D intake is associated with improvements in both overall survival and relapse-free survival ( 107217 ). more Male infertility. It is unclear if oral cholecalciferol is beneficial in males with infertility. A small clinical study in males with infertility shows that taking cholecalciferol 2500 IU daily for 6 months modestly improves progressive sperm motility, sperm concentration, and sperm morphology when compared with baseline ( 108427 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Melanoma. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with melanoma. A meta-analysis of 14 observational studies suggests that vitamin D deficiency is associated with a 45% greater risk of melanoma when compared with normal vitamin D levels ( 112027 ). However, a small clinical study in patients with newly resected stage II melanoma shows that taking vitamin D3 100,000 IU every 50 days for 3 years does not improve disease-free survival when compared with placebo. Most patients in this study had vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency at baseline ( 106113 ). more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for preventing or treating metabolic syndrome. In patients with metabolic syndrome, clinical research shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly for 16 weeks does not affect most metabolic or anthropometric factors when compared with placebo, although there was a modest decrease in triglyceride levels ( 106123 ). However, almost all of the individuals in this study were vitamin D deficient or insufficient, and many remained in that category even after supplementation. It is unclear if vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in vitamin D sufficient patients with metabolic syndrome. There is conflicting evidence about the association between vitamin D and metabolic syndrome ( 14265 , 16713 , 98234 ). Some population research has found that higher vitamin D levels are associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome, while other research found no association ( 14265 , 16713 ). Furthermore, a small clinical trial in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking vitamin D 20,000 IU or 40,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks does not affect metabolic risk factors when compared with placebo ( 98234 ). more Migraine headache. It is unclear if oral vitamin D reduces the frequency of migraine. A meta-analysis of three small high-quality clinical studies in patients with migraine shows that taking vitamin D 2000 or 4000 IU daily for 12-24 weeks or 500,000 IU weekly for 2 months reduces the frequency of migraines by 2-3 attacks monthly when compared with usual care or placebo ( 108439 ). more Miscarriage. Oral vitamin D has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in pregnant adults with threatened miscarriage between the 6th and 13th week of gestation shows that taking a specific combination product (DAV HA, Lo.Li pharma s.r.l) containing vitamin D 50 mcg, alpha-lipoic acid, hyaluronic acid, magnesium, and vitamin B6 daily in combination with conventional treatment of vaginal progesterone over 2 weeks of observation results in a faster resorption of the subchorionic hematoma and faster decrease of patient-reported vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and uterine contractions when compared with vaginal progesterone alone ( 113893 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to vitamin D, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo for the control group. more Multiple sclerosis (MS). Although vitamin D supplementation has been linked with a lower risk of developing MS, taking oral vitamin D supplements does not seem to reduce MS relapses. Vitamin D deficiency appears to be linked to the risk of MS development and progression. Population research suggests that long-term supplementation with vitamin D 400 IU is associated with a 40% lower risk of MS in females. The effect seems to be dose-dependent. Consumption of at least 400 IU daily, mainly in the form of a multivitamin supplement, appears to have the greatest protective effect ( 11356 ). Additional population research in over 7 million people suggests that higher levels of calcifediol are associated with a lower risk of developing MS. In white adults, for every 20 ng/mL increase in vitamin D levels, there appears to be a 41% decrease in MS risk. However, this was not found in black and Hispanic adults ( 15159 ). Vitamin D supplementation has also been examined in patients with MS. Population research suggests that taking vitamin D supplements and the maintenance of optimal blood levels of vitamin D are associated with a reduction in the development of new areas of demyelination detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over 24 months. However, there are no correlations between vitamin D consumption or vitamin D blood levels and clinical outcomes ( 110816 ). Also, vitamin D supplementation does not seem to impact MS relapses or most symptoms in patients with MS. Meta-analyses of preliminary clinical research show that vitamin D supplementation does not affect the rate of MS relapses, overall symptoms, disability scores, or the number of MS nerve lesions detected by MRI, regardless whether the vitamin D was low-dose or high-dose ( 98192 , 98914 , 106119 , 113586 ). However, one meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies shows that taking vitamin D for 8-96 weeks slightly improves fatigue scores when compared with placebo ( 112024 ). These analyses are limited by the small size and heterogeneity of most of the included studies and variability in dosing and duration of vitamin D regimens. more Muscle strength. It is unclear if oral vitamin D improves muscle strength in middle aged or older adults with low or sufficient levels of vitamin D. The available research is conflicting. Clinical research in healthy older adults who are not deficient in vitamin D shows that oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation, with 800 IU, 1000 IU, or 2000 IU daily or 50,000 IU monthly, alone or in combination with a resistance training program, does not increase muscle strength when compared with placebo ( 11814 , 104619 , 108429 ). In patients 40-80 years of age with low vitamin D levels, taking vitamin D3 100,000 IU (2500 mcg) once, followed by 20,000 IU (500 mcg) weekly for 4 months, does not improve muscle strength when compared with placebo ( 103658 ). Similarly, meta-analyses of clinical research show that vitamin D does not increase grip strength, muscle mass, global muscle strength, or back extensor strength when compared with control ( 91341 , 113595 ). However, some research has found some benefit with the use of vitamin D supplements. One meta-analysis shows that taking vitamin D increases grip strength after menopause when compared with placebo or low-dose vitamin D, although a sub-analysis shows that beneficial effects are limited to individuals aged 60-69 years, when vitamin D is taken without calcium, when baseline vitamin D levels are at least 30 ng/mL, or when the treatment consists of the vitamin D analog alfacalcidol. This suggests heterogeneity between studies ( 109048 ). Another meta-analysis in elderly adults shows that taking vitamin D as calcifediol 10-30 mcg daily for a median of 24 weeks modestly improves hand grip strength and leg extension, but not leg flexion, when compared with baseline ( 109042 ). Also, some individual clinical research in older adults with low levels of vitamin D at baseline shows that taking vitamin D3 800 IU daily or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) 1000 IU daily for 12 months in combination with calcium 1000 mg daily modestly improves lower extremity or hip strength by 8% to 23% when compared with calcium alone ( 38915 , 84530 ). more Myalgia. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for reducing myalgia associated with obesity. Preliminary clinical research in obese individuals with vitamin D deficiency who are on a low-calorie diet shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly, alone or in combination with an aerobic exercise program three times weekly for 12 weeks, modestly reduces muscle pain when compared with only aerobic exercise three times weekly ( 106118 ). more Myelodysplastic syndromes. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. A small observational study in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes has found that taking calcitriol or calcifediol orally is associated with slowed disease progression ( 11825 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral or intramuscular vitamin D is beneficial in children or adults with NAFLD. Although findings from individual research are mixed, one meta-analysis of mainly small clinical trials in patients with NAFLD shows that vitamin D modestly improves insulin resistance and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, with no effect on serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Most studies included in the analysis used oral vitamin D 1000 IU daily or 50,000 IU weekly or biweekly for 3-6 months and compared with placebo; however, one study used a single intramuscular injection of vitamin D 600,000 IU compared with lifestyle modifications ( 109056 ). Vitamin D has also been evaluated in combination with fish oil. A clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking oral vitamin D3 1680 IU daily in combination with fish oil or fish oil alone for 3 months improves serum ALT levels similarly to a control group ( 107186 ). Vitamin D has also been evaluated for use in children with NAFLD. One clinical study in children with obesity and biopsy-proven NAFLD shows that taking oral vitamin D3 2000 IU daily for 6 months with a hypocaloric diet improves liver histopathology in terms of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and NAFLD activity score at 6 months, but not hepatocyte ballooning or fibrosis, when compared with baseline. These improvements were not seen in the group receiving placebo with a hypocaloric diet, but it is unclear if the improvement from baseline differed between groups ( 107222 ). more Nonmelanoma skin cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for preventing keratinocyte carcinomas. In middle aged and older adults recently diagnosed with a colorectal adenoma, clinical research shows that taking vitamin D3 1000 IU daily for 3-5 years does not reduce the incidence of keratinocyte cancer when compared with placebo over a median of 8 years. A sub-group analysis shows that taking vitamin D3 with calcium 1200 mg daily as calcium carbonate reduces the risk of invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma by a moderate amount, but has no effect on the risk of basal cell carcinoma. Vitamin D taken alone has no effect on the risk for either type of cancer ( 104622 ). more Obesity. The evidence for the use of oral vitamin D in obesity is conflicting and unclear. Population research has found that people with lower vitamin D levels are significantly more likely to be obese when compared to people with higher vitamin D levels ( 15630 ). Also, a large-scale, high-quality clinical trial in postmenopausal adults taking calcium 1000 mg plus vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 400 IU daily for 3 years shows that these patients are more likely to lose weight and maintain their weight when compared with those taking placebo. This beneficial effect is mainly seen in females who have inadequate intake of calcium, less than 1200 mg/day, before starting a calcium supplement ( 15604 ). However, other evidence suggests that vitamin D alone does not improve weight loss. One clinical trial shows that taking vitamin D3 2000 IU/day without calcium for 12 months does not increase weight loss when compared with placebo in overweight and obese postmenopausal adults who are deficient in vitamin D at baseline ( 91345 ). more Orthostatic hypotension. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for prevention of orthostatic hypotension. A secondary analysis of a clinical study in older patients with vitamin D insufficiency who are at an increased risk for falls shows that taking vitamin D 1000-4000 IU daily for up to 2 years has no effect on the risk of orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic symptoms when compared with those receiving vitamin D 200 IU daily ( 107223 ). more Osteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for osteoarthritis. The evidence for the use of vitamin D in osteoarthritis is conflicting. Some clinical research shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 2000 IU daily, or at a higher dose to reach serum vitamin D levels over 36 ng/mL, for 2 years does not reduce knee pain or loss of cartilage when compared with placebo in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis ( 84688 ). However, another clinical study shows that taking vitamin D3 daily for 10 days and then vitamin D3 60,000 IU monthly for 12 months modestly reduces pain and improves function when compared with placebo in patients with osteoarthritis and vitamin D insufficiency ( 98199 ). It is possible that higher doses of vitamin D have an effect on osteoarthritis, while lower doses do not. Due to this conflicting and low-quality evidence, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends against the use of vitamin D for any form of osteoarthritis ( 102114 ). more Otitis media. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with otitis media. The relationship between vitamin D status and otitis media is unclear. Population research has found that having otitis media is associated with lower blood levels of vitamin D; however, lower vitamin D levels were not associated with greater risk of otitis media ( 98194 ). more Overactive bladder. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for overactive bladder in children or adults. A large clinical trial in older males shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 2000 IU daily for 5 years does not reduce the odds of weekly overactive bladder when compared with placebo. In males with low baseline serum vitamin D, taking vitamin D reduces the odds of overactive bladder at 5 years by 49%, including 34% reduced odds of overactive bladder with urinary incontinence and 81% reduced odds of overactive bladder without incontinence. However, urinary incontinence while sleeping or napping was increased ( 109738 ). Vitamin D has also been evaluated for overactive bladder in children with low vitamin D levels. A large, single-blind clinical study in children with overactive bladder without urinary incontinence, and with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency, shows that taking vitamin D 2400 IU daily for 8 weeks with standard urotherapy reduces voiding frequency by about 3 or 4 voids daily when compared with standard urotherapy, with or without solifenacin 5 mg daily ( 115574 , 115591 ). Standard urotherapy was defined in this study as medical education, timed voiding, and pelvic floor muscle training. more Overall mortality. Taking oral vitamin D alone does not seem to reduce mortality; however, there is some evidence that taking certain forms of vitamin D with calcium might have a modest benefit. While higher vitamin D levels have been associated with a small reduction in mortality when compared with lower vitamin D levels ( 98187 ), clinical research shows that taking vitamin D does not reduce the risk of mortality. A comprehensive meta-analysis shows that vitamin D supplementation alone does not reduce all-cause mortality when compared to control ( 100900 ). However, giving vitamin D with calcium may modestly reduce the risk of mortality. Meta-analyses show a 4% to 9% reduced risk of mortality when trials of vitamin D alone and vitamin D with calcium are pooled together ( 16102 , 97296 , 98186 , 112022 ). Finally, some research suggests that the type of vitamin D supplementation might influence the results. A meta-analysis of clinical research found that vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) with or without calcium reduces mortality risk by 6%, while alfacalcidol, calcitriol, and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) do not have benefit ( 84595 , 98186 ). Other clinical research suggests that vitamin D supplementation in older adults may reduce the risk of all-cause mortality by about 4%, with an estimated effect size of 6 fewer deaths per 1000 individuals. This finding informed the 2024 Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines on vitamin D for the prevention of disease in the general population. The Endocrine Society conditionally recommends, with moderate certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from fortified foods or vitamin D-containing supplements in the general population aged 75 years and older to potentially lower the risk of mortality. Empiric vitamin D is defined as vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status. For empiric supplementation and for those who have indications for vitamin D treatment or supplementation, daily lower-dose versus intermittent higher doses was suggested ( 114502 ). more Pain (chronic). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for chronic pain. A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with chronic pain shows that taking vitamin D for 1-24 months produces a 43% greater decrease in pain score when compared with placebo. However, the final follow-up pain score is similar for both groups ( 96402 ). The effect of vitamin D on pain based on pain-related diagnosis, vitamin D status, or dose is unknown. more Parkinson disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for this condition. Population research found that higher levels of vitamin D are associated with milder Parkinson disease symptoms, while deficiency is associated with increased risk of Parkinson disease ( 97000 , 99772 ). One small study shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 1200 IU daily for one year might modestly slow the progression of Parkinson disease based on the Hoehn and Yars staging criteria. However, there was no improvement in disease severity according to the more widely used Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Stage (UPDRS). The UPDRS includes measures of activities of daily living and non-motor symptoms. Vitamin D had no effect on most quality of life measures ( 95915 ). more Periodontitis. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for periodontal disease. A meta-analysis of mostly observational research suggests that vitamin D levels are not associated with an increased or decreased risk of periodontitis ( 112026 ). Other population research suggests that higher blood levels of vitamin D may be associated with a reduced risk of periodontal disease in adults 50 years of age or older. However, this association was not found for adults younger than 50 years ( 15634 ). more Physical performance. It is unclear if oral vitamin D improves muscle strength in elderly adults. Some clinical research in healthy older adults who are not deficient in vitamin D shows that oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation, with 800 IU, 1000 IU, or 2000 IU daily or 50,000 IU monthly, alone or in combination with a resistance training program, does not improve physical performance when compared with placebo ( 11814 , 104619 , 108429 ). Also, results from one meta-analysis of clinical research in postmenopausal females with low levels of vitamin D shows that taking vitamin D does not improve the timed up and go test when compared with placebo or low-dose vitamin D ( 109048 ). One meta-analysis that included studies specifically evaluating the use of calcifediol in older adults shows a large benefit on gait speed; however, only one study included in the analysis used this endpoint and other measures of physical performance were not affected ( 109042 ). more Pneumonia. High-dose oral vitamin D does not reduce pneumonia severity in children. Although vitamin D supplementation might prevent respiratory tract infections in children, it might not prevent recurrent pneumonia. A small clinical study in children under 5 years of age with recurrent pneumonia and variable vitamin D blood levels shows that taking vitamin D 300,000 IU quarterly for 1 year does not reduce respiratory infections, severity of pneumonia, hospital admissions, or disease complications when compared with placebo ( 103667 ). However, it's unknown if vitamin D supplementation using lower and more frequent doses, or supplementation in patients with vitamin D deficiency, might be beneficial. Some observational research has found that having vitamin D deficiency is linked to a higher risk for developing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) ( 102118 ). For information on other respiratory infections, refer to the Respiratory Tract Infection discussion. more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if vitamin D improves pregnancy rates and outcomes, clinical symptoms, metabolic parameters, or hormone levels in patients with PCOS. Observational research in adults with infertility, PCOS, and insulin resistance suggests that normal vitamin D levels are associated with better embryo quality and increased pregnancy rate when compared with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency ( 100834 ). It is unclear if supplementation with vitamin D improves pregnancy rates in patients with PCOS. A meta-analysis of several mostly low-quality clinical studies in patients with PCOS and vitamin D deficiency at baseline shows that intramuscular or oral vitamin D 200-10,000 IU daily for up to 24 weeks in addition to fertility treatment improves pregnancy rates and reduces premature miscarriage and premature delivery, but does not impact the incidence of pregnancy complications including gestational hypertension or gestational diabetes, when compared with control. This analysis also suggests vitamin D supplementation improves certain IVF-related outcomes including ovulation rate, fertilization rate, and number of mature oocytes ( 112787 ). An earlier meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin D 400-12,000 IU daily for 2-6 months improves follicular development when compared with placebo. Taking vitamin D in combination with metformin 1500 mg daily also appears to increase the number of regular menstrual cycles by 85% when compared with metformin alone, but without an effect on follicular development ( 96404 ). However, a meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies shows that combining vitamin D with metformin probably does not improve menstrual cycle regulation when compared with metformin alone ( 113594 ). The effect of vitamin D on the hormonal and metabolic profiles of patients with PCOS has also been evaluated. An umbrella review of up to 15 meta-analyses of clinical studies in patients with PCOS shows that taking vitamin D 2000-8500 IU daily for 6.5-13.5 weeks reduces levels of serum triglycerides, total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and total testosterone, but not body mass index (BMI) or insulin levels, when compared with placebo ( 115577 ). A separate meta-analysis of 9 clinical studies, not included in the umbrella review, shows that combining vitamin D with metformin reduces insulin resistance, BMI, and testosterone levels when compared with metformin alone ( 113594 ). Additionally, a small clinical study in adults with PCOS and vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency shows that taking vitamin D 2000 IU daily in combination with diet and exercise for 12 weeks reduces insulin resistance, BMI, waist to hip ratio, serum triglyceride levels, and total and LDL cholesterol levels when compared with diet and exercise alone ( 114580 ). The interpretation of the results in this clinical study is limited by the lack of a placebo control. more Post-stroke fatigue. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for post-stroke fatigue. A retrospective study in patients with post-stroke fatigue and vitamin D deficiency suggests that vitamin D (cholecalciferol) 600 IU daily is associated with improvements in fatigue severity at months 1 and 3 when compared with control. Neurologic disability also showed improvement at 3 months, but not at 1 month, when compared with control. It is unclear if improvements from baseline differed between groups ( 107225 ). more Precocious puberty. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of precocious puberty. A meta-analysis of 43 mostly observational studies from China suggests that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is associated with 2.25-fold greater odds of precocious puberty when compared with normal vitamin D levels. Taking vitamin D 200-1000 IU daily for 3-12 months along with a gonadotropic-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) is associated with lower luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol levels and reduced bone age when compared with GnRHa therapy alone ( 112019 ). Another meta-analysis of 15 studies, mainly from China and with high heterogeneity and publication bias, suggests that there is a negative correlation between serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentrations and precocious puberty, and that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of precocious puberty by about 53% ( 113578 ). more Pre-eclampsia. It is unclear if oral vitamin D during pregnancy is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of pre-eclampsia. While some clinical research suggests that taking vitamin D during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia ( 113585 , 114587 ), clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, based on low certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from daily intake of fortified foods, vitamin D supplements, or prenatal vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D during pregnancy to potentially lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA) birth, and neonatal mortality. Empiric vitamin D supplementation is defined as supplementing with vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status ( 114502 ). more Pregnancy-induced hypertension. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for patients with gestational hypertension. Meta-analyses of two low-quality clinical trials show that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce the risk for gestational hypertension when compared with control ( 95910 , 114587 ). more Prematurity. It is unclear if taking vitamin D during pregnancy prevents respiratory complications in preterm neonates. A large clinical study in pregnant patients with gestational age less than 34 weeks and at risk of preterm delivery shows that a single intramuscular injection of vitamin D 50,000 IU within 72 hours before delivery decreases the risk of respiratory distress syndrome treated by surfactant in the neonate by about 2.25-fold and increases the 5th minute APGAR scores, but not 1st minute APGAR scores, gestational age, neonatal intensive care unit admission, length of hospital stay, or delivery method, when compared with no treatment ( 114581 ). more Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with PMS. Observational research has found that increasing dietary intake of vitamin D above 706 IU daily is linked to a reduced risk of developing PMS when compared with consuming 112 IU daily ( 13094 ). Furthermore, a clinical study shows that taking vitamin D 400 IU daily in combination with calcium 1000 mg daily can decrease the severity of PMS symptoms ( 16869 ). Another clinical study in adolescent females with PMS shows that taking vitamin D3 50,000 IU weekly for 9 weeks modestly reduces PMS symptoms when compared to baseline ( 98912 ). A small clinical study in young adults with PMS and vitamin D deficiency shows that taking vitamin D 50,000 IU every 2 weeks for 16 weeks reduces psychological symptom scores by 54% and physical symptom scores by 39% when compared with placebo ( 113582 ). more Preterm labor. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for preterm labor. Vitamin D deficiency, defined as serum levels less than 20 ng/mL, during pregnancy has been associated with a 25% greater risk of preterm birth ( 95911 ). The risk seems to be especially prominent in those with darker colored skin ( 103662 ). However, meta-analyses of clinical research show that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of a preterm birth when compared with no supplementation with vitamin D ( 84659 , 95910 , 109055 , 114587 ). The effect vitamin D specifically in vitamin D-deficient patients is still unclear. Some small, heterogeneous, and low-quality studies show that vitamin D supplementation might reduce the rate of preterm birth in vitamin D-deficient patients ( 84659 , 95910 ). Additional studies are needed to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of preterm birth. Clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, based on low certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from daily intake of fortified foods, vitamin D supplements, or prenatal vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D during pregnancy to potentially lower the risk of preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA) birth, preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, and neonatal mortality. Empiric vitamin D supplementation iss defined as supplementing with vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status ( 114502 ). more Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin D may not improve symptoms in patients with RA. Population research has found that higher intake of vitamin D from foods or supplements is associated with a lower risk of developing RA ( 12206 , 98200 ). However, a meta-analysis of two small clinical trials shows that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce pain or recurrence of RA when compared with placebo ( 98190 ). more Rhinosinusitis. Oral vitamin D has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients over 12 years of age with chronic sinusitis shows that taking 1 or 2 sachets of a specific combination product (Flogostop Forte, Humana Italia) containing vitamin D 600 IU, black currant, Boswellia serrata, and bromelain along with a nasal corticosteroid daily for 15-30 days reduces symptoms of nasal hyperemia and rhinorrhea when compared with corticosteroid nasal spray alone ( 111501 ). It is unclear if these findings are due to vitamin D, other ingredients, or the combination. more Sarcopenia. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in older adults with sarcopenia. A meta-analysis of randomized trials in older adults with sarcopenia shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 100-800 IU daily, with protein 10-44 grams daily or amino acids 2.5-6 grams daily, for 2-6 months moderately improves muscle strength, but not muscle mass or walking speed, when compared with placebo ( 105727 ). The validity of this study is limited by high heterogeneity and an unreported baseline vitamin D status. Similarly, a small network meta-analysis of randomized trials shows that taking vitamin D 500-1600 IU daily or 2500-5000 IU weekly with protein 20-80 grams daily or amino acids 3-32 grams daily with and without exercise for 3-18 months increases hand grip strength and shortens time to chair-stand, respectively, but not gait speed or lower-limb mass when compared with usual care ( 107221 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to vitamin D, protein/amino acid supplementation, exercise, or the combinations. more Schizophrenia. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for schizophrenia. Based on preliminary clinical evidence, Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that vitamin D in doses of 1500 to 4000 IU daily is not recommended for adjunctive use in patients with schizophrenia ( 110318 ). A moderate-sized clinical study in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking a specific combination product (BioZenD, Tak Gen Zist Pharmaceutical Company) containing vitamin D 400 IU in combination with a blend of probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, Limosilactobacillus reuteri, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Bifidobacterium longum, Bacillus coagulans) 2 x 10 9 CFU daily for 12 weeks improves cognitive function scores but does not improve the severity of positive and negative schizophrenia symptoms when compared with placebo ( 114582 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin D, the probiotics, or the combination. more Sciatica. Oral vitamin D has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary research in adults up to 45 years of age with discogenic sciatica shows that taking cholecalciferol 800 IU with alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, and resveratrol daily for 30 days, in combination with a 20-session rehabilitation protocol, improves pain, disability, and quality of life when compared with the supplements alone or the rehabilitation protocol alone ( 112933 ). more Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). One small study suggests that a large dose of oral vitamin D can improve symptoms of SAD. A small clinical study in patients with SAD suggests that a single dose of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) 100,000 IU improves symptoms after one month when compared to baseline ( 83791 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. more Seborrheic keratosis. It is unclear if topical vitamin D analogues improve symptoms of seborrheic keratosis. Preliminary clinical research suggests that topical ointments containing activated vitamin D in the form of tacalcitol, calcipotriol or maxacalcitol, applied for 3-12 months, can reduce tumor volume by at least 40% in 75% of patients with seborrheic keratosis. Additionally, over 30% of patients seem to experience complete tumor resolution or a reduction in tumor volume of at least 80% ( 84033 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. more Sexual dysfunction. One small study suggests that injecting a large dose of vitamin D might improve sexual function. A small clinical study in females with vitamin D deficiency and sexual dysfunction shows that receiving an intramuscular injection of vitamin D as cholecalciferol 300,000 IU once at baseline and a second time 4 weeks later improves sexual function at 4 and 8 weeks when compared with placebo ( 100896 ). more Sickle cell disease. One small study suggests that oral vitamin D reduces pain and improves quality of life in children with sickle cell disease with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. A small clinical study in children with sickle cell disease shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 40,000-100,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks reduces days with pain and improves physical activity and quality of life for up to 6 months when compared with placebo. Of the children included in the study, 82.5% had vitamin D insufficiency, while 52.5% were deficient in vitamin D ( 98918 ). It is unclear if vitamin D is effective for patients with sickle cell disease who have adequate levels of vitamin D. more Small for gestational age (SGA). It is unclear if oral vitamin D can reduce the risk for SGA births; the available evidence is conflicting. Two meta-analyses of clinical research show no effect of vitamin D on the risk of SGA birth ( 84659 , 109055 ). However, one meta-analysis shows a 40% reduction in the risk of SGA births with vitamin D supplementation ( 95910 ). Also, one meta-analysis shows that when vitamin D supplementation is initiated before the 20 th week of gestation, the risk of SGA is reduced by 54% ( 109055 ). Most individual clinical trials are small and heterogeneous. Also, the formulation of vitamin D and/or vitamin D status at baseline may explain part of the discrepant findings. For example, a meta-analysis of observational research has found that a very low vitamin D status (serum level &lt;12 ng/mL) during pregnancy is associated with increased odds of SGA births. This association does not seem to be present with less severe vitamin D deficiency (serum level &lt;20 ng/mL) ( 105724 ). Clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society conditionally recommend, with low certainty of evidence, empiric vitamin D supplementation from daily intake of fortified foods, vitamin D supplements, or prenatal vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D during pregnancy to potentially lower the risk of SGA births, as well as preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, and neonatal mortality. Empiric vitamin D supplementation is defined as supplementing with vitamin D above the Recommended Dietary Allowance without having tested serum vitamin D status ( 114502 ). more Statin-induced myalgia. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for patients with statin-induced myalgia. Observational research has found that taking oral vitamin D supplements is associated with decreased symptoms of myalgia in patients taking statin drugs. In a small case series, patients who discontinued statins due to myalgia were able to resume statin therapy after starting vitamin D supplements. The majority of patients with myalgia were found to be vitamin D deficient, with vitamin D levels less than 12 ng/mL at baseline ( 16829 ). An observational study has also found that administering 50,000 units of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) once a week for 12 weeks reversed symptoms of myalgia in 92% of statin treated patients with low serum vitamin D levels of less than 32 ng/mL ( 16831 ). more Stroke. Although low vitamin D levels are associated with higher risk of stroke, taking vitamin D supplements does not seem to reduce stroke risk. Population research has found that low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of stroke. Furthermore, increased dietary intake of vitamin D is associated with a reduced risk of stroke ( 15630 , 16618 , 93944 , 97303 , 106106 ). However, clinical research shows that vitamin D supplementation does not reduce stroke risk. Several meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials show that taking vitamin D alone or with calcium does not reduce the risk of stroke in patients with or without cardiovascular disease risk factors ( 16616 , 91343 , 97296 , 97308 , 106106 , 112022 ). It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from these studies, as they did not assess whether patients had adequate vitamin D levels at baseline. It is unclear if vitamin D supplementation might prevent strokes in patients with vitamin D deficiency. more Sunburn. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin D for the treatment of sunburns, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin D for this purpose. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with SLE. While some observational research has found that adults with SLE are more likely to have vitamin D deficiency than healthy controls ( 102119 ), a small cross-sectional study in females has found no association between serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, SLE disease activity, and the presence or absence of lupus nephritis ( 107214 ). A meta-analysis of three small clinical studies shows that taking vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 2000 IU daily or 50,000 IU weekly seems to reduce anti-dsDNA positive, a marker of disease activity, when compared with placebo in patients with SLE ( 98190 ). However, the clinical significance of this finding is unclear. A small clinical trial in females with SLE shows that taking vitamin D3 5000 IU daily for 12 weeks modestly improves overall disease activity, but not quality of life, when compared with placebo ( 109735 ). more Thyroid cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with thyroid cancer. Observational research in patients undergoing thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer suggests that taking vitamin D daily for at least 6 months after surgery is associated with a 38% lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 33% lower risk of total cancer-related mortality when compared with no vitamin D supplementation at around 10 years' follow-up. However, vitamin D does not appear to be linked to a lower risk of thyroid cancer-related mortality in these patients ( 112018 ). more Ulcerative colitis. Limited evidence suggests that vitamin D may be beneficial in patients with ulcerative colitis. A meta-analysis of mainly small clinical trials in patients treated with mesalazine shows that taking vitamin D for up to 24 weeks modestly increases clinical efficacy and reduces disease score when compared with mesalazine alone ( 109044 ). Also, a meta-analysis of small, low-quality clinical studies in patients with IBD, including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, shows that taking high- or low-dose vitamin D for up to 1 year reduces the rate of relapse when compared with control ( 98915 ). These findings are limited because of the heterogeneity of the included studies. more Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for dementia. A large clinical trial shows that taking vitamin D 2800 IU daily, starting at gestational week 24 and continuing until one week after birth, reduces the risk of the child developing croup by 3 years of age by 40% when compared with olive oil as placebo. This risk reduction did not change after adjusting for the use of omega-3 fatty acids 2.4 grams daily, as well as for concomitant persistent wheeze and/or lower respiratory tract infections ( 109304 ). more Urinary incontinence. Limited evidence suggests that vitamin D may be beneficial in middle-aged, but not older, adults with urinary incontinence. Clinical research in middle-aged premenopausal females with stress urinary incontinence and low vitamin D status shows that taking vitamin D 5000 IU once weekly for 12 weeks has a moderate to large beneficial effect on the severity of incontinence and quality of life when compared with placebo. Kegel exercises were performed by all participants ( 109736 ). However, vitamin D supplementation does not seem to be beneficial for reducing urinary incontinence in older adults. In older females and males, a large clinical trial shows that vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 2000 IU daily for 5 years does not reduce the incidence or progression of urinary incontinence when compared with placebo ( 109738 , 109741 ). In older males with low vitamin D status, vitamin D supplementation may actually increase some types of incontinence ( 109738 ). more Urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the prevention of UTIs in children. A meta-analysis of 13 small observational studies in children suggests that lower levels of vitamin D are associated with 2.8-fold greater odds of UTI when compared with higher vitamin D levels. Further, this analysis shows that vitamin D deficiency in children is linked to 5.5-fold greater odds of UTI when compared with normal vitamin D levels ( 112030 ). more Urticaria. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of urticaria. A meta-analysis of population research has found that having urticaria is associated with a slightly lower vitamin D blood level and a greater likelihood of vitamin D deficiency when compared with individuals without urticaria. In addition, a meta-analysis of 6 clinical trials shows that taking vitamin D at an average daily dose of at least 4100 IU has a modest effect on the severity of urticaria symptoms ( 106115 ). Pooled data from 2 clinical studies in adults with chronic urticaria shows that taking vitamin D for 12 weeks, either as cholecalciferol 60,000 IU every 2 weeks or as alfacalcidol, 0.25 mcg once daily, reduces pruritus severity when compared with placebo ( 115587 ). more Uterine fibroids. Low vitamin D status is associated with uterine fibroids and some clinical research suggests that taking vitamin D may modestly decrease the size of uterine fibroids. Two meta-analyses of 5 clinical studies in premenopausal adults with uterine fibroids shows that taking vitamin D, either 50,000 IU weekly or biweekly for 8-12 weeks or 1000 IU daily for 1 year, decreases fibroid size when compared with placebo or no treatment ( 113577 , 115573 ). One of the meta-analyses found a 5.7% difference in fibroid size between vitamin D and control ( 115573 ). Observational research also suggests that vitamin D status is associated with uterine fibroids. Specifically, meta-analyses of a total 23 observational studies suggest that individuals with uterine fibroids have lower serum vitamin D levels and a 3.7-times higher odds of vitamin D deficiency ( 115573 ). more Vaginal atrophy. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial for vaginal atrophy. There is limited evidence on the topical use of vitamin D in vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal adults or patients taking tamoxifen. A small cross-sectional study in postmenopausal adults has found that taking a vitamin D supplement for at least one year improves the maturation index of superficial vaginal wall cells when compared with those who do not take vitamin D. However, symptoms of vaginal atrophy were not different between groups ( 16879 ). Vitamin D has also been evaluated for vaginal atrophy due to tamoxifen. A small clinical trial in females with breast cancer using tamoxifen shows that receiving vitamin D 1000 IU vaginal suppositories daily for 8 weeks improves maturation index of vaginal walls and self-reported symptoms when compared with placebo ( 99773 ). more Vertigo. It is unclear if oral vitamin D is beneficial in patients with vertigo. An analysis of observational research suggests that lower serum levels of vitamin D are associated with a higher risk of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) when compared with higher vitamin D levels ( 114579 ). However, it is unclear if vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of BPPV in individuals with low vitamin D levels. Vitamin D has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for the treatment of BPPV. A large clinical study in adults with recurrent BPPV shows that taking vitamin D 400 IU and calcium 500 mg twice daily for one year reduces the risk of recurrence by 27% when compared with no treatment. The number needed to treat to prevent vertigo was 4 ( 103681 ). It is unclear if this benefit is due to vitamin D, calcium, or the combination. more Vitiligo. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin D for vitiligo, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin D for this condition. Warts. Although there is interest in using topical vitamin D derivatives for warts, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin D for this condition. More evidence is needed to rate vitamin D for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally or intramuscularly and appropriately. Vitamin D has been safely used in a wide range of doses ( 7555 , 16888 , 16891 , 17476 , 95913 , 98186 , 104619 , 105209 , 109040 , 109059 )( 115580 , 115590 ). When used orally long-term, doses should not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily for adults ( 17506 , 99773 ); however, much higher doses such as 50,000 IU (1250 mcg) weekly orally for 6-12 weeks are often needed for the short-term treatment of vitamin D deficiency ( 16891 , 17476 , 115590 ). Monthly oral doses of up to 60,000 IU (1500 mcg) have also been safely used for up to 5 years ( 105726 ). Toxicity usually does not occur until plasma levels exceed 150 ng/mL ( 17476 ). Possibly Unsafe when used orally in excessive doses, long-term. Taking doses greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily for adults for long periods can increase the risk of hypercalcemia ( 17506 ); however, much higher doses are often needed for short-term treatment of vitamin D deficiency. Toxicity typically occurs when levels exceed 150 ng/mL ( 17476 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. When used long-term, doses should not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1000 IU (25 mcg) daily for those 0-6 months of age, 1500 IU (37.5 mcg) daily for those 6-12 months of age, 2500 IU (62.5 mcg) daily for those 1-3 years of age, 3000 IU (75 mcg) daily for those 4-8 years of age, and 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily for those 9 years and older ( 17506 ); however, much higher doses are often needed for the short-term treatment of vitamin D deficiency. Some research shows that giving vitamin D 14,000 IU (350 mcg) weekly for a year in children aged 10-17 years is safe ( 16875 ). A meta-analysis of clinical studies shows that 1000 IU (25 mcg) daily in those up to a year of age and greater than 2000 IU (50 mcg) daily in those aged 1-6 years does not increase the risk of serious adverse events ( 108424 ). CHILDREN: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in excessive doses for longer than one year. Taking doses greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) long-term can increase the risk of hypercalcemia ( 17506 ). PREGNANCY: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Vitamin D is safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily ( 17506 , 95910 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in excessive amounts. Tell patients not to use doses above the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily. Hypercalcemia during pregnancy due to excessive vitamin D intake can lead to several fetal adverse effects, including suppression of parathyroid hormone, hypocalcemia, tetany, seizures, aortic valve stenosis, retinopathy, and mental and/or physical developmental delay ( 17506 ). LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Vitamin D is safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily ( 17506 ). LACTATION: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in excessive amounts. Tell patients not to use doses above the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily ( 17506 ).</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: General : The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that supplement labels list vitamin D content in units of micrograms (mcg). To convert from International Units (IU) to mcg, divide the IUs by a factor of 40. To convert from mcg to IUs, multiply the mcg amount by a factor of 40 ( 98237 ). The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin D based on age is 600 IU (15 mcg) daily in those 1-70 years of age and 800 IU (20 mcg) daily in those 71 years and older. For those pregnant or lactating, the RDA is 600 IU (15 mcg) daily ( 17506 ). The National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends vitamin D 400-800 IU (10-20 mcg) daily for adults under age 50, and 800-1000 IU (20-25 mcg) daily for older adults ( 16120 ). The current RDA assumes that vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) are equivalent; however, some evidence indicates that vitamin D2 is less than one-third as potent as vitamin D3 and that vitamin D3 is more effective in improving vitamin D status ( 15263 , 15264 , 107228 ). Therefore, many experts now recommend using vitamin D supplements containing vitamin D3 in order to meet these intake levels ( 15263 , 15264 ). Recommendations for supplemental vitamin D doses vary greatly. In general, patients should not exceed the tolerable upper limit of 4000 IU daily, unless advised by a healthcare provider. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Advise patients that vitamin D can be taken with or without food. When consumed with a low-fat meal, absorption of vitamin D is up to 20% higher than when consumed with a high-fat meal or no meal. However, this increased absorption does not correlate with a sustained increase in serum vitamin D levels ( 97302 ). Topical: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Children Oral: The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is as follows: 1-18 years of age, 600 IU (15 mcg) daily; pregnant and lactating girls, 600 IU (15 mcg) daily. For infants ages 0-12 months, an adequate intake (AI) level of 400 IU (10 mcg) is recommended ( 17506 ). Avoid doses above the tolerable upper limit (UL), unless recommended by a healthcare provider. The ULs for children are as follows: 1000 IU (25 mcg) daily for those 0-6 months of age, 1500 IU (37.5 mcg) daily for those 6-12 months of age, 2500 IU (62.5 mcg) daily for those 1-3 years of age, 3000 IU (75 mcg) daily for those 4-8 years of age, and 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily for those 9 years and older ( 17506 ). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. The American Academy of Pediatrics increased the recommended minimum daily intake of vitamin D to 400 IU (10 mcg) daily for all infants and children, including adolescents ( 16614 ). Advise parents not to use vitamin D liquids dosed as 400 IU (10 mcg) per drop. Giving one dropperful or mL by mistake can deliver 10,000 IU (250 mcg) daily. Standardization &amp; Formulation Vitamin D used in clinical research has included oral, topical, and injectable formulations. Also, inactivated, activated, and synthetic forms of vitamin D have been used in clinical research. Inactivated or unmetabolized forms of vitamin D have included cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) ( 11819 , 11820 , 11821 ). Activated forms of vitamin D have included alfacalcidol, calcitriol, and calcifediol ( 11818 , 11821 , 11823 , 39045 , 83933 , 83955 ). Synthetic or man-made forms of vitamin D have included dihydrotachysterol, calcipotriene, maxacalcitol, and paricalcitol ( 11818 , 11820 , 11822 , 84325 ). Some specific oral vitamin D products used in clinical research include Hydroferol (Lab Juventus), a brand of calcifediol ( 11825 ); and Rocaltrol (Roche SA), a brand of calcitriol ( 11825 ). In one clinical trial, oral vitamin D was administered via gravity-metered dropper bottles to deliver a consistent dosage (Ddrops Co, Woodbridge, ON, Canada) ( 91340 ). Topically, vitamin D has been used in clinical research alone or in combination with corticosteroids. Daivobet/Dovobet, a specific product used in clinical research, contains calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate ( 22283 ). In a survey of 67 multivitamins available in England for children ages 12 years and younger, 25% to 36% of the multivitamins provided at least 400 IU vitamin D daily. About 57% to 67% of multivitamins with a claim involving 'healthy bones' contained at least vitamin D 400 IU ( 98924 ).</data><data key="interactions_text">Expand All | Collapse All ALUMINUM Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Vitamin D might increase aluminum absorption and toxicity, but this has only been reported in people with renal failure. The protein that transports calcium across the intestinal wall can also bind and transport aluminum. This protein is stimulated by vitamin D, which may therefore increase aluminum absorption ( 11595 , 11597 , 22916 ). This mechanism may contribute to increased aluminum levels and toxicity in people with renal failure, when they take vitamin D and aluminum-containing phosphate binders chronically ( 11529 , 11596 , 11597 ). more ATORVASTATIN (Lipitor) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Vitamin D might reduce absorption of atorvastatin. A small, low-quality clinical study shows that taking vitamin D reduces levels of atorvastatin and its active metabolites by up to 55%. However, while atorvastatin levels decreased, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels did not substantially change ( 16828 ). Atorvastatin is metabolized in the gut by CYP3A4 enzymes, and researchers theorized that vitamin D might induce CYP3A4, causing reduced levels of atorvastatin. However, this proposed mechanism was not specifically studied. more CALCIPOTRIENE (Dovonex) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Taking calcipotriene with vitamin D increases the risk for hypercalcemia. Calcipotriene is a vitamin D analog used topically for psoriasis. It can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to cause systemic effects, including hypercalcemia ( 15 ). Theoretically, combining calcipotriene with vitamin D supplements might increase the risk of hypercalcemia. more CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Vitamin D might induce CYP3A4 enzymes and reduce the bioavailability of CYP3A4 substrates. There is some concern that vitamin D might induce CYP3A4. In vitro research suggests that vitamin D induces CYP3A4 transcription. Additionally, observational research has found that increased UV light exposure and serum vitamin D levels are associated with decreased serum levels of CYP3A4 substrates such as tacrolimus and sirolimus, while no association between UV light exposure or vitamin D levels and levels of mycophenolic acid, a non-CYP3A4 substrate, was found ( 110539 ). A small, low-quality clinical study shows that taking vitamin D reduces levels of the CYP3A4 substrate atorvastatin and its active metabolites by up to 55%; however, the clinical effects of atorvastatin were not reduced ( 16828 ). While researchers theorized that vitamin D might induce CYP3A4, this proposed mechanism was not specifically studied. more DIGOXIN (Lanoxin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, hypercalcemia induced by high-dose vitamin D can increase the risk of arrhythmia from digoxin. High doses of vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia increases the risk of fatal cardiac arrhythmias with digoxin ( 15 ). Avoid vitamin D doses above the tolerable upper intake level (4000 IU daily for adults) and monitor serum calcium levels in people taking vitamin D and digoxin concurrently. more DILTIAZEM (Cardizem, others) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, hypercalcemia induced by high-dose vitamin D can reduce the therapeutic effects of diltiazem for arrhythmia. High doses of vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can reduce the effectiveness of verapamil in atrial fibrillation ( 10574 ). Theoretically this could also occur with diltiazem. Avoid vitamin D doses above the tolerable upper intake level (4000 IU daily for adults) and monitor serum calcium levels in people taking vitamin D and diltiazem concurrently. more THIAZIDE DIURETICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, taking thiazide diuretics and high-dose vitamin D can increase the risk of hypercalcemia. Thiazide diuretics decrease urinary calcium excretion, which could lead to hypercalcemia if vitamin D supplements are taken concurrently ( 3072 , 11541 , 69580 ). This has been reported in people being treated with vitamin D for hypoparathyroidism, and also in elderly people with normal parathyroid function who were taking a thiazide, vitamin D, and calcium-containing antacids daily ( 11539 , 11540 ). more VERAPAMIL (Calan, others) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Hypercalcemia induced by high-dose vitamin D can reduce the therapeutic effects of verapamil for arrhythmia. Hypercalcemia due to high doses of vitamin D can reduce the effectiveness of verapamil in atrial fibrillation ( 10574 ). Avoid vitamin D doses above the tolerable upper intake level (4000 IU daily for adults) and monitor serum calcium levels in people taking vitamin D and verapamil concurrently. more</data><data key="name">Vitamin D</data><data key="scientific_name">1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, Alfacalcidol, Calcifediol, Calcipotriene, Calcitriol, Cholecalciferol, Dihydrotachysterol, Ergocalciferol, Paricalcitol</data><data key="overview_text">Vitamin D is an essential fat-soluble vitamin. There are several forms of vitamin D, including ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Both ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol are metabolized in the body to calcitriol, the active metabolite. Commercially available vitamin D3 supplements are usually made from animal sources such as lanolin, though a vegan source of D3 made from lichen is available. Vitamin D2 supplements are primarily plant-based. Vitamin D is found in dietary sources, such as fish, eggs, and fortified milk. It is also made in the skin during brief exposure to sunlight. In the US, foods containing at least 120 IU vitamin D are allowed to state that adequate calcium and vitamin D as part of a well-balanced diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.</data></node>

Vitamin E refers to eight different forms including alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherols and four tocotrienols. Most vitamin E in foods is gamma-tocopherol while most supplements contain alpha-tocopherol, which has the highest bioavailability and is used to set dietary requirements ( 107858 ). Unlike most nutrients, vitamin E does not appear to have a specific role in a required metabolic process. The major function of vitamin E is probably that of a chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents the formation of free radicals. Vitamin E's therapeutic benefits have primarily been attributed to its antioxidant effects ( 4844 , 12494 , 13501 , 30898 ). Alpha-tocopherol is the most active form in humans. Although biological activity of other forms is significantly less and current guidelines do not include forms of vitamin E other than alpha-tocopherol for meeting dietary requirements ( 4844 ), the other forms, such as gamma-tocopherol and the tocotrienols, have been associated with some pharmacological activity. For example, gamma-tocopherol appears to decrease the programmed death of human coronary artery endothelial cells. There is some concern that high doses of vitamin E might have a pro-oxidant rather than an antioxidant effect ( 12495 , 13036 , 16823 ). Alpha-tocopherol-mediated peroxidation (TMP) occurs in vitro, but whether this occurs in vivo isn't clear ( 13504 ). High doses of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) alone might disrupt the normal antioxidant balance and decrease the effect of other vitamin E isomers such as gamma-tocopherol and other antioxidants ( 12496 , 13036 ). In early pregnancy, this imbalance may adversely affect uteroplacental tissues, affect development of placenta-related disease, and embryogenesis ( 16823 ). Analgesic effects Vitamin E is thought to reduce pain by decreasing the production of prostaglandins via prevention of phospholipid peroxidation and arachidonic acid release ( 99367 ). Anti-dementia effects Vitamin E has been studied for its ability to slow the progression of Alzheimer disease, possibly due to an interaction with free radicals and a disruption of cellular damage ( 11472 ). Preliminary data suggest vitamin E might improve cognitive function by decreasing beta-amyloid damage ( 4637 , 4638 , 4639 ). Anti-diabetic effects Vitamin E might be beneficial in diabetes. Population research shows that higher vitamin E intake is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes ( 14004 ). Some clinical research shows that taking vitamin E improves glucose disposal in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 4726 ). However, vitamin E supplementation does not seem to affect insulin resistance measured by the homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, and only improves glycemic parameters in patients with diabetes that also have low vitamin E levels at baseline ( 13496 , 90095 , 90099 , 98259 ). Anti-inflammatory effects A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with various conditions shows that taking vitamin E seems to modestly lower inflammatory markers, such as serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, when compared with control ( 104406 ). A meta-analysis of 11 trials in patients on hemodialysis shows that taking vitamin E, typically in a dose of 400 IU daily for 2-20 weeks, decreases markers of endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation, including intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and markers of systemic inflammation including CRP, when compared with placebo or no treatment. There was no effect on IL-6 ( 107863 ). Antineoplastic effects Increased vitamin E intake has been associated with a reduced risk of various cancers such as renal cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and many others ( 3360 , 90083 , 98262 ). Theoretically, vitamin E reduces oxidative damage, which is associated with the development of cancers ( 5882 ). Several mechanisms have been theorized for reducing carcinogenesis, including the neutralization of reactive oxygen species, the inhibition of the formation of nitrosamines, and enhancement of immune function ( 9839 , 98262 ). Preliminary evidence also shows that vitamin E and other antioxidants can decrease oxidative damage associated with tumor-directed radio-immunotherapy ( 5882 ). Vitamin E is used for photo-aged skin and to prevent oxidative skin damage related to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (e.g., sunburn) due to its antioxidant effects. However, some researchers think that this benefit requires concomitant use with other antioxidants such as vitamin C to prevent degradation of vitamin E ( 6062 , 6064 ). Chemotherapy and radiation therapy also adversely affect vitamin E status ( 98 ). Vitamin E inhibits protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in several cell types, including smooth muscle, platelets, and monocytes ( 4844 ). Preliminary research suggests that vitamin E might have an antiproliferative effect on benign hyperplastic prostate cells ( 11235 ). Population studies suggest an association between low serum levels of alpha-tocopherol and higher risk of prostate cancer ( 12874 ). In vitro research suggests that gamma-tocopherol, the primary vitamin E form in food, inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells, but alpha-tocopherol has no effect ( 4089 , 13503 ). This inhibitory effect of vitamin E on prostate cancer cells might be due to its antiandrogen activity ( 12875 , 12876 ). RRR-alpha-tocopheryl succinate, known as vitamin E succinate (VES), is currently being researched for its chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive potential. VES has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth, primarily by triggering apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma ( 3361 ). There is some evidence that the inhibitory effect on cancer cell growth by statin drugs with a closed ring structure, such as mevastatin and lovastatin (Mevacor), may be enhanced when used with alpha tocopheryl succinate ( 8046 ). Apolipoprotein effects A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that oral alpha-tocopherol in doses of 100-1200 IU daily does not have a significant effect on apolipoproteins A1 or B100 ( 107860 ). Cardiovascular effects Oxidative damage has been attributed to many conditions for which vitamin E is used, including lipid peroxidation in heart disease ( 6204 ). Some preliminary research suggests that vitamin E might inhibit the local inflammatory process and oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is associated with atherosclerosis ( 97 , 249 ), but when this theory was tested in healthy adults without heart disease, RRR-alpha-tocopherol, even at 2000 IU/day, did not produce markers that indicate a reduction in lipid oxidation ( 13159 ). It also does not appear to reduce levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation that is associated with cardiovascular disease, when used in combination with vitamin C and alpha-lipoic acid ( 14010 , 85129 ). This appears to be another case where promising laboratory data turns out to be clinically irrelevant. Vitamin E also doesn't appear to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation in older adults with hypercholesterolemia ( 11286 ). The tocotrienols from rice and barley bran might lower total cholesterol and LDL, possibly by decreasing activity of HMG CoA reductase, but in a different way than "statin" drugs ( 3237 , 3238 , 3239 , 3240 , 3241 ). Tocotrienols might also be capable of decreasing carotid artery plaque size in some people, possibly by decreasing platelet aggregation ( 3239 ). Vitamin E might also lower the protective high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. This potential pro-oxidant effect could result in adverse cardiovascular outcomes ( 13036 ). Gamma-tocopherol appears to prolong prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times and has caused hemorrhage in experimental animals ( 4098 ). Beta- and delta-tocopherol have also been shown to prolong prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times in laboratory animals ( 4098 ). Large amounts of vitamin E interfere with vitamin K-dependent clotting factor production, producing hypoprothrombinemic effects, especially in people with vitamin K deficiency or those who are taking oral anticoagulants ( 3073 , 3074 ). Mixed tocopherols seem to have a greater effect on platelet aggregation than alpha-tocopherol alone, which might explain the discrepancy between the effects of dietary vitamin E intake and supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) in cardiovascular disease. Mixed tocopherols seem to increase nitric oxide (NO) release and superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein content in platelets, which may contribute to the effect on platelet aggregation ( 10364 ). Central nervous system (CNS) effects In tardive dyskinesia, it is thought that some patients may have increased dopamine turnover resulting in increased production of free radicals and structural damage. The antioxidant effects of vitamin E may reduce the number of free radicals that increase dopamine turnover. Additionally, people with tardive dyskinesia may have decreased levels of vitamin E and vitamin C ( 3598 ). Also, in the treatment of epilepsy, vitamin E is primarily used because some patients taking anti-epileptic drugs have decreased blood levels of vitamin E. Vitamin E might also act as a membrane stabilizer and enzyme repressor in these patients ( 3356 , 6066 ). Deficiency Vitamin E deficiency is rare and most typically seen in genetic abnormalities that prevent maintenance of normal blood concentrations of vitamin E or conditions that prevent absorption. Vitamin E deficiency does not cause specific disease in adults, although creatinuria, ceroid deposition, muscle weakness, and decreased erythrocyte survival are associated with low serum vitamin E concentrations. In adults, total body stores of vitamin E, found in adipose tissue, have been estimated to be 3-8 grams and are sufficient to meet the body's requirements for 4 or more years of a deficient diet. In premature infants, vitamin E deficiency can cause irritability, edema, thrombosis, and hemolytic anemia ( 15 ). Some evidence links asthma to increased oxidative stress and vitamin E deficiency. Epidemiological and case-control studies have associated asthma with lower vitamin E intake, lower vitamin E serum levels, lower vitamin E levels in lung lining fluid, and maternal vitamin E intake during pregnancy ( 315 , 401 , 409 , 422 , 6058 , 15006 ). But clinical studies using vitamin E for asthma have not been performed. Vitamin E might also work by non-antioxidant mechanisms. Preliminary research suggests that it affects cellular signaling and modifies gene expression in cerebellar cells involved in the regulation of coordinated movement. Cerebellar ataxia is a symptom of vitamin E deficiency ( 13505 ). Immunomodulating effects Vitamin E may play a role in allergic reactions. Lower vitamin E serum levels have also been associated with higher IgE levels and positive allergen skin tests ( 5275 ). For immune function in the elderly, vitamin E supplementation might replenish an inapparent deficiency. Deficiency of vitamin E and other micronutrients are common in apparently well-nourished people over age 90 and might affect the number and function of natural killer cells in old age ( 4688 ). Most research suggests that vitamin E supplementation in healthy elderly people improves response to delayed-type hypersensitivity skin testing (DTH), an indicator of immune function, and antibody response to hepatitis B, tetanus and diphtheria, and pneumococcal vaccines ( 4676 , 4689 , 4690 , 4691 ). But whether vitamin E supplementation results in better health in elderly people is unknown. Neuroprotective effects Small clinical studies in patients with diabetes show that taking a specific tocotrienol-rich vitamin E supplement (Tocovid SupraBio, Hovid Nutriworld) for up to 1 year seems to modestly increase nerve conduction velocity when compared with placebo ( 104427 , 107388 ). Renal effects Some researchers think the antioxidant activity of vitamin E may slow progression of renal disease. Oxidative metabolites may accumulate in renal dysfunction. Vitamin E could theoretically slow the rate of decline in chronic inflammatory kidney diseases such as IgA nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and glomerulosclerosis; and poisoning by nephrotoxic drugs and other compounds ( 10369 ). Furthermore, there has been some speculation that vitamin E intake might reduce the risk of renal cell carcinoma. Some population research shows that vitamin E intake is associated with a reduced risk of kidney cancer or renal cell carcinoma ( 98262 ).</data><data key="general_safety">Likely Safe</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Vitamin%20E</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Effective Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED). Oral vitamin E is effective for treating vitamin E deficiency due to the genetic disorder AVED. This genetic disorder occurs when the gene that produces alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) is defective. This causes severe vitamin E deficiency. Symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, absence of deep tendon reflexes, and sensory loss usually appear between 4 and 18 years of age. Vitamin E supplements are used in the treatment of AVED ( 13498 , 101437 , 101438 ). more Vitamin E deficiency. Oral vitamin E is effective for preventing or treating vitamin E deficiency and associated conditions. Taking vitamin E orally is effective for preventing and treating vitamin E deficiency ( 4844 ). However, vitamin E deficiency is rare in humans. It most commonly occurs in people with malabsorption disorders such as abetalipoproteinemia; cystic fibrosis; gastrectomy; hepatic-biliary tract disease including chronic cholestasis, hepatic cirrhosis, biliary atresia, and obstructive jaundice; in infants receiving formula with insufficient vitamin E; intestinal diseases including celiac and tropical sprue; and regional enteritis ( 4844 , 104411 ). more Possibly Effective Alzheimer disease. Oral vitamin E might slow functional decline in some patients with this condition. However, it does not seem to prevent Alzheimer disease onset. A clinical study in patients with moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 2000 IU daily for 2 years might be similar to selegiline (Eldepryl), and superior to placebo, for slowing cognitive decline. Benefit was only apparent when outcomes were adjusted for baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. This study is limited by attrition bias, or incomplete outcome reporting ( 4635 , 97070 ). Another clinical study in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol 2000 IU daily reduces the annual rate of decline in activities of daily living by 19% when compared with placebo. This translates to a delay in disease progression of 6.2 months. This is comparable to the effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., rivastigmine) in this population. Despite these positive findings, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends against the use of vitamin E for the management of dementia due to the increased risk for adverse effects with the extended use of high-dose vitamin E ( 104823 ). Interestingly, the combination of vitamin E and memantine (Namenda) 20 mg per day is not superior to placebo in this population. Researchers speculate that this lack of effectiveness may be due to an interaction between vitamin E and memantine, but this proposed interaction has not been validated in research ( 19060 , 97070 ). Vitamin E supplementation doesn't seem to prevent Alzheimer disease or slow progression of mild cognitive impairment. Patients with mild cognitive impairment who take vitamin E 2000 IU daily for 3 years progress to Alzheimer disease at the same rate as those who take placebo ( 13060 , 97070 ). Furthermore, although population research has found that greater intake of foods high in vitamin E is associated with a lower risk of developing Alzheimer disease ( 34597 , 90082 ), taking vitamin E supplements does not seem to help. Evidence from a large clinical study that was later converted into an observational study shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU orally daily does not prevent Alzheimer disease when compared with placebo in cognitively intact men ( 93570 ). However, this study is limited by the fact that the participants were well-educated and were assessed for dementia in their 60s; the prevalence of dementia is typically low in this age group ( 93571 ). more Beta-thalassemia. Oral vitamin E seems to be beneficial for children with this condition. A small clinical study in children with beta-thalassemia and low vitamin E plasma concentrations shows that taking vitamin E orally seems to correct erythrocyte membrane abnormalities when compared with control ( 4642 ). Another small clinical trial in children 5-18 years of age with beta-thalassemia shows that taking an age-based dose of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 200-600 mg daily for 4 weeks seems to increase haptoglobin levels, suggesting reduced hemolysis, when compared with placebo ( 104412 ). more Dysmenorrhea. Oral vitamin E seems to reduce pain in adults with dysmenorrhea. Small clinical studies in younger adults with primary dysmenorrhea show that taking vitamin E 200-500 IU daily, starting 2 days before menstruation and continuing through the first 3 days of bleeding for 2-4 cycles, decreases the severity and duration of pain and reduces blood loss when compared with placebo ( 10361 , 14432 , 99367 ). One study also shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU with fish oil provides better pain relief when compared with taking either vitamin E or omega-3 fatty acids alone ( 99367 ). A meta-analysis of 8 small clinical studies, including those described above, in individuals with dysmenorrhea shows that taking vitamin E reduces the severity of pain when compared with placebo ( 112170 ). more Exercise-induced muscle damage. Oral vitamin E seems to modestly reduce exercise-induced muscle damage. A meta-analysis of 17 very small clinical studies in trained and untrained adults shows that taking vitamin E 300-1200 IU daily for up to 12 weeks reduces markers of exercise-induced muscle damage, including creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, when compared with placebo. Vitamin E appears to be most beneficial in athletes and at doses under 500 IU daily ( 112160 ). However, a small clinical study in endurance-trained runners, not included in the analysis above, shows that taking vitamin E (as alpha-tocopherol) 235 mg and vitamin C 1000 mg 2 hours prior to an exercise protocol does not reduce delayed onset muscle soreness or improve markers of exercise-induced muscle damage when compared with placebo ( 109961 ). more Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Oral vitamin E seems to be beneficial in patients with G6PD deficiency. Individual clinical studies evaluating the use of vitamin E in patients with G6PD deficiency show mixed results ( 4682 , 4683 , 4684 ). However, a meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies in patients with G6PD deficiency shows that taking vitamin E improves hemoglobin levels and reduces reticulocyte levels when compared with placebo in the setting of both acute and chronic hemolysis ( 112164 ). more Intracranial hemorrhage. Oral vitamin E might reduce the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants. Clinical research shows that giving premature neonates vitamin E orally might reduce the risk of intracranial hemorrhage when compared with control ( 4655 , 85074 ). more Intraventricular hemorrhage. Oral vitamin E might reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants. Intravenous vitamin E does not provide this benefit. A meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that oral, but not intravenous, administration of vitamin E can reduce the risk for intraventricular hemorrhage in premature neonates when compared with control. However, it might not reduce the risk for severe (grade III-IV) intraventricular hemorrhage. Additionally, high serum levels of vitamin E have been associated with an increased risk for sepsis in premature infants ( 85062 ). more Nitrate tolerance. Oral vitamin E might reduce tolerance to nitrates. Nitrate tolerance might involve increased vascular superoxide anion production, and antioxidants may help prevent this ( 4705 ). Clinical research in patients with ischemic heart disease shows that taking vitamin E 447-894 IU daily can help prevent nitrate tolerance when compared with placebo ( 4705 , 11543 ). more Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Oral vitamin E seems to improve outcomes in patients with NASH. Clinical studies and meta-analyses in adults with NASH shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU daily for up to 24 months improves liver enzymes, hepatic fibrosis, steatosis, and lobular inflammation ( 14005 , 17517 , 97077 , 104413 ). Taking vitamin E 400-1200 IU in children with NASH also seems to improve liver enzyme levels after 4-10 months of treatment ( 89 ). Furthermore, a small study in patients with NASH shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU daily for 1 year seems to improve liver histology to a similar degree as taking telmisartan 40 mg daily ( 104405 ). In fact, practice guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommend taking vitamin E 800 IU daily as a first-line therapy in non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH. However, vitamin E isn't recommended in NASH patients with diabetes, cirrhosis, or cryptogenic cirrhosis ( 98130 ). more Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Oral vitamin E seems to improve PMS symptoms. Clinical research in adults with PMS shows that taking vitamin E 400-600 IU daily for 3 cycles reduce subjective reports of symptoms, including anxiety, craving, and depression, when compared with placebo ( 4719 , 4720 ). Another small clinical study in Japanese patients with PMS shows that taking vitamin E, as gamma-tocopherol 180 mg, twice daily for 7 days during the luteal phase of 2 consecutive cycles reduces fatigue, irritability, and leg swelling when compared with placebo ( 112337 ). more Tardive dyskinesia. Oral vitamin E might attenuate worsening of tardive dyskinesia in patients taking antipsychotic medications. Small clinical studies suggest that taking vitamin E orally improves Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores in patients with tardive dyskinesia. It seems to be more effective in higher doses and in people who have had tardive dyskinesia for less than 5 years ( 3942 , 3943 , 3944 , 3945 , 3946 , 3948 , 85323 ). Both RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) and unspecified forms were used in clinical trials. However, some conflicting findings have been reported. A meta-analysis suggests that vitamin E does not improve symptoms of tardive dyskinesia when compared with placebo; however, taking vitamin E seems to prevent the deterioration of symptoms when compared with placebo ( 97079 ). more Possibly Ineffective Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral vitamin E does not seem to slow AMD progression. Results from clinical trials and meta-analyses of clinical trials show that vitamin E when taken alone or in combination with other antioxidants does not prevent the development ( 4667 , 7303 , 7304 , 34625 ) or progression of AMD ( 34633 ). In contrast, taking vitamin E 400 IU orally with elemental zinc 80 mg, vitamin C 500 mg, and beta-carotene 15 mg daily does seem to be beneficial. When taken for 5 years, this combination reduces visual acuity loss and reduces the risk of progression of AMD by 25% in patients with advanced AMD ( 7303 , 11326 ). A 10-year follow-up on this study confirmed these findings ( 90069 ). It is not known if this combination is beneficial for people with less advanced macular disease or for preventing AMD. Additionally, it is not clear if this benefit is due to vitamin E, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Oral vitamin E does not seem to slow ALS progression. Clinical research in patients with ALS shows that taking alpha-tocopherol 1490 IU daily for up to 12 months in addition to riluzole does not influence survival or motor function when compared with riluzole alone. However, these patients seem to be less likely to progress to a more severe disease state from a milder disease state ( 83180 ). Additionally, a large population study has found that dietary intake of vitamin E is not associated with risk of developing ALS ( 90087 ). more Angina. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce angina symptoms. Clinical research shows that taking vitamin E orally may have some effect on endothelial dysfunction, but does not improve angina in nonsmokers or smokers, when compared with placebo ( 3896 , 4634 , 4649 , 4650 , 4651 , 4652 ). more Atherosclerosis. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce atherosclerosis progression. Taking RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) orally does not appear to have any effect on atherosclerosis progression or mortality in patients with atherosclerosis when compared with placebo ( 3899 , 3936 ). However, there is preliminary evidence that a combination of vitamin E and vitamin C might help prevent the progression of atherosclerosis in men, particularly smokers and cardiac transplant patients ( 1918 ). more Atopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce eczema symptoms. Clinical research shows that taking vitamin E 600 IU in combination with selenium daily for 12 weeks does not improve symptoms of atopic eczema when compared with placebo or selenium alone ( 74456 ). Also, while some clinical research shows that taking 600 IU of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) daily for 60 days with vitamin D 1600 IU improves overall atopic dermatitis symptoms, pruritus, and erythema when compared with placebo, taking vitamin E alone does not seem to have this effect. However, vitamin E alone does improve hard, leathery skin symptoms and dryness when compared with placebo ( 84491 ). more Breast cancer-related hot flashes. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce hot flashes related to breast cancer. Clinical research shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU daily for 4 weeks does not reduce hot flashes in females who have had breast cancer when compared with placebo ( 454 ). more Bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. Clinical research in premature infants weighing less than 1500 grams at birth shows that taking vitamin E orally does not prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia when compared with placebo ( 4657 , 85062 ). more Cataracts. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce cataract risk. Some population research has found that dietary and supplemental vitamin E intake is associated with a reduced risk of developing age-related cataracts ( 4208 , 4663 , 4665 , 4759 ). However, other population research has not found this association ( 2395 , 4664 , 92902 ). Additionally, higher quality evidence from clinical trials and a meta-analysis consistently shows that vitamin E, taken alone or with other vitamins, does not prevent the progression of age-related cataracts or decrease vision loss when compared with control ( 4666 , 7304 , 34626 ). However, a meta-analysis of observational research suggests that higher dietary intake of vitamin E is weakly associated with a 27% reduction in the odds of developing cataracts when compared with low dietary intake of vitamin E ( 112095 ). more Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy. Although some small, low-quality clinical studies and a meta-analysis of these studies suggest that vitamin E 600 mg daily for 3 months might be beneficial for preventing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy induced by cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin when compared with placebo ( 10366 , 85117 , 90072 ), these studies have found no effect with lower doses of vitamin E or in those receiving paclitaxel chemotherapy ( 107862 ). In addition to the low methodological quality of the studies, the validity of these finding is limited by high heterogeneity, as the studies included patients with several different cancer types. Also, a large, high-quality clinical study shows that taking vitamin E 400 mg daily is not beneficial for preventing peripheral neuropathy induced by taxanes or platinum analogues when compared with placebo ( 101457 ). The American Society of Clinical Oncology does not recommend the use of vitamin E for the prevention or management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( 101434 ). more Colorectal cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce colorectal cancer risk. Some population research has found that intake of vitamin E and multivitamins is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer ( 1047 ). Some preliminary clinical research also shows that taking vitamin E orally in combination with other vitamins might have a protective effect in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas ( 3954 , 3956 , 92903 ). However, higher quality evidence from larger clinical trials and meta-analyses of clinical research consistently show that taking vitamin E supplements alone, or in combination with other vitamins, does not prevent colorectal cancer incidence or recurrence when compared with control ( 3953 , 3955 , 3957 , 12185 , 13036 , 13131 , 34594 , 90361 ). Despite this conflicting research, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim in 2009 regarding vitamin E and colorectal cancer risk. However, the FDA has determined that it is highly unlikely that vitamin E supplements reduce the risk of colorectal cancer ( 102332 ). more Congestive heart failure (CHF). Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce CHF symptoms or prevent CHF development. Clinical research in adults with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV heart failure shows that taking vitamin E (RRR- α tocopherol) 500 IU orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve prognostic or functional indices of CHF or quality of life measurements when compared with placebo ( 3906 ). Additionally, population research shows that taking vitamin E 600 IU every other day does not affect the risk of developing heart failure in healthy females 45 years or older when compared with placebo ( 90068 ). more Head and neck cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of head and neck cancer recurrence. In fact, it might increase recurrence risk. A large clinical trial in patients with stage I or II head and neck cancer shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 400 IU daily, during radiation therapy and for 3 years after the end of radiation therapy, does not reduce the risk of recurrence of the first tumor or development of a second primary tumor when compared with placebo. In fact, there is some concern that patients taking vitamin E seem to have an increased risk of tumor recurrence or a second primary tumor when compared with patients taking placebo ( 13055 ). Advise patients with head and neck cancer to avoid taking vitamin E supplements in doses of 400 IU/day or more. more Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Oral vitamin E during pregnancy does not seem to reduce IUGR risk. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E along with other ingredients throughout pregnancy does not reduce the risk for IUGR when compared with placebo ( 97075 ). more Liver disease. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce liver disease-associated mortality. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E does not reduce all-cause-or liver related-mortality or morbidity in patients with liver diseases, including autoimmune liver diseases, viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis ( 34608 ). Additional clinical research in male smokers over 50 years old shows that taking vitamin E 75 IU orally, alone or with beta-carotene 20 mg orally, daily for 5-8 years does not reduce the risk of mortality due to chronic liver disease when compared with placebo ( 91383 ). more Oral leukoplakia. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk for oral leukoplakia in male smokers. Although there is some conflicting evidence ( 3951 , 4708 ), the largest randomized controlled trial indicates that supplementation with all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 55.6 IU daily for 5-7 years has no effect on the incidence of oral lesions in male cigarette smokers when compared with placebo ( 3951 ). more Osteoarthritis. Oral vitamin E does not seem to be beneficial for osteoarthritis treatment or prevention. Taking vitamin E 500 IU daily for 6 months does not seem to decrease symptoms of pain or stiffness in patients with osteoarthritis when compared with placebo ( 5264 ). Additional clinical research show that taking vitamin E 500 IU daily for up to 2 years does not slow cartilage loss when compared with placebo ( 13066 ). Population research has shown that taking vitamin E supplements does not reduce the risk of developing osteoarthritis or slow the progression of existing osteoarthritis ( 5881 ). more Pancreatic cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce pancreatic cancer risk. Taking vitamin E supplements alone or in combination with other antioxidants such as beta-carotene and vitamin C does not reduce the risk of developing pancreatic cancer ( 12185 , 85147 ). Taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 55.6 IU daily for 5 to 8 years also does not seem to reduce the incidence of or mortality from carcinoma of the pancreas in male smokers ( 3961 ). more Parkinson disease. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce Parkinson disease symptoms or progression, although the risk of developing the disease may decrease with increased dietary vitamin E intake. Observational research has found that dietary vitamin E intake might be associated with a decreased occurrence of Parkinson disease ( 4712 ). A meta-analysis of 12 studies evaluating the risk of developing Parkinson disease has found that the highest daily intake of vitamin E is associated with a 20% lower risk than those with the lowest intake ( 107858 ). However, clinical research in patients with stage I or II Parkinson disease shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 2000 IU daily for up to 24 months doesn't seem to have any benefit when compared with baseline or control ( 4709 , 4710 , 4711 , 85318 ). more Pharyngeal cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces the risk of developing cancer of the pharynx. A sub-group analysis of a large-scale clinical trial (The HOPE Trial) in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease suggests that taking RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 400 IU daily for about 7 years is not linked with a reduced risk of developing oral or pharyngeal cancer when compared with placebo ( 13036 ). more Pre-eclampsia. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce pre-eclampsia risk. The majority of clinical research shows that taking a combination of vitamins E and C, at the same doses, does not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia in low-, moderate-, or high-risk patients, when compared with placebo or no treatment. Also, the risk of gestational hypertension might increase in some cases, although results are inconsistent ( 83312 , 83356 , 83383 , 83472 , 83474 , 97075 , 97059 ). Other researchers using vitamin E in combination with vitamin C and allopurinol beginning at 24-32 weeks gestation found the combination similar to placebo ( 4718 ). However, some clinical research suggests that taking a combination of vitamin E 400 IU and vitamin C 1000 mg daily reduces the risk of proteinuric hypertension in high-risk patients when started in weeks 16-22 of pregnancy ( 3236 ). more Preterm labor. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce risk for premature labor. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E along with other ingredients throughout pregnancy does not reduce the risk for preterm labor when compared with placebo ( 97075 ). more Prostate cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. A meta-analysis of over 30 large clinical trials and observational studies shows that neither dietary nor supplemental vitamin E reduces the risk of prostate cancer when compared with a control ( 112159 ). However, individual study results are mixed. Population research on the use of dietary or supplemental vitamin E intake for prostate cancer risk reduction is conflicting ( 12872 , 14124 , 12873 , 15607 ). Although one large-scale study in smokers found that taking 55.6 IU daily of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) reduced the risk of prostate cancer and mortality ( 3959 , 11303 ), most large-scale randomized, controlled trials show that vitamin E is not beneficial. A sub-group analysis of a large-scale clinical study (The HOPE trial) in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease suggests that taking 400 IU of RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) daily for about 7 years is not linked with a decreased risk of developing prostate cancer when compared with placebo ( 13036 ). Another large scale study (Physician's Health Study II) shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU every other day for an average of 8 years does not reduce the risk of prostate cancer when compared with placebo ( 16708 , 90097 ). Similarly, another large clinical study (The SU.VI.MAX study) shows that a combination of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 44.7 IU, vitamin C 120 mg, beta-carotene 6 mg, selenium 100 mcg, and zinc 20 mg daily for an average of 8 years does not reduce the risk of prostate cancer overall when compared with placebo ( 14135 ). A fourth large-scale clinical trial (The SELECT trial) in men over the age of 50 years shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 400 IU daily, alone or in combination with selenium 200 mcg daily, for an average of about 5.5 years does not reduce prostate cancer risk when compared with placebo ( 16707 ). Also, an extension of this initial study found that taking vitamin E alone was associated with a 17% increased of developing prostate cancer ( 17688 ). more Respiratory tract infections. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce respiratory infections in most patients. However, there's some evidence that it might reduce incidence of the common cold in patients living in long-term care facilities. Taking oral vitamin E 298 IU daily, alone or in supplemental multivitamin form, does not appear to decrease the incidence, duration, or severity of upper or lower respiratory infections in elderly persons when compared with placebo ( 10788 , 12094 ). However, some research shows that taking vitamin E reduces the incidence of the common cold in elderly long-term care patients when compared with placebo ( 12094 ). More evidence is needed to determine how effective vitamin E might be for reducing the incidence of the common cold. more Retinitis pigmentosa. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce retinitis pigmentosa and related visual decline. Taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) orally does not appear to slow visual decline is people with retinitis pigmentosa and has been associated with more rapid loss of visual acuity, although the validity of the study with these findings has been questioned ( 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 ). more Scarring. Topical vitamin E does not seem to improve scar appearance. Some clinical research shows that applying ointment containing vitamin E topically does not reduce surgical wound scarring when compared with a placebo ointment ( 4721 , 4722 ). more Stillbirth. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce risk of a stillborn baby. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E along with other ingredients during pregnancy does not reduce the risk for stillbirth when compared with placebo ( 97075 ). more Likely Ineffective Breast cancer. Oral vitamin E does not reduce breast cancer risk. Some evidence suggests that higher serum levels of vitamin E might be associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer ( 10132 ). However, increasing vitamin E intake from the diet or supplements does not seem to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer ( 4658 , 4659 , 85147 , 112334 ). Also, a large-scale randomized trial in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease shows that patients who take 400 IU of RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) daily do not have a reduced risk of developing breast cancer ( 13036 ). In other large-scale studies, females who take RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 600 IU every other day for up to 10 years also do not have a lower risk of developing breast cancer ( 13131 , 34580 ). more Cancer. Oral vitamin E does not reduce the risk of cancer in most patients. Some research suggests that a combination of vitamin E 44.7 IU daily with vitamin C, beta-carotene, selenium, and zinc does not lower the overall risk of cancer, although it might reduce the risk of cancer when only males are evaluated ( 14109 ). However, clinical research from a large scale study (Physician's Health Study II) shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU every other day for an average of 8 years does not reduce the overall risk of cancer in males when compared with placebo ( 16708 , 90097 ). Also, clinical research published in a meta-analysis shows that taking vitamin E does not reduce the overall risk of cancer ( 85147 ). In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding antioxidant vitamins, such as vitamin E and overall cancer risk. However, the FDA has determined that the evidence is limited and inconclusive ( 102334 ). The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) states that there is no net benefit to supplementation with vitamin E for the prevention of cancer in general and therefore recommends against its use ( 108641 , 112166 ). more Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most evidence shows that oral vitamin E does not reduce the risk for CVD events or complications. Most clinical research in various populations shows that taking vitamin E supplements orally is not effective for preventing heart disease or adverse cardiovascular outcomes such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, hospitalizations for unstable angina, morbidity, or cardiovascular death ( 12492 , 12493 , 13036 , 14108 , 66140 , 83050 , 85084 , 85224 ). The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) states that there is no net benefit to supplementation with vitamin E for the prevention of CVD in general and therefore recommends against its use ( 108641 , 112166 ). With few exceptions ( 3357 , 3936 ), large-scale controlled clinical trials show that vitamin E supplements offer no benefit for primary prevention in healthy or high-risk patients ( 3907 , 3935 , 3937 , 13036 , 13131 ), or for secondary prevention of heart disease and cardiovascular events such as MI, stroke, and death ( 3896 , 3899 , 13036 ). While one analysis of clinical research found that in mostly healthy patients 70 years or younger without CVD, vitamin E supplementation reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality, the authors performed more than 20 statistical tests and did not adjust for multiple comparisons. Therefore, it possible that the positive effect was due to chance. This analysis was also limited because it excluded adults older than 70 years of age and adults that are more likely to suffer an exacerbation from a chronic condition. Furthermore, the analysis showed that vitamin E supplementation does not reduce the risk of all-cause mortality or the risk of CVD compared with placebo or no intervention ( 97078 ). There's additional conflicting evidence. One large-scale trial shows that healthy females who take RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 600 IU every other day for up to 10 years also do not have a lower risk of major cardiovascular events but might have a 24% lower risk of cardiovascular death when compared with placebo ( 13131 ). This finding is contradictory to previous findings. One notable limitation of this trial is a lack of systematic assessment of the use of statins or other cardiovascular therapies by the participants throughout the 10-year period. Meta-analyses of clinical trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes and the haptoglobin 2-2 genotype show that taking vitamin E, up to 600 IU daily for up to 8 years, reduces the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction and death due to CVD ( 85179 , 85221 ). Because these meta-analyses included only specific patients, the generalizability of the results is questionable. There is debate about whether some forms of vitamin E might work differently than others. Some people suggest that RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) is more effective than all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E). This has not been verified by studies. A meta-analysis of vitamin E studies indicates that there is no significant difference in cardiovascular outcomes based on the form of vitamin E used ( 13132 ). The FDA has refused to allow labeling claims for vitamin E supplements for prevention of CVD ( 3939 ). A Science Advisory from the American Heart Association also states that the evidence doesn't justify use of antioxidants such as vitamin E for reducing the risk of CVD ( 12142 ). Advise patients not to rely on vitamin E supplements for preventing heart disease. more Fetal and premature infant mortality. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce death in preterm infants. Meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking vitamin E throughout pregnancy does not affect morbidity or mortality in preterm infants when compared with placebo ( 85074 , 97075 ). more Fibrocystic breast disease. Oral vitamin E does not improve fibrocystic breast disease in most patients. Clinical research shows that taking alpha-tocopherol 150 IU, 300 IU, or 600 IU daily for 2-3 months does not improve subjective or objective measures of fibrocystic breast disease when compared with placebo ( 4660 , 4661 , 4662 ). more Lung cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce lung cancer risk. Taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 55.6 IU daily for 5-8 years is not associated with a lower risk of developing lung cancer for male smokers ( 3949 ). A sub-group analysis of a large scale clinical trial in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease who take RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 400 IU daily for about 7 years do not have a lower risk of developing lung cancer when compared with placebo ( 13036 ). In another large-scale study, females who take RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 600 IU every other day for up to 10 years also do not have a lower risk of developing lung cancer ( 13131 ). Meta-analyses of clinical research suggest taking vitamin E as alpha-tocopherol for up to approximately 10 years does not prevent lung cancer or reduce the incidence of lung cancer mortality when compared with placebo ( 34632 , 85147 ). However, a large epidemiological cancer screening trial with a mean follow-up of over 12 years suggests that higher dietary intake of vitamin E, but not total intake or supplementation with vitamin E, is associated with a modest reduction in development of lung cancer ( 112096 ). more Overall mortality. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of mortality from all causes. Although some population research suggests that increased dietary vitamin E intake is associated with reduced overall mortality ( 98260 ), most meta-analyses of clinical research in adults show that taking vitamin E supplements for at least 1 year does not affect all-cause mortality ( 34622 , 85164 , 85200 ). Furthermore, when only high quality clinical trials were analyzed, mortality was increased by 3% in adults taking vitamin E when compared with control ( 34622 ). more Prematurity. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of premature birth and complications. Clinical research shows that vitamin E does not improve blood parameters or prevent the development of anemia in premature infants ( 4648 , 10362 ). One clinical study in premature infants weighing less than 1500 grams at birth shows that giving vitamin E 25 IU daily for six weeks does not improve hemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte counts, or platelet counts when compared with placebo ( 4648 ). Another clinical study in premature infants weighing less than 1250 grams at birth shows that giving vitamin E 50 IU daily for eight weeks does not increase the response to erythropoietin and iron when compared with placebo ( 10362 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Aging skin. Topical vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in Asian females aged 30-65 years shows that applying a specific liquid product, (Antioxidant and Collagen Booster Serum, Max Biocare Pty Ltd.) containing vitamin E 1%, vitamin C 20%, and red raspberry leaf cell culture extract 0.0005%, to the face nightly for 8 weeks, in addition to regular facial skin products, improves skin color, elasticity, radiance, smoothness, and appearance of wrinkles when compared with regular facial skin products alone ( 102355 ). more Aluminum phosphide poisoning. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in the management of aluminum phosphide poisoning. A small clinical study in patients in Iran admitted to the intensive care unit with aluminum phosphide poisoning shows that administering vitamin E 400 mg intramuscularly twice daily reduces malondialdehyde levels, mechanical ventilation duration, and mortality when compared with supportive care alone ( 114119 ). more Anemia of chronic disease. Small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin E might improve response to anemia treatment in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Two small studies in adults and children on chronic hemodialysis have shown improved response to erythropoietin with vitamin E supplementation ( 4640 , 4647 ). In one study, children given vitamin E 22.4 IU/kg in combination with erythropoietin had significantly increased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels after 2 weeks of combination treatment, compared with eight and five weeks in patients receiving erythropoietin alone ( 4640 ). In a study of adults, concurrent supplementation with vitamin E 745 IU daily allowed dose reductions of erythropoietin from an average of 93 U/kg/week to 74 U/kg/week with the same resultant hemoglobin levels ( 4647 ). more Anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with breast cancer receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy shows that taking vitamin E 600 mg three times daily and L-carnitine 3000 mg by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by 300 mg by mouth four times daily thereafter for 3 weeks reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 63% and improved laboratory markers of cardiotoxicity when compared with chemotherapy alone ( 112338 ). It is unclear if these findings are due to vitamin E, L-carnitine, or the combination. more Anxiety. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with anxiety. A meta-analysis of 5 mostly small clinical studies in patients without anxiety shows that taking vitamin E 200-400 IU daily for up to 10 weeks does not improve anxiety symptom scores when compared with placebo ( 112158 ). It is unclear if these findings can be generalized to patients with anxiety disorders. more Asthma. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for asthma treatment or prevention. There is inconsistent evidence about the role of vitamin E in asthma. Some population research has found that increased dietary intake of vitamin E is associated with a lower risk of asthma; however taking vitamin E supplements are not associated with decreased risk ( 6058 , 15006 ). Low vitamin E intake also appears to be associated with an increased risk of asthma ( 315 , 401 , 422 ). A small clinical study in children with asthma suggests that adding vitamin E 74.5 IU by mouth daily to fluticasone treatment for 8 weeks may decrease cough, wheezing, and dyspnea when compared with baseline ( 90077 ). This study was limited because it did not compare the vitamin E intervention to the control group. more Atopic disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces the risk of atopic disease in infants. Population research has found that increased maternal vitamin E intake isn't associated with decreased odds of developing eczema, food allergy, wheeze, allergic sensitization, or any allergic disease in infants ( 90098 ). more Bladder cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces bladder cancer risk. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that the highest intake of vitamin E is associated with a reduced risk for bladder cancer when compared to the lowest intake in patients followed for more than 10 years. This benefit was not seen in those followed for less than 10 years. This effect appears to be dose-dependent, although it is not clear how much vitamin E intake is required to reduce bladder cancer risk. Additionally, it is not clear whether this benefit differs for dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin E ( 101435 ). Population research also suggests that regular use of vitamin E supplements for more than 10 years is associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer mortality; however, use for less than 10 years is not associated with reduced mortality ( 9839 ). In 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding vitamin E and bladder cancer risk. However, the FDA has determined that it is highly unlikely that vitamin E supplements reduce the risk of bladder cancer ( 102332 ). A moderate-sized clinical study in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU orally daily for an average of 1.5 years increases the risk of recurrence, but not progression or death, when compared with placebo ( 114116 ). more Burns. It is unclear if topical vitamin E is beneficial for healing of burn wounds. A small clinical study in patients with moderate and deep burn wounds (25% to 67%) shows that applying a specific alpha-tocopherol product (Filme Olio) daily seems to reduce infection and improve healing when compared with usual treatment ( 104407 ). more Carpal tunnel syndrome. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking a combination product containing vitamin E, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, and other ingredients orally twice daily for 60 days reduces symptom severity and pain, but does not improve measures of hand and wrist function, when compared with control ( 111702 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin E, other ingredients, or the combination. more Chemotherapy-related infection. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with infection due to chemotherapy. Observational research suggests that greater dietary intake of vitamin E may lower the incidence of infection in children undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoblastic leukemia ( 11997 ). more Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there is interest in using oral vitamin E for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin E for this condition. Cisplatin-associated ototoxicity. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for preventing ototoxicity due to cisplatin. A small clinical study in patients receiving cisplatin for solid tumors shows that taking a specific vitamin E supplement (Rigentex, Bracco) as alpha-tocopherol 400 IU daily for 3 months attenuates hearing loss when compared with placebo ( 97082 ). more Colistin-induced nephrotoxicity. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for preventing nephrotoxicity due to colistin. A small clinical study in patients receiving colistin therapy shows that taking vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 400 IU orally daily for the duration of colistin therapy does not reduce the incidence or duration of acute kidney injury when compared with colistin alone ( 107867 ). more Contrast induced nephropathy. It is unclear if oral or intravenous vitamin E is beneficial in patients with nephropathy due to contrast dye. A small clinical study in patients receiving elective computer-assisted tomography with nonionic radiocontrast agents shows that receiving vitamin E 3218 IU emulsion in 0.45% saline intravenously infused at the rate of 1 mL/kg/hr over 24 hours does not decrease the risk of contrast agent-induced nephropathy when compared with normal saline alone ( 90081 ). However, oral vitamin E may modestly reduce the risk of contrast induced nephropathy. A clinical trial shows that taking vitamin E as alpha-tocopherol 522 IU or gamma-tocopherol 447 IU orally daily, starting 5 days prior to the procedure and continuing 2 days post-procedure, results in a 9% to 10% lower incidence of contrast induced acute kidney injury when compared with standard treatment with normal saline ( 90096 ). Another clinical study shows that taking a single dose of vitamin E 1490 IU orally before elective coronary angiography reduces the risk of contrast induced kidney injury by 7% when compared with placebo ( 97074 ). more Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for recovery after CABG. When taking vitamin E orally with vitamin C and allopurinol two days prior to CABG and one day postoperatively, patients had fewer perioperative infarctions and lower creatine kinase-MB release ( 4699 ); however, this benefit was not found when using vitamin E alone or in combination with vitamin C without allopurinol ( 4697 , 4698 ). Other clinical research in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery in Iran shows that taking vitamin E 1200 IU and zinc 120 mg orally the day before surgery and vitamin E 200 IU and zinc 30 mg orally daily for 3 weeks after the surgery reduces hospital length of stay by approximately 2 days when compared with placebo ( 114118 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin E, zinc, or the combination. Additionally, the generalizability of this result is limited by the single-center study design and inclusion of only lower risk patients. more Critical illness (trauma). An analysis of several small clinical studies suggests that oral or intravenous vitamin E is not beneficial in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A meta-analysis of 5 small clinical studies in patients admitted to the ICU shows that administration of oral or intravenous vitamin E 400-3000 IU daily for up to 4 weeks does not decrease the length of hospital or ICU stay or reduce the risk of mortality when compared with control ( 112335 ). The validity of these findings is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity among the studies, which included differences in vitamin E dosing, duration of therapy, and reasons for ICU admission. more Dementia. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for dementia prevention; the available research is conflicting. A longitudinal cohort study in Japanese adults aged 40 years or older at baseline who were followed for a median of about 20 years, shows that total daily dietary intake of vitamin E is inversely associated with the risk of developing dementia, with a hazard ratio of about 0.8 for the highest compared with lowest quartiles of intake ( 107857 ). In a longitudinal cohort study of males aged 71-93 years, consuming supplemental vitamin E and vitamin C decreased the risk of developing vascular and mixed or other dementias; however, there was no protective effect for Alzheimer dementia ( 4636 ). Evidence from clinical research that evolved into an observational study shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU daily does not decrease the incidence of dementia in males 60 years or older ( 93570 ). However, the results from this study are limited by selection bias due to the high education levels and relatively young age of the participants, limitations with case ascertainment, and problems with follow-up ( 93570 , 93571 ). Also, these studies did not distinguish between different forms of vitamin E ( 4636 , 93570 ). more Depression. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with depression. A meta-analysis of 7 mostly small clinical studies in patients without major depressive disorder shows that taking vitamin E 400-2000 IU daily for up to 6 months modestly improves depression symptom scores when compared with placebo ( 112158 ). It is unclear if these findings can be generalized to patients with depression. more Developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for DCD; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), also known as dyspraxia, shows that taking vitamin E orally, in combination with evening primrose oil, thyme oil, and fish oils, for 4 months seems to improve movement when compared with control ( 5708 ). The effects of vitamin E alone on DCD are unclear. more Diabetes. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of diabetes. Population research has found that higher vitamin E dietary intake is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes ( 14004 ). However, individual clinical studies in patients with existing diabetes show mixed results ( 13496 , 13497 , 90095 , 90099 , 98259 ). A meta-analysis of 36 small clinical studies in patients with diabetes suggests that vitamin E may slightly improve some measures of glycemic control. In patients with type 2 diabetes, vitamin E seems to reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by around 0.2% and improve insulin resistance, but not fasting blood glucose, when compared with placebo. In patients with type 1 diabetes, vitamin E seems to reduce HbA1c by around 0.8%, but does not improve fasting blood glucose, when compared with placebo ( 112161 ). The validity of this analysis is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity across the studies, including differences in vitamin E dose, treatment duration, concomitant medications, patient populations, and study designs. more Diabetic foot ulcers. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for diabetic foot ulcers; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in adults with a grade 3 diabetic foot ulcer shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU and magnesium oxide 250 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces ulcer length, width, and depth when compared with placebo ( 101436 ). A small clinical study in adults with non-healing diabetic foot ulcers being treated with a platelet-rich plasma fibrin glue dressing shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU and vitamin C 12.5 mg orally twice daily for 8 weeks increases the rate of ulcer healing when compared with placebo. In those receiving vitamins, 46% of wounds closed completely, compared with 17% of those receiving placebo ( 107870 ). It is not clear if the effects seen in these studies are due to vitamin E, the other nutrients, or the combinations. more Diabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function. A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking vitamin E 600-1200 mg daily, alone or with other antioxidants, modestly reduces urinary albumin excretion when compared with placebo or no treatment, but seems to have no effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ( 97069 ). A small clinical study in patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking a specific tocotrienol-rich vitamin E supplement (Tocovid SupraBio, Hovid Nutriworld) 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks seems to modestly reduce serum creatinine, with a corresponding increase in GFR, when compared with placebo. According to a sub-group analysis, these improvements remain statistically significant in patients with low tocopherol levels (less than 42 mcmol/L) at baseline, but not in those with higher levels at baseline ( 103010 ). Another small clinical study shows that taking this same supplement regimen for 12 months reduces serum creatinine levels and improves GFR at 8 months, but not 12 months, when compared with placebo. In a subgroup analysis of patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease, these benefits persisted at 12 months when compared with placebo ( 107390 ). more Diabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for improving diabetic neuropathy symptoms. A small clinical trial in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and neuropathy shows that taking a specific vitamin E supplement (Evion) 400 IU daily for 12 weeks modestly decreases neuropathic pain scores when compared to baseline ( 90091 ). Another very small clinical trial shows that taking vitamin E 1341 IU daily for 6 months improves nerve conduction in diabetic neuropathy when compared with placebo ( 4724 ). more Down syndrome. Oral vitamin E does not seem to slow cognitive decline in patients with this condition. A clinical study in patients over 50 years old with Down syndrome shows that taking vitamin E 1000 IU twice daily for 3 years does not slow cognitive decline when compared with placebo ( 97076 ). more Endometriosis. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical trial in patients with endometriosis and pelvic pain shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU and vitamin C 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks improves dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain scores when compared with placebo ( 106622 ). more Extravasation. Topical vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO); its effect when used alone is unclear. A very small clinical study in patients receiving chemotherapy shows that applying vitamin E topically, in combination with DMSO, seems to prevent skin ulceration after chemotherapy extravasation ( 4668 ). more Gastric cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for preventing gastric cancer or reducing associated mortality. Population studies have found that increasing dietary vitamin E intake by 22.4 IU daily is associated with a 21% decreased risk of gastric cancer ( 3360 , 90083 ). However, clinical trials have not found that vitamin E supplements reduce gastric cancer risk ( 3960 , 4676 , 4677 , 12185 ). Studies evaluating vitamin E in combination with other supplements have been inconsistent. In one large-scale clinical trial a specific combination of vitamin E 100 IU with selenium 37.5 mcg and vitamin C 250 mg twice daily for about 7 years did not reduce risk of gastric cancer in patients from Shandong Province in China where there is a very high prevalence of gastric cancer ( 14447 , 90085 ). In another large-scale clinical study of 29,584 people in China, the combination of oral vitamin E, beta-carotene, and selenium over 5 years did reduce total mortality, total cancer mortality, and stomach cancer mortality ( 4679 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E plus beta-carotene with or without vitamin C does not reduce gastric cancer incidence ( 12185 ). more Glomerulosclerosis. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces proteinuria due to glomerulosclerosis in children. A very small clinical study in children with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis who are refractory to standard medical management shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU daily orally might reduce proteinuria when compared with baseline ( 4675 ). The validity of this finding is limited by a lack of control group. more Granuloma annulare. Although there is interest in using topical vitamin E for granuloma annulare, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin E for this condition. Helicobacter pylori. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A clinical study in patients with Helicobacter pylori dyspepsia without ulcers shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU and vitamin C 500 mg by mouth twice daily for 30 days in addition to standard triple therapy increases eradication rates by 37% when compared with triple therapy alone ( 90094 ). It is not clear if this benefit is due to vitamin E, vitamin C, or the combination. more Huntington disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin E improves Huntington disease symptoms. A small clinical study shows that taking RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) might improve symptoms in patients with early Huntington disease, but this benefit is not seen in patients with more advanced disease when compared with placebo ( 4686 ). more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for hypertension. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in adults with hypertension shows that taking vitamin E 200-400 IU orally daily for 2-27 weeks substantially lowers systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic blood pressure, when compared with control ( 113668 ). The validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity. Other preliminary clinical research in patients with hypertension who are receiving conventional treatment shows that taking vitamin E 300 mg daily orally for 3-4 years does not lower blood pressure when compared with control ( 5210 ). more IgA nephropathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for IgA nephropathy in children. A small clinical study in children with IgA nephropathy shows that taking vitamin E (400 IU for those weighing less than 30 kg; 800 IU for those weighing more than 30 kg) improves urinary protein to creatinine ratio, but not glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance, or hematuria, when compared with placebo ( 85063 ). more Infertility. It is unclear if oral vitamin E improves pregnancy rates in females with infertility of unknown cause. A small clinical study in females experiencing implantation failure shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU daily for 12 weeks improves endometrial thickness when compared with placebo ( 99852 ). However, an observational study suggests that there is no association between dietary vitamin E intake and in-vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes including good oocyte quality, embryo transfer success rates, clinical pregnancy rates, and successful term pregnancy rates in subfertile couples who are candidates for IVF ( 112097 ). Vitamin E has also been studied in combination with selenium. In a small clinical study in patients with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), taking vitamin E 400 IU with selenium 200 mcg orally daily for 90 days increases anti-Mullerian hormone index, antral follicle count, and mean ovarian volume after 12 months of follow-up when compared with placebo ( 107866 ). It is unclear if these improvements correlate to higher pregnancy or live birth rates. more Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although there is interest in using oral vitamin E for IBD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin E for this condition. Insomnia. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with insomnia. A moderate-sized clinical study in postmenopausal patients with chronic insomnia shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU daily for 1 month improves sleep quality ratings and reduces the need for sedative medications when compared with placebo ( 112163 ). more Intermittent claudication. It is unclear if oral vitamin E improves intermittent claudication symptoms. A large clinical study in male smokers with intermittent claudication shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 50 mg orally daily for about 3.7 years does not appear to have any effect when used alone or in combination with beta-carotene for treating symptoms or disease progression when compared with placebo ( 4732 ). However, according to poor-quality clinical research included in a meta-analysis, taking vitamin E 447-2384 IU daily for up to 18 months appears to reduce symptoms of intermittent claudication ( 85023 ). more Lice. Topical synthetic vitamin E might be beneficial for head lice eradication. A small clinical study in children and adults with head lice shows that topical application of a specific tocopheryl acetate 20% spray (LiceKO, Panin SRL) once, and then again 7 days later, is more effective for eliminating lice when compared with permethrin 1% cream rinse ( 90067 ). more Male infertility. An analysis of several small, low-quality clinical studies suggests that oral vitamin E might improve pregnancy rates and measures of sperm health in males with infertility. Several small clinical studies in males with infertility show conflicting results ( 3583 , 4695 , 107865 ). However, a meta-analysis of 7 small, low-quality clinical trials shows that taking vitamin E 300-600 IU for 12-48 weeks increases pregnancy rates by 86% and modestly improves sperm count, concentration, motility, and vitality, but does not seem to increase semen volume, when compared with a control ( 109461 ). Vitamin E has also been used in combination with other nutrients with unclear results. Small studies show that taking vitamin E 800 mg daily with vitamin C 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks doesn't seem to improve sperm functionality ( 4696 ), while vitamin E 400 IU plus selenium 200 mcg daily for at least 100 days improves sperm functionality, but not fertilization rates, when compared with baseline ( 3585 ). In another small clinical study in infertile males undergoing varicocelectomy, taking vitamin E 400 IU, selenium 200 mcg, and folic acid 5 mg daily for 6 months improved sperm count and motility when compared with control ( 102968 ). Another small clinical study shows that taking vitamin E 100 mg and coenzyme Q10 10 mg three times daily for 3 months modestly increases levels of testosterone and improves progressive sperm motility and morphology when compared to baseline. However, taking an L-carnitine nutrient complex 15 grams twice daily was more effective for increasing testosterone and improving sperm parameters ( 109390 ). However, it is unclear if any of these combination therapies increases live birth rates. more Melanoma. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for reducing melanoma risk. A sub-group analysis of a large-scale clinical trial in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease suggests that taking RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 400 IU daily for about 7 years is not linked with a reduced risk of developing melanoma when compared with placebo ( 13036 ). more Menopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for reducing menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. A small clinical study in postmenopausal patients shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU twice daily for 8 weeks reduces hot flashes, but does not affect other menopausal symptoms or anxiety, when compared with placebo. The improvement in hot flashes was no longer present 4 weeks after the intervention ( 102969 ). However, a meta-analysis of 3 small clinical studies in postmenopausal patients, including the study above, shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU daily for 8 weeks does not reduce hot flash frequency when compared with placebo ( 111460 ). more Methotrexate toxicity. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces the risk of liver toxicity due to methotrexate. An observational study in patients taking methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis has found that taking vitamin E 400 mg twice daily for 3 months is associated with reductions in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) levels when compared with no supplementation. This suggests a reduction in liver injury in the treatment group ( 104414 ). more Muscular dystrophy. Small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin E may not improve muscular dystrophy symptoms or progression. Small clinical studies in patients with myotonic or Duchenne muscular dystrophy show that taking vitamin E along with penicillamine or selenium doesn't appear to slow disease progression or improve symptoms when compared with placebo ( 4703 , 4704 ). more Nocturnal leg cramps. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces leg cramps in veterans or in patients on hemodialysis. A small clinical study in adults undergoing hemodialysis shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU at bedtime for 2 months seems to reduce the frequency of nocturnal leg cramps when compared with placebo ( 4701 ). However, another small clinical study in male veterans shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU at bedtime for 4 weeks does not reduce cramp frequency or severity or reduce sleep disturbances when compared with placebo ( 4702 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in adults or children with NAFLD. One meta-analysis of studies assessing both NAFLD patients and patients in whom NAFLD progressed to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) shows that taking vitamin E 100-800 IU daily for 1-24 months improves liver enzyme levels, hepatic steatosis, and lobular inflammation when compared with control. However, taking vitamin E does not appear to improve hepatic fibrosis in these patients ( 97077 ). Methodological limitations such as publication bias and unclear calculations limit the reliability of these results. Another meta-analysis of 8 small clinical trials in adults with NAFLD shows that taking vitamin E 400-800 IU daily for up to 24 weeks improves liver enzyme levels when compared with placebo ( 112336 ). Vitamin E has also been evaluated in children with NAFLD. A meta-analysis of studies in this population shows that taking vitamin E 15-900 IU daily for up to 24 months reduces total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, but does not affect liver enzyme levels, measures of insulin resistance, body mass index (BMI), ballooning degeneration of the liver, or liver fibrosis when compared with placebo ( 107861 ). Until additional data showing its benefit becomes available, practice guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) state that vitamin E is not recommended in patients with NAFLD without liver biopsy ( 98130 ). more Obesity. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for improving weight loss. A meta-analysis of 24 small clinical studies shows that taking oral vitamin E, 67-900 mg daily does not affect weight, body mass index (BMI), or waist circumference in adults with obesity. In fact, in people with a normal BMI, vitamin E seems to increase body weight ( 107859 ). more Oral mucositis. It is unclear if oral or topical vitamin E is beneficial in patients with oral mucositis from chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Vitamin E has been evaluated in both chemotherapy- and radiation-induced mucositis. A small clinical study in children with chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis shows that a specific vitamin E product (Evion Paediatric Drops, Merck Limited) 200 IU applied topically in three divided doses daily for 1 week improves healing, pain, and the ability to eat when compared with placebo ( 94585 ). However, another small clinical study in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer shows that taking vitamin E 1000 mg once daily with pentoxifylline 400 mg twice daily does not reduce the incidence or severity of oral mucositis and dysphagia when compared with control ( 102972 ). more Osteopenia. It is unclear if oral vitamin E helps slow the progression of osteopenia. A small clinical study in postmenopausal adults with osteopenia who are taking calcium and vitamin D supplements shows that taking vitamin E (mixed tocopherols) 400 IU daily for 12 weeks prevents the increase in serum C-terminal telopeptide, a marker of bone resorption, seen with placebo over that same time period ( 107868 ). more Osteoporosis. It is unclear if oral vitamin E helps to reduce complications of osteoporosis such as fractures. Observational research has found that vitamin E supplementation is associated with a 22% lower risk of hip fracture and a 14% lower risk of all fractures in elderly females with osteoporosis ( 90086 ). Additional observational research has found that higher dietary vitamin E intake is also associated with a 34% reduced risk of fractures in adults at risk for osteoporosis ( 104415 ). more Periodontitis. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in patients with moderate or advanced periodontitis shows that taking a supplement containing vitamin E, alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, and other ingredients orally twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard nonsurgical therapy does not improve periodontal indices including bleeding on probing, gingival recession, plaque index, or inflammation, among others, when compared with placebo ( 111708 ). more Peyronie disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces Peyronie disease symptoms. A small clinical study in patients with Peyronie disease shows that taking vitamin E 894 IU daily in addition to conservative treatment for 6 months does not improve pain, but may reduce plaque, when compared with using conservative treatment alone. Conservative treatment included verapamil 10 mg biweekly injection and iontophoresis, blueberries 160 mg orally daily, propolis 600 mg orally daily, and topical diclofenac 4% twice daily ( 90090 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to vitamin E, the other interventions, or the combination. more Photoreactive keratectomy. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated for recovery after photoreactive keratectomy in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients undergoing laser surgery for myopia shows that taking vitamin A (retinol palmitate) 50,000-75,000 units with vitamin E (alpha-tocopheryl nicotinate) 343 IU daily seems to accelerate re-epithelialization, reduce haze formation, and improve visual acuity when compared with placebo ( 348 ). more Physical performance. It is unclear if oral vitamin E improves physical performance in the elderly. Population research has found that increasing intake of dietary vitamin E is associated with increased physical performance and muscle strength in elderly people ( 14006 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Analyses of small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin E may modestly reduce lipid levels in patients with PCOS. It is unclear if vitamin E can improve glycemic control, body weight, hormone levels, or symptoms of PCOS. Meta-analyses of several small clinical studies in patients with PCOS show that taking vitamin E, alone or in combination with coenzyme Q10, fish oil, magnesium, or vitamin D, reduces total cholesterol by 9-18 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 7-16 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 13-21 mg/dL when compared with placebo. However, vitamin E does not appear to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, reduce body weight, or improve hirsutism. The effects of vitamin E on glycemic indices and levels of testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin are unclear; individual meta-analyses show mixed results ( 112167 , 112168 , 112169 ). The validity of these findings is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity across the included studies, which varied in vitamin E dosing, treatment duration, and concomitant supplements used. more Premature rupture of membranes (PROM). Oral vitamin E does not seem to prevent PROM, although it's unclear if it might prevent premature delivery due to PROM. Vitamin E has been evaluated for the prevention and management of PROM. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E with other ingredients throughout pregnancy does not affect the risk of developing PROM when compared with placebo ( 97075 ). However, a clinical study in patients with PROM shows that taking vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol acetate) 400 IU and vitamin C 1000 mg daily, starting within 1 hour of membrane rupture and continuing for an unspecified amount of time, seems to hold back premature delivery by about 5 days when compared with placebo. However, maternal or neonatal outcomes did not seem to be affected ( 90078 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to vitamin E, vitamin C, or the combination. more Radiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical vitamin E is effective for the prevention or treatment of radiation dermatitis. A small clinical study in patients undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer shows that applying a cream containing nanoparticles of vitamin E 2%, three times daily and after each radiation session until 2 weeks after radiation therapy is complete, does not reduce the severity of radiation dermatitis or improve quality of life when compared with a placebo cream. However, in patients that did not receive a boosted radiation dose, this vitamin E cream seems to slightly delay the onset of dermatitis when compared with placebo ( 112333 ). more Radiation fibrosis. It is unclear if topical vitamin E reduces radiation fibrosis symptoms. Clinical research shows that taking vitamin E 1000 IU orally with pentoxifylline 800 mg daily seems to reverse radiation fibrosis ( 4672 , 4673 ). Regression of radiation fibrosis becomes significant after three months of treatment and continues to improve thereafter. After 12 months of treatment, mean surface area of fibrosis can decrease by 66% ( 4672 ). It is unclear if the benefit is due to vitamin E, pentoxifylline, or the combination. One very small study suggests that vitamin E alone does not seem to be effective when compared with placebo ( 10363 ). more Radiation-induced sialadenitis. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is effective for the prevention or treatment of radiation-induced sialadenitis. A small clinical study in patients undergoing radiation therapy for thyroid cancer shows that taking vitamin E 200 mg daily for 5 weeks, starting 1 week before radiotherapy, improves several measures of parotid and submandibular salivary gland function when compared to baseline, suggesting that vitamin E might prevent radiation-induced sialadenitis and its associated complications ( 112332 ). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group. more Renal cell carcinoma. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces renal cell carcinoma risk. In 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding vitamin E and renal cell carcinoma risk. This qualified health claim was based on one weak and limited study. The FDA has determined that it is highly uncertain that vitamin E supplements reduce the risk of renal cell carcinoma ( 102332 ). more Restless legs syndrome (RLS). Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in hemodialysis patients shows that taking vitamin E 596 IU, vitamin C 200 mg, or a combination of both daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces severity of restless legs syndrome when compared with placebo ( 90093 ). more Retinopathy of prematurity. It is unclear whether oral or parenteral vitamin E reduces the risk for retinopathy in prematurity (ROP). A clinical study in very low birth weight infants with respiratory distress syndrome suggests that giving vitamin E 12.5 IU twice daily from 72 hours after birth through 28 days of age might reduce the incidence of stage 1 ROP when compared with placebo. However, the difference reached significance in the per-protocol analysis, but not in the intention-to-treat analysis ( 107864 ). Also, a meta-analysis that did not include this more recent study shows that administering oral, intravenous, or intramuscular vitamin E daily does not reduce the risk for ROP. Additionally, high levels of vitamin E and large intravenous doses of vitamin E have been associated with an increased risk for sepsis in premature infants ( 85062 ). more Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with RA. A small clinical study in adults with RA shows that taking vitamin E 600 mg twice daily in conjunction with standard therapy for 12 weeks is superior to standard therapy alone for reducing pain, but not inflammation ( 4723 ). However, other studies show mixed results. A meta-analysis of 7 small clinical studies in patients with RA shows that taking vitamin E up to 1200 IU daily for up to 12 weeks does not reduce pain, tenderness, swelling, or morning stiffness when compared with control ( 112330 ). more Schizophrenia. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Taking vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol) 135.8 IU and a specific ascorbic acid supplement (CellaVie) 250 mg with or without ethyl eicosapentaenoate 500 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve negative or positive symptoms of schizophrenia when compared with placebo ( 89234 ). more Sickle cell disease. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin E for sickle cell disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin E for this condition. Stretch marks (striae distensae). Topical vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research shows that using a moisturizer containing vitamin E, rosehip oil, hydroxyprolisilane C, and gotu kola triterpenes at least twice daily on affected areas does not decrease incidence of new stretch marks, but does decrease the severity of new stretch marks by about 30%, when compared with control cream in pregnant patients ( 90076 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to vitamin E, other ingredients, or the combination. more Stroke. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for reducing stroke risk. A trial-sequential meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials with 148,000 patients shows that vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of total stroke when compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis, vitamin E was associated with an 8% lower risk of ischemic stroke and a trend to an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke when compared with placebo. Based on subgroup analyses, there was no difference on risk based on vitamin E dosage, use of synthetic versus natural vitamin E, and whether prevention was primary or secondary ( 104408 ). This analysis was limited due to high heterogeneity, small study size, and insufficient power to detect differences between treatments. Older meta-analyses also found mixed results of using vitamin E 74.5-1192 IU daily alone or in combination for up to 10 years. However, there was a similar sub-group analysis finding that vitamin E might reduce the risk of ischemic stroke, but it might also increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke ( 14621 , 85201 ). Some clinical research shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) might reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in male smokers with hypertension and diabetes ( 3359 ). more Sunburn. Topical vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Oral vitamin E alone does not seem to prevent sunburn. Two small, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies suggest that taking high dose oral RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) up to 2 grams daily in combination with vitamin C 3 grams protects against skin inflammation after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, taking vitamin E alone does not seem to be beneficial when compared with control ( 4715 , 4716 ). This combination was also tried topically. In one study, topically applied vitamin E in combination with topical vitamin C and melatonin provided modest photoprotective effect when used prior to UV exposure, but had no effect when used during or after UV exposure ( 4713 , 4714 ). more Uveitis. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research shows that taking vitamin E 149 IU twice daily with vitamin C 500 mg daily for 8 weeks improves visual acuity in patients with acute anterior uveitis, but does not seem to decrease inflammation measured by laser flare, when compared with placebo ( 4730 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to vitamin E, vitamin C, or the combination. more Vaginal atrophy. It is unclear if a vitamin E suppository is beneficial in patients with vaginal atrophy. A small clinical study in females with breast cancer and tamoxifen-induced vaginal atrophy shows that intravaginal administration of a vitamin E 1 mg suppository nightly before bed for 8 weeks improves self-reported symptoms of vaginal atrophy, decreases vaginal pH, and improves vaginal estrogenization, as measured by the Vaginal Maturation Index, when compared with placebo ( 99773 ). more More evidence is needed to rate vitamin E for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally or topically and appropriately. Vitamin E is generally considered safe, even at doses exceeding the recommended dietary allowance (RDA); however, adverse effects are more likely to occur with higher doses. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) in healthy people is 1000 mg daily, equivalent to 1100 IU of synthetic vitamin E (all-rac-alpha-tocopherol) or 1500 IU of natural vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol) ( 4668 , 4681 , 4713 , 4714 , 4844 , 89234 , 90067 , 90069 , 90072 , 19206 )( 63244 , 97075 ). Although there is some concern that taking vitamin E in doses of 400 IU (form unspecified) per day or higher might increase the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality from all causes ( 12212 , 13036 , 15305 , 16709 , 83339 ), most of this evidence comes from studies that included middle-aged or older patients with chronic diseases or patients from developing countries in which nutritional deficiencies are prevalent. Possibly Unsafe when used orally in high doses. Repeated doses exceeding the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1000 mg daily are associated with significant side effects in otherwise healthy people ( 4844 ). ...when used intravenously in large doses. Large repeated intravenous doses of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) were associated with decreased activity of clotting factors and bleeding in one report ( 3074 ). ...when inhaled. E-cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated lung injury (EVALI) has occurred among adults who use e-cigarette, or vaping, products, which often contain vitamin E acetate. In some cases, this has resulted in death. The majority of patients with EVALI reported using tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products in the 3 months prior to the development of symptoms. Vitamin E acetate has been detected in most bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken from patients with EVALI. Other ingredients, including THC or nicotine, were also commonly found in samples. However, priority toxicants including medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, plant oil, petroleum distillate, or terpenes, were undetectable in almost all samples. While this association shows a correlation between vitamin E acetate inhalation and lung injury, a causal link has not yet been determined, and it is not clear if other toxic compounds are also involved ( 101061 , 101062 , 102970 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Vitamin E has been safely used in children in amounts below the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL for healthy children is: 200 mg in children aged 1-3 years, 300 mg in children aged 4-8 years, 600 mg in children aged 9-13 years, and 800 mg in children aged 14-18 years. A UL has not been established for infants up to 12 months of age ( 23388 ). CHILDREN: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in doses above the UL due to increased risk of adverse effects ( 23388 ). ...when alpha-tocopherol is used intravenously in large doses in premature infants. Large intravenous doses of vitamin E are associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis in this population ( 85062 , 85083 ). ...when inhaled. E-cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated lung injury (EVALI) has occurred among adolescents and teenagers who use e-cigarette, or vaping, products. In some cases, this has resulted in death. The majority of patients with EVALI reported using tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products in the 3 months prior to the development of symptoms. Constituents in E-cigarette or vaping products with the potential to cause lung injury or impaired lung function include lipids, such as vitamin E acetate. Vitamin E acetate has been detected in all bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken from patients with EVALI. No other ingredient, including THC or nicotine, was found in all samples, and other ingredients, including medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, plant oil, petroleum distillate, or terpenes, were undetectable This shows that vitamin E acetate is at the primary site of lung injury. A causal link has not yet been described and it is not clear if other compounds are also involved ( 101061 , 101062 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) during pregnancy is 800 mg for those 14-18 years of age and 1000 mg for those 19 years and older. However, maternal supplementation is not generally recommended unless dietary vitamin E falls below the RDA ( 4260 ). No serious adverse effects were reported with oral intake of 400 IU per day starting at weeks 9-22 of pregnancy in healthy patients or those at high risk for pre-eclampsia ( 3236 , 97075 ), or with 600-900 IU daily during the last two months of pregnancy ( 4260 ). However, some preliminary evidence suggests that taking vitamin E supplements might be harmful when taken in early pregnancy. A case-control study found that taking a vitamin E supplement during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy is associated with a 1.7-9-fold increase in odds of congenital heart defects ( 16823 ). However, the exact amount of vitamin E consumed during pregnancy in this study is unclear. Until more is known, advise patients to avoid taking a vitamin E supplement in early pregnancy unless needed for an appropriate medical indication. LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL during lactation is 800 mg for those 14-18 years of age and 1000 mg for those 19 years and older ( 4844 ). LACTATION: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in amounts that exceed the UL due to increased risk of adverse effects ( 4844 ).</data><data key="dosing_text">Adult Oral: General : The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin E (as alpha-tocopherol) is 15 mg daily. For RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E), the RDA is 22 IU; for all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E), it is 33 IU ( 4844 ). The RDA during pregnancy is 15 mg; the RDA during lactation is 19 mg ( 4844 ). See the Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Taking vitamin E with food seems to improve absorption. Some research suggests that taking vitamin E with high-fat food may further improve absorption because the fat allows for solubilization and incorporation into micelles ( 4844 , 85095 , 97072 ). However, other research suggests that low-fat food can also improve vitamin E absorption ( 6133 , 6405 ). Dosing for vitamin E can be confusing. Quantities may be listed in various sources and clinical studies as mg or International Units (IU). Current guidelines have expressed RDAs and tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamin E in mg. However, some products are still labeled in IUs. Thus, it is important to understand how to convert between IUs and mg of vitamin E. The appropriate method for doing this depends on the formulation of vitamin E being considered and whether an RDA or a UL is being calculated. For an RDA calculation, RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) can be converted from IU to mg of alpha-tocopherol by multiplying by a factor of 0.67. For example, 30 IU of RRR-alpha-tocopherol equals 20 mg. To convert all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) from IU to mg of alpha-tocopherol, multiply by a factor of 0.45. For example, 30 IU all-rac-alpha-tocopherol equals 13.5 mg. When calculating a UL, the conversion factor for RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) remains the same. However, the conversion factor for all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) is different because the UL assumes that all isomers of vitamin E can contribute to toxicity. To convert all-rac-alpha tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) from IU to mg, multiply by a factor of 0.91. For example, 2000 IUs all-rac-alpha tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) is equivalent to 1820 mg. The same factors are used for either acetate or succinate salts because the content has been adjusted for the molecular weights of the salts ( 4844 ). Topical: Vitamin E has been used in various formulations, including a spray, cream, intravaginal suppository, and more. See the Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Children Oral: General : The RDAs for vitamin E (as alpha-tocopherol) in children are: 0-6 months of age, 4 mg; 7-12 months of age, 5 mg; 1-3 years of age, 6 mg; 4-8 years of age, 7 mg; 9-13 years of age, 11 mg; 14 years and older, 15 mg ( 4844 ). See the Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization &amp; Formulation All-rac-alpha-tocopherol is the synthetic version of vitamin E. RRR-alpha-tocopherol is vitamin E extracted from natural sources ( 12212 ). Vitamin E exists in eight different forms (isomers): alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol; and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol ( 13504 ).</data><data key="interactions_text">Expand All | Collapse All ALKYLATING AGENTS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, antioxidant effects of vitamin E might reduce the effectiveness of alkylating agents. There's concern that antioxidants could reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs which generate free radicals, such as cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, carmustine, busulfan, and thiotepa ( 391 ). However, some researchers theorize that antioxidants might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that might interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells ( 14012 , 14013 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, antioxidants such as vitamin E have on chemotherapy. Advise patients to consult their oncologist before using vitamin E supplements, especially in high doses. more ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Concomitant use of vitamin E and anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents might increase the risk of bleeding. Vitamin E seems to inhibit of platelet aggregation and antagonize the effects of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors ( 4733 , 4844 , 11580 , 11582 , 11583 , 11584 , 11586 , 112162 ). These effects appear to be dose-dependent, and are probably only likely to be clinically significant with doses of at least 800 units daily ( 11582 , 11585 ). Mixed tocopherols, such as those found in food, might have a greater antiplatelet effect than alpha-tocopherol ( 10364 ). RRR alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 1000 IU daily antagonizes vitamin K-dependent clotting factors ( 11999 ). Advise patients to avoid high doses of vitamin E, especially in people with low vitamin K intake or other risk factors for bleeding. more ANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, antioxidant effects of vitamin E might reduce the effectiveness of antitumor antibiotics. There's concern that antioxidants could reduce the activity of antitumor antibiotic drugs such as doxorubicin, which generate free radicals ( 391 ). However, some researchers theorize that antioxidants might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that might interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells ( 14012 , 14013 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, antioxidants such as vitamin E have on chemotherapy involving antitumor antibiotics. Advise patients to consult their oncologist before using vitamin E supplements, especially in high doses. more CYCLOSPORINE (Neoral, Sandimmune) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) A specific form of vitamin E might increase absorption and levels of cyclosporine. There is some evidence that one specific formulation of vitamin E (D-alpha-tocopheryl-polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate, TPGS, tocophersolan, Liqui-E) might increase absorption of cyclosporine. This vitamin E formulation forms micelles which seems to increase absorption of cyclosporine by 40% to 72% in some patients ( 624 , 625 , 10368 ). However, this interaction is unlikely to occur with the usual forms of vitamin E. more CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, vitamin E might induce metabolism of CYP3A4, possibly reducing the levels CYP3A4 substrates. Vitamin E appears to bind with the nuclear receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), which results in increased expression of CYP3A4 ( 13499 , 13500 ). Although the clinical significance of this is not known, use caution when considering concomitant use of vitamin E and other drugs affected by these enzymes. more NIACIN Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence A (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT)) Vitamin E might decrease the beneficial effects of niacin on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. A combination of niacin and simvastatin (Zocor) effectively raises high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in people with coronary disease and low HDL levels. Clinical research shows that taking a combination of antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and selenium) along with niacin and simvastatin (Zocor) attenuates this rise in HDL, specifically the HDL-2 and apolipoprotein A1 fractions, by more than 50% ( 7388 , 11537 ). Vitamin E alone combined with a statin does not seem to decrease HDL levels ( 11286 , 11287 ). It is not known whether the adverse effect on HDL is due to one of the other antioxidants or to the combination. It also is not known whether it will occur in other patient populations. more SELUMETINIB (Koselugo) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Taking selumetinib with vitamin E can result in a total daily dose of vitamin E that exceeds safe limits and therefore might increase the risk of bleeding. Selumetinib contains 48-54 IU vitamin E per capsule ( 102971 ). The increased risk of bleeding with vitamin E appears to be dose-dependent ( 11582 , 11585 , 34577 ). Be cautious when using selumetinib in combination with supplemental vitamin E, especially in patients at higher risk of bleed, such as those with chronic conditions and those taking antiplatelet drugs ( 102971 ). more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Using vitamin E with warfarin might increase the risk of bleeding. Due to interference with production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, use of more than 400 IU of vitamin E daily with warfarin might increase prothrombin time (PT), INR, and the risk of bleeding, ( 91 , 92 , 93 ). At a dose of 1000 IU per day, vitamin E can antagonize vitamin K-dependent clotting factors even in people not taking warfarin ( 11999 ). Limited clinical evidence suggests that doses up to 1200 IU daily may be used safely by patients taking warfarin, but this may not be applicable in all patient populations ( 90 ). more</data><data key="name">Vitamin E</data><data key="scientific_name">Alpha-tocopherol, Beta-tocopherol, Delta-tocopherol, Gamma-tocopherol</data><data key="overview_text">Vitamin E is an essential fat-soluble vitamin. In 1925, vitamin E was recognized as the fifth vitamin. Due to its effects on fertility, it was named tocopherol, based on the Greek words toc and phero, which mean child and to bring forth, respectively. It occurs naturally in many foods including vegetable oils, wheat germ oil, cereal grains, animal fats, meat, poultry, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. Vitamin E exists as two distinct chemical analogues: tocopherols and tocotrienols. Tocopherols are saturated vitamin E derivatives, while tocotrienols are unsaturated vitamin E derivatives that possess an isoprenoid side chain. Each isomer may have a different role in the action of vitamin E. This monograph focuses on vitamin E provided as tocopherols.</data></node>

The daily RDAs are as follows: females 18 years of age, 9 mg; females 19 years and older, 8 mg; males 18 years and older, 11 mg. During pregnancy, 13 mg in those 18 years of age, 11 mg in those 19 years and older. During lactation, 17 mg in those 18 years of age; 12 mg in those 19 years and older ( 7135 ). Zinc supplements are often used to treat sequelae of zinc deficiency. For other uses, see Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Zinc binds to proteins, becoming available for absorption as the protein is digested ( 7135 ). The type of protein influences how much zinc is absorbed. Animal proteins generally enhance zinc absorption, while plant proteins like soy might reduce zinc absorption ( 7135 , 11672 , 11673 , 11675 ). It is not known whether high-protein diets influence zinc balance in adults.Phytates in food can reduce the amount of zinc absorbed from foods. Phytate is found in grains (e.g., maize, corn, sorghum), legumes, seeds (e.g., sunflower, pumpkin), and soy ( 7135 , 11673 , 11680 ). It forms non-absorbable complexes with zinc. The absorption-inhibiting effect of phytate can be prevented by the presence of phytases, food processing (e.g. fermentation, germination, soaking, milling, and heat), amino acids in animal proteins, and higher zinc intake ( 1858 , 7135 , 11617 , 11673 , 11679 ). Topical: Zinc has been used in various formulations, including lotions, gels, ointments, mouth rinses, and others. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Children Oral: The adequate intake (AI) of zinc for infants up to 6 months of age is 2 mg daily ( 7135 ). For older infants and children, the daily Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of zinc is based on age as follows: 7 months to 3 years, 3 mg; 4-8 years, 5 mg; 9-13 years, 8 mg; females 14-18 years, 9 mg; males 14-18 years, 11 mg. Zinc supplements are often used to treat sequelae of zinc deficiency. For other uses in children, see Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization &amp; Formulation Different salt forms provide different amounts of elemental zinc. Zinc sulfate contains 23% elemental zinc; 220 mg zinc sulfate contains 50 mg zinc. Zinc gluconate contains 14.3% elemental zinc; 10 mg zinc gluconate contains 1.43 mg zinc ( 506 ).</data><data key="interactions_text">Expand All | Collapse All AMILORIDE (Midamor) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity INSIGNIFICANT Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Amiloride can modestly reduce zinc excretion and increase zinc levels. Clinical research shows that amiloride can reduce urinary zinc excretion, especially at doses of 10 mg per day or more. This zinc-sparing effect can help to counteract zinc losses caused by thiazide diuretics, but it is unlikely to cause zinc toxicity at usual amiloride doses ( 830 , 11626 , 11627 , 11634 ). The other potassium-sparing diuretics, spironolactone (Aldactone) and triamterene (Dyrenium), do not seem to have a zinc-sparing effect. more ATAZANAVIR (Reyataz) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity INSIGNIFICANT Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Zinc modestly reduces levels of atazanavir, although this effect does not seem to be clinically significant. Clinical research shows that zinc might decrease serum atazanavir levels by chelating with atazanavir in the gut and preventing its absorption ( 93578 ). Although a single dose of zinc sulfate (Solvazinc tablets) 125 mg orally does not affect atazanavir concentrations in patients being treated with atazanavir/ritonavir, co-administration of zinc sulfate 125 mg daily for 2 weeks reduces plasma levels of atazanavir by about 22% in these patients. However, despite this decrease, atazanavir levels still remain at high enough concentrations for the prevention of HIV virus replication ( 90216 ). more BICTEGRAVIR/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE (Biktarvy) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, zinc might decrease levels of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide by reducing its absorption. Advise patients that bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide should be taken at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after zinc containing products ( 116930 ). more CEPHALEXIN (Keflex) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Zinc might decrease cephalexin levels by chelating with cephalexin in the gut and preventing its absorption. A pharmacokinetic study shows that zinc sulfate 250 mg taken concomitantly with cephalexin 500 mg decreases peak levels of cephalexin by 31% and reduces the exposure to cephalexin by 27%. Also, taking zinc sulfate 3 hours before cephalexin decreases peak levels of cephalexin by 11% and reduces the exposure to cephalexin by 18%. By decreasing cephalexin levels, zinc might increase the risk of treatment failure. This effect does not occur when zinc is taken 3 hours after the cephalexin dose ( 94163 ). To avoid an interaction, advise patients take zinc sulfate 3 hours after taking cephalexin. more CISPLATIN (Platinol-AQ) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, zinc might interfere with the therapeutic effects of cisplatin. Animal research suggests that zinc stimulates tumor cell production of the protein metallothionein, which binds and inactivates cisplatin ( 11624 , 11625 ). It is not known whether zinc supplements or high dietary zinc intake can cause clinically significant interference with cisplatin therapy. Cisplatin might also increase zinc excretion. more INTEGRASE INHIBITORS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, taking zinc along with integrase inhibitors might decrease the levels and clinical effects of these drugs. Zinc is a divalent cation. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that other divalent cations such as calcium and iron can decrease blood levels of the integrase inhibitor dolutegravir through chelation ( 93578 , 93579 ). more PENICILLAMINE (Cuprimine, Depen) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Zinc might reduce the levels and clinical effects of penicillamine. By forming an insoluble complex with penicillamine, zinc interferes with penicillamine absorption and activity. Zinc supplements reduce the efficacy of low-dose penicillamine (0.5-1 gram/day), but do not seem to affect higher doses (1-2.75 gram/day), provided dosing times are separated ( 2678 , 4534 , 11605 ). Advise patients to take zinc and penicillamine at least 2 hours apart. more QUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Zinc can decrease the levels and clinical effects of quinolones antibiotics. Quinolones form complexes with zinc in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing absorption of both the quinolone and zinc if taken at the same time ( 828 , 2682 , 3046 , 11600 ). Advise patients to take these drugs at least 2 hours before, or 4-6 hours after, zinc supplements. more RITONAVIR (Norvir) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Zinc modestly reduces levels of ritonavir. Clinical research shows that zinc might reduce serum ritonavir levels by chelating with ritonavir in the gut and preventing its absorption ( 93578 ). In patients with HIV, ritonavir is taken with atazanavir to prevent the metabolism and increase the effects of atazanavir. A pharmacokinetic study shows that, in patients being treated with atazanavir/ritonavir, co-administration of zinc sulfate (Solvazinc tablets) 125 mg as a single dose or as multiple daily doses for 2 weeks reduces plasma levels of ritonavir by about 16% ( 90216 ). However, atazanavir levels still remains high enough to prevent HIV virus replication. Therefore, the decrease in ritonavir levels is not likely to be clinically significant. more TETRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Zinc might reduce levels of tetracycline antibiotics. Tetracyclines form complexes with zinc in the gastrointestinal tract, which can reduce absorption of both the tetracycline and zinc when taken at the same time ( 3046 , 4945 ). Taking zinc sulfate 200 mg with tetracycline reduces absorption of the antibiotic by 30% to 40% ( 11615 ). Demeclocycline and minocycline cause a similar interaction ( 4945 ). However, doxycycline does not seem to interact significantly with zinc ( 11615 ). Advise patients to take tetracyclines at least 2 hours before, or 4-6 hours after, zinc supplements to avoid any interactions. more</data><data key="mechanism_text">General Zinc is a biologically essential trace element and is the second most abundant trace element in the body. The total body content is about 2 grams ( 8621 ). It is a cofactor in many biological processes including DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. About 30% of cellular zinc is found within the nucleus. A large number of proteins that play a role in the regulation of gene expression are thought to contain zinc ( 8619 ). Zinc also plays a role in immune function, wound healing, reproduction, growth and development, behavior and learning, taste and smell, blood clotting, thyroid hormone function, and insulin action ( 331 ). Zinc is found in more than 300 enzymes ( 8619 ). About 300 enzymes depend on zinc as a catalyst ( 7135 , 96074 ). Zinc is also required in hepatic synthesis of retinol binding protein, the transport protein of vitamin A ( 8630 ). Without adequate zinc, symptoms of vitamin A deficiency can appear, despite vitamin A supplementation ( 8630 ). Meat, seafood, dairy products, nuts, legumes, and whole grains contain relatively high concentrations of zinc ( 331 ). Many breakfast cereals are fortified with zinc ( 7135 ). Zinc oxide and zinc sulfate are typically used to fortify wheat products ( 10668 ). Zinc deficiency is characterized by growth retardation, low insulin levels, reduced levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, anorexia, mental lethargy, irritability, low sperm count, generalized hair loss, rough and dry skin, skin lesions, slow wound healing, decreased thyroid function, delayed onset of puberty, poor sense of smell and taste, diarrhea, and nausea ( 8619 ). Although zinc deficiency and tri-iodothyronine (T3) have complementary roles in growth and development, growth failure in zinc deficiency does not seem to be the result of impaired T3 function ( 8619 ). Zinc deficiency is not uncommon worldwide, but deficiency is rare in the US; most diets provide more than the recommended dietary allowance ( 8632 ). Moderate zinc deficiency is associated with malabsorption syndromes, alcoholism, chronic renal disease, and chronic debilitating diseases ( 8621 ). Zinc levels also appear to be lower in acute attacks of paranoid schizophrenia ( 12584 ). There is no reliable test in clinical use to determine zinc deficiency. Serum or plasma zinc on its own is neither sensitive nor specific. It seems to be useful to measure zinc status on a population basis, but is an inaccurate measure in individuals, particularly in people with chronic infections or inflammatory conditions ( 8625 ). The most reliable method for diagnosing marginal zinc deficiency is a positive response to zinc supplementation and improvement in subtle symptoms such as growth retardation or altered ability to taste or smell ( 8621 ). Anti-gingivitis effects Most clinical evidence shows that using zinc toothpaste or mouthwash alone or in combination with triclosan can prevent plaque accumulation, gingivitis, or the formation of calculus ( 6523 , 6524 , 6525 , 6526 , 6527 , 6528 , 6529 , 87418 , 87507 ). It is possible that this is due to antimicrobial effects of zinc ( 87012 , 87217 ). Anti-inflammatory effects It is hypothesized that low levels of plasma zinc may be one of the nonspecific features of inflammation ( 87440 ). In two meta-analyses, zinc supplementation reduced inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), high-sensitivity (hs) CRP, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6, malondialdehyde, and neutrophils ( 104820 , 104952 ). In healthy elderly individuals, zinc has been shown to decrease inflammatory biomarkers for atherosclerosis, including hsCRP, macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), malondialdehyde and hydroxyalkenals (MDA+HAE) ( 87214 , 96073 ). Also, zinc supplementation has been shown to decrease inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP in hemodialysis patients ( 87171 ). In addition, zinc supplementation reduces serum immunoglobulins and increases serum albumin, which appears to be associated with reduced joint paint, increased mobility, and decreased joint swelling in patients with psoriatic arthritis ( 6515 ). However, taking zinc orally does not seem to help treat rheumatoid arthritis ( 6517 , 6518 , 6519 , 87406 ). Topical zinc might be effective for treating acne ( 819 , 820 , 2687 , 2688 ) due to anti-inflammatory activity resulting from inhibition of polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis induced by decreased granulocyte zinc levels ( 104056 ). Anti-ulcer effects Taking zinc orally seems to help treat and prevent peptic ulcers in clinical research ( 6588 , 6589 , 6590 , 6591 , 87097 , 87285 ). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, in human research, the antiulcer effects of zinc were suggested to be due to inhibition of gastric secretion as opposed to interactions on parietal cell receptors ( 87478 ). Antidiabetic effects Zinc has been shown to decrease blood glucose and increase insulin levels in human studies ( 86933 , 87520 ), but the mechanism of these effects is unclear. There is some evidence that zinc can increase glucose transport into cells and potentiate insulin-induced glucose transport, possibly by affecting the insulin intracellular signaling (second messenger system) pathway ( 8620 ). Zinc has also been shown to increase serum levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 by 30% and improve glucose tolerance ( 8624 ). Additionally, some animal research shows that zinc can prevent renal oxidative and inflammatory damage due to hyperglycemia in a rat model of diabetes, possibly via induced expression of metallothionein and suppressed connective tissue growth factor ( 87161 ). These results suggest that zinc's antidiabetic effects may be explained by antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Preliminary research also shows that some patients with type 2 diabetes are zinc deficient, possibly as a result of altered zinc metabolism ( 6531 , 6532 ). Whether zinc deficiency is involved in the development of insulin resistance is unknown. In type 1 diabetes with zinc deficiency, zinc supplementation might reduce lipid peroxidation ( 6533 ). Antiviral effects The mechanism for the effect of zinc on the common cold is unclear. It does not influence interleukin-8 in nasal secretions, suggesting that zinc does not affect the immune response to colds ( 10783 , 10784 ). Zinc can inhibit rhinovirus replication in vitro, but it is unclear whether this happens in vivo ( 10783 , 10784 , 18216 ). The rhinovirus replicates in the nasal mucosa, and some researchers question whether orally administered zinc produces sufficient levels in nasal tissues and secretions to inhibit viral replication ( 8628 , 8629 ). The amount of available ionized zinc varies with different formulations and might influence the effectiveness of zinc for the common cold ( 336 , 340 ). The addition of flavoring agents such as citric acid, mannitol, or sorbitol to zinc gluconate lozenge preparations decreases the extent of zinc ionization, while the addition of glycine to zinc gluconate lozenges does not ( 300 ). Zinc ions might also have effects against other viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes virus ( 6538 , 6539 , 6541 , 18216 ). In vitro research also shows that high intracellular zinc levels might stop replication of SARS-CoV-2, and zinc is also reported to have a synergistic effect with antivirals ( 106903 ). Biliary effects Zinc is thought to be a cofactor for enzymes involved in the metabolism of bilirubin. It has been shown to reduce serum bilirubin levels in animals ( 104814 ). Dermatologic effects Clinical research suggests that zinc has beneficial effects on the skin when used orally or topically. For example, oral zinc can improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory activity ( 104056 , 106233 ) and its ability to decrease skin sebum secretion ( 819 , 87275 , 87378 , 106233 ). Some research also suggests that zinc has antimicrobial activity against Cutibacterium acnes ( 106233 ). Topical zinc, along with other antioxidants, appears to improve the look of aging skin ( 6155 ). Fertility effects Male fertility appears to be influenced by zinc ( 6573 , 6574 , 6575 , 6576 ). Infertile males have lower seminal plasma zinc, with normal or reduced blood zinc ( 6575 , 6577 ). Clinical research suggests that short-term dietary zinc depletion results in reduced serum testosterone concentrations, seminal volume, and total seminal zinc loss per ejaculate ( 6576 ). Supplementation with zinc improves sperm parameters in men with reduced sperm mobility ( 6578 ). However, excess zinc might reduce sperm motility ( 6573 ). In male cigarette smokers with infertility, supplementation with zinc improved sperm quality, possibly by reducing testicular accumulation of cadmium induced by cigarette smoking ( 86915 ). In infertile men, zinc improved total sperm count ( 9334 , 87430 ). Some of the benefits of zinc on fertility may be due to hormonal effects. For example, in human research, zinc increased serum testosterone or dihydrotestosterone levels in some ( 6708 , 87430 ), but not all ( 6569 , 87095 ) studies. Immunomodulating effects Zinc is important for neutrophil, natural killer cell, and T-lymphocyte function ( 6551 ). Even mild zinc deficiency might adversely affect T-cell functions ( 6552 ). Interestingly, high-dose zinc supplementation, 20 times the RDA, can have a negative effect similar to deficiency on immune function ( 8625 ). In human research, zinc decreased levels of the suppressor T cells and increased the ratio of helper to suppressor cells ( 6578 , 87156 ). Zinc, alone or with other micronutrients, has been shown to affect numbers of other CD(+) cells and other lymphocytes, and both increase an decrease levels of cytokines ( 824 , 6555 , 6566 , 6578 , 6596 , 10809 , 71430 , 86910 , 87065 )( 87115 , 87140 , 87246 , 87317 , 87414 , 87453 , 87514 ). In children with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-induced diarrhea, zinc has been shown to modulate the innate immune system, as evidenced by an increase in phagocytic activity, a decrease in oxidative burst activity, and an increase in the ratio of naïve to memory T cells ( 87208 ). Also, in children with zinc deficiency, daily zinc supplementation seems to increase plasma levels of E. coli-specific IgG ( 109780 ). In healthy elderly individuals, zinc supplementation enhanced natural killer cell activity ( 87273 ); however, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, zinc decreased natural killer cell activity ( 6915 ). Plasma zinc levels are low in people with HIV infection, but this appears to be a marker of disease progression rather than a treatable cause of progression. Some evidence suggests that zinc supplementation might increase disease progression and mortality in HIV infected patients, but other evidence suggests that avoiding zinc deficiency might allow normal or improved immune function, particularly T-lymphocyte mediated cellular immunity. It also might inhibit susceptibility of T-lymphocytes to apoptosis ( 8625 ). More research is needed to tell if zinc should be avoided or prescribed for zinc deficiency in HIV disease. Plasma levels of zinc are also lower in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). For over 30 years, researchers have been trying to determine the role of zinc in the pathogenesis of MS. Some preliminary clinical research found that zinc levels are reduced during an MS exacerbation and normalize during a remission. However, to date, no clinical research has shown zinc supplementation to be beneficial in patients with MS ( 97137 ). Lipid metabolizing effects Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a zinc-deficiency disorder characterized by low plasma levels of zinc and decreased activity of the zinc-dependent enzyme alkaline phosphatase. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase helps regulate lipid absorption ( 90933 ). In patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica, zinc supplementation seems to help regulate linoleic acid and serum lipoprotein metabolism ( 2689 ). Preliminary clinical research suggests that taking zinc sulfate reduces serum cholesterol in patients with coronary artery disease ( 87299 ). However, in other clinical research, zinc has had mixed effects. For example, in individuals with low baseline cholesterol levels, zinc resulted in increased total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels and lacked an effect on high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels ( 86953 ). In other human research, zinc did not affect total cholesterol levels, but resulted in decreased LDL-cholesterol, and had mixed effects on HDL-cholesterol types, with increased HDL2 and a slight decrease in HDL3 ( 87306 ). The mixed effect of zinc on these parameters may be due to dosing, the age and/or sex of the participant, or baseline zinc and/or plasma lipid levels ( 87193 ). Neurologic effects There is interest in using zinc for various neurological conditions. The role of zinc in Alzheimer disease might be both protective and causative. Laboratory studies suggest that zinc might contribute to aggregation of amyloid beta peptide, but protect against subsequent neurotoxicity as an antioxidant ( 6510 , 6511 , 6512 ). Zinc levels and zinc intake appear to be reduced in some people with depression ( 6562 , 90227 , 97139 ). In the human brain, zinc is believed to play a role in the hippocampus in communication between neurons ( 90221 , 97139 ). Zinc is also believed to potentiate the activity of some antidepressants ( 90221 ). Some clinical evidence shows that taking zinc along with antidepressant treatment improves depression scores in patients diagnosed with major depression better than antidepressant alone ( 86985 , 90221 ). Ocular effects Zinc plays a key role in the maintenance of vision. It is present in high concentrations in the eye, particularly in the retina and choroid. Zinc deficiency can alter vision, and severe deficiency causes changes in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Zinc interacts with taurine and vitamin A in the retina, modifies plasma membranes in the photoreceptors, regulates the light-rhodopsin reaction within the photoreceptor, modulates synaptic transmission, and serves as an antioxidant in both the RPE and retina. It seems to slow the progression of some degenerative retinal diseases ( 8621 ). Topically, zinc sulfate ophthalmic solution acts as a mild astringent, precipitating protein and clearing mucus from the outer surface of the eye ( 15 ). Prostate cancer effects In some clinical research, taking zinc in combination with other vitamins and minerals reduces the risk of prostate cancer ( 14135 ). Also, in laboratory research, zinc has been shown to inhibit prostate carcinoma cell growth ( 86909 ). However, other evidence, based on population research, suggests that zinc might adversely affect prostate cancer risk ( 10306 , 15607 ). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. It has been shown that zinc levels appear to decrease in the prostate tissue and prostatic fluid in men with prostatic carcinoma ( 6909 , 6910 ). Also, laboratory research suggests that in malignant prostate cells, zinc up-regulated the expression of certain metallothionein (MT)-1 enzymes, as well as genes implicated in oncogenic pathways, such as Fos, Akt1, Jak3, and PI3K ( 87152 ). Laboratory research also suggests that zinc induced apoptosis ( 87490 ). Other potential mechanisms of action, as shown in laboratory research, include the role of zinc in the regulation of zinc transporters such as LIV-1 (ZUP6) ( 87267 ). Sickle cell effects People with sickle cell disease (SCD) are commonly zinc deficient. Zinc deficiency in SCD might cause a cell-mediated immune disorder, and increase the risk of infection in SCD. Some researchers think zinc deficiency leads to increased production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin-1 (IL-1) which might result in vaso-occlusive pain. This may explain the benefit of zinc supplementation in some patients with SCD ( 8627 ). Skeletal effects There is interest in using zinc for preventing osteoporosis. Zinc seems to be involved in the mineralization of bone. In animal models, zinc deficiency has been linked to abnormal bone formation. In humans, increased zinc content in bone appears to be associated with increased bone strength ( 14410 ). In people with osteoporosis, urinary zinc excretion is increased, possibly as a result of bone resorption ( 6918 ). Serum zinc levels and zinc intake seem to be lower in people with osteoporosis ( 6918 , 6920 , 14410 ). However, moderately high dietary zinc intake (53 mg per day) seems to increase magnesium excretion without affecting copper metabolism in postmenopausal adults ( 12424 ). Supplementation with high doses of zinc, 142 mg/day, also appears to decrease magnesium absorption and magnesium balance in healthy adult males ( 9624 ). This might adversely affect bone health. Zinc may compete with magnesium for ion exchange transport in the intestine ( 12424 ). More research on the clinical importance of these observations is needed. Wilson disease Wilson disease is a condition in which too much copper accumulates in vital organs, including the liver and brain. Zinc blocks copper absorption and increases copper elimination in the stool of people with Wilson disease ( 2692 ). Wound-healing effects For aiding in wound healing, topical zinc might enhance re-epithelialization and collagen synthesis, decrease inflammation, and inhibit bacterial growth ( 2699 ).</data><data key="source_url">https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/Data/ProMonographs/Zinc</data><data key="scientific_name">atomic number 30, Zinc, Zn</data><data key="name">Zinc</data><data key="overview_text">Zinc is a mineral and an essential nutrient for plants and animals. Zinc deficiency can result in short stature, hypogonadism, reduced ability to taste food, and anorexia. Because the human body does not store excess zinc, an adequate supply must be regularly consumed as part of the diet. Common dietary sources of zinc include red meat, poultry, and fish. Low-income countries in which these foods are not readily available may have a higher prevalence of zinc deficiency.</data><data key="effectiveness_text">Expand All | Collapse All Effective Zinc deficiency. Orally or intravenously, zinc is effective for treating and preventing zinc deficiency. Taking zinc orally or intravenously prevents and treats zinc deficiency ( 2619 ). However, routine zinc supplementation is not recommended ( 403 ). Zinc deficiency requiring supplementation may occur in patients with severe diarrhea, malabsorption syndromes, liver cirrhosis, and alcoholism; after major surgery, renal failure, and dialysis; or during long-term administration of total parenteral nutrition ( 3900 , 24321 ). Zinc supplementation (136 mg of elemental zinc per day) in patients with cirrhosis and zinc deficiency seems to improve liver function and glucose tolerance, possibly by increasing insulin-like growth factor ( 8624 , 87520 ). more Likely Effective Diarrhea. Oral zinc reduces duration and severity of acute diarrhea in malnourished children. Doses of 5-20 mg seem to be effective, while 5-10 mg daily is less likely to cause vomiting. Most research, including meta-analyses and over 30 clinical trials, show that taking zinc orally reduces the duration and severity of acute and persistent diarrhea in malnourished or zinc-deficient children, but not in well-nourished children ( 87236,96074). Most studies have been conducted in Bangladesh and India, so it is unclear if these findings are generalizable to other geographic locations. The most comprehensive meta-analysis of clinical studies in children older than 6 months shows that zinc supplementation reduces the duration of acute diarrhea by about 11 hours and the duration of persistent diarrhea by about 16 hours when compared with placebo. However, zinc does not seem to reduce the duration of acute diarrhea in children younger than 6 months. Zinc supplementation seems to have the greatest benefit in children with clear malnutrition and diarrhea. In these children, zinc reduces diarrhea duration by about 26 hours and reduces the risk of diarrhea persisting through days 3, 5, and 7 by 18% to 24% when compared with placebo. There was no clear benefit of using zinc in a specific dose or salt form. The most common dose of zinc was 20 mg daily and salt forms included zinc sulfate, gluconate, and acetate ( 96074 ). Also, a large clinical trial in children with acute diarrhea shows that taking zinc 5 or 10 mg daily for 14 days is non-inferior to taking 20 mg. Furthermore, zinc 5 or 10 mg results in a respective 29% and 19% lower risk of vomiting within the first 30 minutes when compared with zinc 20 mg ( 104045 ). It's unclear whether zinc supplementation reduces mortality in children with diarrhea. A meta-analysis of clinical research in children under the age of five years shows that supplementation with zinc reduces the risk of mortality from diarrhea by 15% when compared with either placebo, other vitamin and/or mineral supplementation, or no supplementation ( 106239 ). However, many studies were conducted in hospitals where rates of mortality are low and were not adequately powered to determine whether zinc has an effect on mortality in children with acute diarrhea ( 87210 , 96074 , 106239 ). more Wilson disease. Taking zinc orally improves symptoms of this condition. Zinc acetate (Galzin) is an FDA-approved orphan drug for treating this condition. Zinc blocks copper absorption and increases copper elimination in the stool of people with Wilson disease ( 2692 , 2693 , 87327 ). Small clinical studies suggest that taking zinc after 8 weeks of treatment with tetrathiomolybdate alone can improve Kayser-Fleischer rings, urine copper levels, and neurological symptoms for up to 6 years post-treatment ( 63588 , 87491 ). more Possibly Effective Acne. Orally, zinc might help to reduce symptoms of acne. However, it's unclear how oral zinc compares to conventional acne treatments. Topical zinc doesn't seem to be beneficial if used alone. Observational research has found that people with acne seem to have lower zinc levels in the serum and skin ( 104056 ). A meta-analysis of small, low quality clinical trials suggests that taking zinc sulfate or zinc gluconate 137-300 mg 2-3 times daily by mouth can modestly improve acne when compared with placebo ( 104056 ). However, not all individual trials show benefit ( 87002 , 104056 ). So far, it is not clear how oral zinc compares to other treatments. Trials comparing zinc sulfate with various tetracyclines have yielded conflicting results ( 6505 , 6506 , 86946 , 106233 ). One large open-label clinical trial shows that taking zinc sulfate 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks is at least as effective as lymecycline 300 mg daily for reducing acne severity. Quality of life related to acne was modestly improved in the patients using zinc sulfate ( 106233 ). However, in another clinical trial, a 3-month treatment of oral zinc gluconate 30 mg daily reduced the number of acne lesions from baseline, but was not as effective as minocycline ( 86946 ). When applied topically, clinical research shows that zinc does not help treat acne when compared with placebo ( 87297 , 104056 ). However, when used in combination with erythromycin, topical zinc seems to result in improvement ( 819 , 820 , 2687 , 2688 ). more Acrodermatitis enteropathica. Oral zinc seems to improve symptoms of this rare genetic disorder. Multiple case reports have found that taking oral zinc seems to help improve symptoms of acrodermatitis enteropathica, a rare disorder ( 821 , 2689 , 2690 , 2691 ). One case report in a female with necrolytic acral erythema and hepatitis C suggests that adding oral zinc sulfate 225 mg twice daily to interferon alfa-2b for 6 months contributed to resolving all lesions. Necrolytic acral erythema is categorized in the family of necrolytic erythemas that includes acrodermatitis enteropathica ( 6192 ). more Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral zinc, especially in combination with antioxidant vitamins, seems to slow the progression of AMD. Clinical research shows that taking elemental zinc 80 mg plus vitamin C 500 mg, vitamin E 400 IU, and beta-carotene 15 mg daily reduces the odds of progression to advanced AMD by 28%. In patients with more severe AMD, this combination reduced the odds of progression to advanced AMD by 34%. This combination also reduced the odds of visual acuity loss by 27% in patients with severe AMD ( 7303 , 11326 ). However, there is contradictory evidence about the effects of zinc plus antioxidants on visual acuity loss or the progression to advanced AMD in low-risk patients with AMD ( 6583 , 6584 , 7303 ). Some clinical evidence shows that, when taken without antioxidant vitamins, zinc supplementation does not slow the progression of existing AMD ( 6580 , 90069 ). However, a subgroup analysis of results from a large clinical trial that included patients with intermediate or advanced AMD suggests that the effect of zinc on AMD progression might vary depending on a patient's genetic predisposition. Complement factor H (CFH) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) are two genes for which specific variations (i.e., risk alleles) have been associated with an increased risk of AMD. Results from the retrospective subgroup analysis suggest that zinc supplementation may DECREASE the progression of AMD in patients with ARMS2 risk alleles and INCREASE the progression of AMD in patients with CFH risk alleles ( 90193 ). However, some experts question the results from this analysis due to the retrospective nature of the study ( 93045 ). Another retrospective analysis of similar data found that only zinc plus antioxidants, but not zinc alone, was beneficial for slowing the progression of AMD, regardless of the patient's genotype ( 93046 ). Consequently, the American Academy of Ophthalmology does not currently recommend routine genetic screening to determine which patients would benefit from zinc, antioxidants, or the combination. Instead, patients with intermediate or advanced AMD are recommended to take an antioxidant and zinc supplement similar to those used in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) ( 93047 ). Large scale population studies suggest that increasing dietary intake of zinc might reduce the risk of developing AMD ( 6579 , 14257 ). more Child growth. Oral zinc seems to increase growth when taken by children and improve infant growth in the first year of life when taken by pregnant adults. A meta-analysis of 8 clinical studies in healthy children over 2 years old shows that taking supplemental zinc 5-15 mg daily for 6-56 weeks modestly increases height and weight when compared with placebo. This analysis also shows that taking zinc may improve height for age, but not weight for age when compared with placebo ( 112474 ). Most of these studies were conducted in developing countries; results may not apply elsewhere. Another clinical study in pregnant adults in Peru shows that taking zinc 15 mg daily in addition to iron and folic acid, starting during the first or second trimester and continuing up to one month after delivery, modestly improves growth measures of infants at one year when compared with taking iron and folic acid alone. Improved growth measures include body weight, calf and chest circumference, and calf muscle area ( 87130 ). more Common cold. Oral zinc seems to help treat cold symptoms in adults. However, it is unclear if zinc is beneficial for common cold prevention. Using zinc oral lozenges seems to be beneficial in helping TREAT the common cold in adults. The majority of clinical trials and analyses of clinical research show a significant decrease in the duration of symptoms of the common cold when adults take zinc gluconate or zinc acetate lozenges providing 9-24 mg of elemental zinc per dose. It is recommended that lozenges be taken every 2 hours while awake, starting within 48 hours of symptom onset for a total daily dose of at least 75 mg in order to attain a mean cold duration reduction of 3 days ( 333 , 334 , 335 , 337 , 6703 , 6705 , 87501 , 92212 , 106902 ). However, not all studies have been positive ( 333 , 338 , 339 , 6522 , 6700 , 87512 ). The reasons for these different findings are not clear, but might be due to differences in zinc formulations and doses and study methodologies. In some cases, flavoring agents such as citric acid, mannitol, and sorbitol might chelate zinc and decrease zinc ionization. Since ionization is thought to be necessary for zinc activity, a decrease in zinc ionization could decrease effectiveness ( 300 , 340 , 6522 ). Some of the positive studies have also been criticized for inadequately blinding the unpleasant, distinctive taste of zinc ( 6522 , 6706 ). Allergy and smoking status do not appear to impact the efficacy of zinc acetate lozenges ( 92212 ). Overall, zinc products may be beneficial for modestly reducing the duration of symptoms of the common cold in adults, but adverse effects such as bad taste and nausea may limit their usefulness ( 18216 ). There is conflicting evidence for the use of oral zinc products to PREVENT colds. Some clinical research suggests that taking zinc prophylactically does not prevent the common cold in adults ( 10780 , 10784 ) or children ( 341 ). However, other clinical research suggests that administering zinc gluconate lozenges can reduce the incidence of colds in children and adolescents ( 10803 , 86972 ). In a meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials with a total of 5446 participants, oral zinc prevented 5 viral upper respiratory tract infections per 100 person months of zinc use when compared with placebo, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 20 ( 106902 ). Intranasal zinc is not recommended for the prevention or treatment of the common cold due to the risk for anosmia. See the Adverse Effects section for more information. Some research shows that zinc nasal spray (as a sulfate, gluconate emulsion, or gluconium gel) reduces the severity and duration of cold symptoms; however, other research has found no effect ( 6471 , 8628 , 8629 , 10247 , 87035 ). Zinc nasal spray does not seem to prevent experimentally-induced colds ( 8628 ). more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While oral zinc does not seem to speed recovery from COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients, an analysis of a small number of studies suggests that oral or intravenous zinc might reduce the risk of death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A small observational study in patients with COVID-19 has found that lower serum zinc levels are associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death, when compared with higher zinc levels ( 105681 ). Another small observational study has found that 96% of patients with confirmed COVID-19 were zinc-deficient based on plasma levels of zinc, and that these patients had lower plasma zinc levels than a group of individuals without COVID-19. However, plasma zinc concentrations were only weakly correlated with length of hospital stay and there was no correlation with morbidity or mortality ( 106236 ). One clinical study in adult outpatients with COVID-19 shows that taking zinc gluconate 50 mg daily at bedtime, alone or with vitamin C (ascorbic acid) 8000 mg daily, for 10 days does not reduce symptom severity when compared with standard care ( 104450 ). This study was terminated prior to complete enrollment due to a lack of effect with zinc and/or vitamin C supplementation. Limitations of this study include a lack of placebo control and blinding. Zinc supplementation also does not appear to enhance the clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Taking zinc sulfate 220 mg twice daily during a 6-day course of hydroxychloroquine does not improve the clinical recovery rate, reduce the mortality rate, or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation when compared with hydroxychloroquine alone ( 104818 ). Other research has evaluated zinc in hospitalized patients. Multiple meta-analyses of small and low-quality clinical studies, including randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies, involving hospitalized patients with COVID-19 shows that supplementation with oral or intravenous zinc is associated with a 29% to 43% reduction in the odds of in-hospital mortality when compared with control ( 109451 , 110631 ). However, in one meta-analysis, the odds of 30-day mortality were not different between groups ( 110631 ). These meta-analyses did not elevate the most effective form, dose, frequency, or duration of zinc supplementation ( 109451 , 110631 ). Additionally, a retrospective study in adults admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 has found that those who received oral zinc sulfate, 220 mg daily for a median of 11 days, had a lower 30-day mortality rate when compared with those who did not receive zinc. However, there was no difference in hospital length of stay or in-hospital mortality ( 106903 ). more Depression. Oral zinc seems to be beneficial when used in combination with antidepressant treatments. Population research has found that higher zinc levels and higher dietary intake of zinc are associated with a 28% lower incidence of depression ( 90227 , 97139 , 104057 ). Oral zinc seems to be beneficial as an adjunct therapy in depression. A meta-analysis of small, low-quality studies in patients with major depression shows that taking zinc in addition to antidepressant therapy is associated with modestly improved depression symptoms when compared with antidepressant therapy alone ( 104044 ). Clinical studies used zinc doses of 7-25 mg daily for up to 12 weeks ( 86985 , 90221 , 104044 ). One small clinical study also shows that adding zinc to imipramine therapy might improve depression that was previously resistant to antidepressant treatment ( 87158 ). One clinical guideline also provisionally recommends use of zinc 25 mg elemental orally daily to treat patients with depression based on low-quality evidence. This guideline recommends use of chelated or picolinate zinc products over other forms of zinc ( 110318 ). more Diabetes. Oral zinc might modestly improve glycemic control in some patients. A meta-analysis of 12 clinical studies in patients with diabetes shows that taking zinc supplements reduces fasting blood glucose by up to 20 mg/dL and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.35% when compared with control. However, when only high quality studies were included, the reduction in fasting blood glucose dropped to 12 mg/dL. Zinc seems to only have glycemic benefit in patients living in the Eastern hemisphere, and not the Western hemisphere. Also, glucose reduction seems to be higher with inorganic zinc formulations at doses of at least 30 mg daily taken for at least one month ( 104080 ). Zinc has also been evaluated for improving lipid parameters in patients with diabetes. A meta-analysis of nine studies in patients with diabetes shows that taking zinc reduces triglycerides by 17 mg/dL, but does not seem to affect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo ( 104041 ). The findings from these meta-analyses are limited by the high heterogeneity and small size of the included studies. Zinc has also been studied for gestational diabetes. Some clinical research in patients with gestational diabetes shows that taking zinc gluconate for 6 weeks, starting at 24-28 weeks' gestation, reduces fasting plasma glucose levels by about 10% and improves insulin resistance by 14% when compared to baseline ( 96072 ). However, taking zinc gluconate does not reduce the need for caesarean section or insulin therapy, or improve infant outcomes, such as size or health at birth, in these patients ( 96073 ). more Diaper rash. Topical and oral zinc seem to reduce the incidence and severity of diaper rash in infants. Clinical research shows that administering oral zinc gluconate 10 mg daily for 4 months can reduce the incidence of diaper rash in infants when compared with placebo ( 87281 ). Other clinical research shows that applying 47% zinc oxide paste to affected areas for 5 days can improve the healing of diaper rash. However, the effect of zinc oxide paste is inferior to eosin 2% solution ( 86918 ). more Gingivitis. Topical zinc seems to reduce the development of gingivitis. While some clinical research shows that zinc, in combination with triclosan, does not prevent plaque and gingivitis ( 24093 , 87020 ), most clinical research shows that using zinc toothpaste or mouthwash, alone or in combination with triclosan, can prevent plaque accumulation, gingivitis, or the formation of calculus ( 6523 , 6524 , 6525 , 6526 , 6527 , 6528 , 6529 , 87418 , 87507 ). However, most studies used zinc citrate in combination with triclosan, which is not available in the US ( 6523 ). For treating existing plaque, calculus, and gingivitis, some clinical research suggests that using zinc citrate 0.5% toothpaste three times daily for 3 months reduces calculus scores by 14% when compared with placebo ( 87205 ). However, other evidence suggests that stannous fluoride 0.454% toothpaste is more effective than zinc citrate 0.75% toothpaste for reducing plaque levels ( 87136 ). more Halitosis. Oral zinc seems to reduce halitosis when taken as a gum, mouth rinse, or candy. Clinical research shows that chewing zinc-containing gum reduces volatile sulfur compounds and related odor levels when compared with placebo gum in patients with moderate to severe halitosis ( 87538 ). Clinical research also shows that using one of two mouth rinses (Halita, which contains 0.05% chlorhexidine and 0.14% zinc lactate, or Meridol, which contains 0.025% fluoride plus 0.2% zinc lactate) improves breath odor and volatile sulfur compounds by approximately two-fold when compared with mouth rinse containing only 0.05% fluoride or chlorhexidine 0.12% ( 90206 ). Additional clinical research shows that sucking a candy containing abrasive substances and zinc gluconate 0.5% or candy containing abrasive substances plus zinc 0.25% and propolis 1% improves breath malodor two- to three-fold when compared with sucking placebo candy ( 90196 ). more Herpes labialis (cold sores). Topical zinc seems to reduce the severity and duration of cold sores. Applying zinc topically seems to help treat herpes simplex infection ( 6538 , 6539 , 8623 , 11051 ). Zinc sulfate seems to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms in both orolabial and genital herpes ( 6538 , 6539 ). Zinc oxide (0.3%) in combination with glycine cream applied topically every 2 hours to facial and circumoral herpes seems to reduce symptoms such as blistering, soreness, itching, and tingling. It can also reduce the duration of lesions from 6.5 days to 5 days when treatment is begun within 24 hours of onset of symptoms ( 8623 ). A specific combination product containing zinc oxide and L-lysine plus 14 other ingredients (Super Lysine Plus +) also seems to help decrease symptoms and duration of herpes lesions when applied topically every 2 hours ( 11051 ). However, zinc may not be effective for recurrent herpes simplex infections. In one clinical study, applying zinc sulfate 0.0025% or 0.05% solution to affected areas did not reduce the frequency, severity, or duration of herpes episodes when compared with a placebo solution in patients experiencing more than five episodes per year ( 87330 ). more Hypogeusia. Oral zinc might improve taste disturbance and taste acuity in people with hypogeusia of various etiologies. A meta-analysis of low-quality studies in patients with taste disorders that are idiopathic or due to zinc deficiency shows that taking oral zinc modestly improves taste acuity when compared with placebo ( 104055 ). Studies tested zinc gluconate, zinc sulfate, zinc acetate, and zinc-carnosine as Polaprezinc (Promac, Zeria Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), containing 17-68 mg elemental zinc, daily for up to 12 weeks ( 104055 ). Zinc also might improve hypogeusia conditions unrelated to zinc deficiency, such as gustin/carbonic anhydrase VI deficiency, captopril-induced taste disturbances, hypogeusia due to chronic renal failure, and post-traumatic olfactory disorder ( 6543 , 6544 , 104055 ). It also seems be beneficial in radiation-induced dysgeusia. A meta-analysis of three small clinical trials shows that oral zinc reduces the risk of radiation-induced dysgeusia by 28%, but does not improve taste acuity when compared with placebo ( 104043 ). However, patients with hypogeusia from other causes may not benefit. Zinc supplementation does not seem to improve taste perception when compared with placebo in patients with acetazolamide-induced taste dysfunction or chemotherapy-induced taste dysfunction ( 87388 , 90214 ). more Leishmania lesions. Oral zinc and intralesional injections of zinc might improve healing of these lesions. Clinical research shows that taking zinc sulfate 2.5-10 mg/kg orally in three divided doses daily, improves the cure rate of cutaneous leishmania lesions after 45 days when compared with no treatment ( 86935 ). Other clinical research shows that intralesional injections of zinc sulfate 2% solution for 6 weeks improves cure rates of cutaneous leishmania lesions when compared with no treatment ( 6587 ). However, intralesional injections with zinc sulfate solution does not appear to be more effective than intralesional injections of meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime), hypertonic saline, or sodium stibogluconate ( 6587 , 86996 , 87008 ). more Leprosy. Oral zinc seems to be beneficial when used in combination with anti-leprosy drugs. Zinc levels appear to be reduced in people with leprosy. Early clinical research suggests that the addition of zinc improves tolerance of the anti-leprosy drug regimen and might allow for lowering or eliminating steroid doses in erythema nodosum leprosum, a severe form of leprosy ( 6534 , 6535 , 6536 , 6537 ). more Low birth weight. Oral zinc supplementation seems to improve growth in low birth weight infants. Whether oral zinc can improve other outcomes, including mortality, is unclear. Taking oral zinc during pregnancy does not seem to reduce the risk of having a low birth weight infant. While there is some mixed evidence regarding the effects of zinc supplementation on weight gain and length in infants born with low birth weight ( 87172 , 87452 , 90229 ), a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials in preterm or low birth weight infants receiving breastmilk shows that zinc supplementation, typically 5-7 mg daily started at birth and continued for up to 12 months with or without other micronutrients, increases weight by around 380 grams, length by around 3 cm, and head circumference by around 0.6 cm when compared with control ( 109455 ). There is also mixed evidence regarding the effect of zinc supplementation on other outcomes in low birth weight infants. A large clinical trial in full-term, underweight infants aged 1-6 months in developing countries shows that adding zinc to nutritional supplementation reduces the risk of mortality by about 68% when compared with nutritional supplementation not containing zinc ( 8920 ). A small clinical trial in very low birth weight preterm infants born in an industrialized country shows that adding zinc to multivitamin supplementation appears to reduce the occurrence of necrotizing enterocolitis and mortality. However, adding zinc does not appear to prevent late-onset sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or retinopathy of prematurity ( 90229 ). A meta-analysis of these trials and two other studies in low birth weight infants shows that supplementation with zinc reduces the risk of all-cause mortality by 52% when compared with either placebo, other vitamin and/or mineral supplementation, or no supplementation ( 106239 ). Another small clinical study in low birth weight and preterm infants born in a developing country shows that zinc supplementation seems to improve alertness and attention when compared with placebo ( 97140 ). However, a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials in preterm or low birth weight infants receiving breastmilk shows that zinc supplementation, typically 5-7 mg daily started at birth and continued for up to 12 months with or without other micronutrients, does not improve mental or psychomotor development or reduce the risk of mortality, hospitalization, acute respiratory infection, or sepsis when compared with control ( 109455 ). Some of these discrepant findings may be due to differences in patient populations (hospitalized, non-hospitalized), milk sources (breastfed, formula-fed, or both), and duration of follow-up. The effect of zinc intake or supplementation during pregnancy has also been evaluated. Population research has found that low dietary intake of zinc during pregnancy is associated with low birth weight in infants; similarly, zinc supplementation is associated with increased infant weight at birth ( 87471 , 105678 ). However, a meta-analysis and a large clinical study show that zinc supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of having a low birth weight infant ( 97142 , 105679 ). Reasons for the discrepancies may be due to differing zinc status prior to supplementation. Also, numerous factors contribute to the risk of low birth weight, which may confound research on the use of zinc supplementation alone. more Peptic ulcers. Oral zinc seems to treat and prevent peptic ulcers. Taking zinc orally seems to help treat and prevent peptic ulcers ( 6588 , 6589 , 6591 ). Some clinical research shows that zinc acexamate improves peptic ulcers when compared with placebo ( 6589 , 87285 ), and seems to be as effective as H2-receptor antagonist drugs ( 6589 , 87533 ). It is not known if other zinc salts are effective. more Pneumonia. Oral zinc might reduce the risk for pneumonia in children, but it doesn't seem to improve symptoms in children that already have pneumonia. A meta-analysis of four clinical studies shows that giving zinc supplements to children, ages 3 months to 5 years living in developing countries, some of whom were undernourished, reduces the risk of pneumonia incidence by 21% when compared with placebo ( 104047 ). Another meta-analysis of clinical research in children under the age of five years shows that supplementation with zinc reduces the risk of pneumonia mortality by 21% when compared with either placebo, other vitamin and/or mineral supplementation, or no supplementation ( 106239 ). The research on TREATING existing pneumonia in children is inconsistent. Most meta-analyses and clinical studies in children ages 2 months to 5 years with severe pneumonia show that taking elemental zinc in addition to antibiotic therapy does not improve symptom resolution or the time to recovery when compared with antibiotic therapy alone. Zinc also does not seem to reduce mortality in these patients ( 87248 , 90197 , 96080 , 98131 , 104042 ). However, two clinical studies in children in the same age group with pneumonia suggest that adding zinc to standard antibiotic therapy improves symptom resolution and decreases hospital stay when compared with placebo ( 11052 , 87242 ). Reasons for these discrepancies are not clear, but may be related to zinc status prior to treatment. more Prematurity. Analyses of clinical studies suggest that oral zinc improves growth in premature infants. Whether zinc improves development or reduces the risk of mortality in these patients is unclear. A meta-analysis of small clinical trials in hospitalized infants born prematurely suggests that receiving enteral zinc supplementation at a dose of up to 10 mg daily reduces mortality and might improve short-term weight gain when compared with placebo ( 105687 ). Another meta-analysis of small clinical studies in preterm infants shows that adding zinc to formula or to a multivitamin seems to modestly increase infant weight and height and improve motor development when compared with control ( 105676 ). A larger meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials in preterm or low birth weight infants receiving breastmilk shows that zinc supplementation, typically 5-7 mg daily started at birth and continued for up to 12 months with or without other micronutrients, increases weight by around 380 grams, length by around 3 cm, and head circumference by around 0.6 cm when compared with control. However, zinc supplementation did not improve mental or psychomotor development or reduce the risk of mortality, hospitalization, acute respiratory infection, or sepsis when compared with control ( 109455 ). These analyses are limited by imprecision as well as a high risk of bias in some of the included studies. Some of the discrepant findings may be due to differences in patient populations (hospitalized, non-hospitalized), milk sources (breastfed, formula-fed, or both), and duration of follow-up. more Pressure ulcers. Topical zinc paste seems to work as a skin barrier and improve pressure ulcer healing. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study shows that applying zinc oxide paste to pressure ulcers daily for 8 weeks reduces necrotic tissue and decreases the surface area of skin pressure ulcers similarly to using a topical streptokinase-streptodornase product (Varidase) ( 87331 ). Other small clinical studies show that applying zinc oxide paste to pressure ulcers daily for 8-12 weeks improves healing similarly to a hydrocolloid dressing (Duoderm) ( 87181 ) or a specific barrier film product (Cavilon No Sting Barrier Film) ( 87017 ). Oral zinc has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for the treatment of grade II-IV pressure ulcers. Two small clinical studies in hospitalized patients shows that administering an oral nutritional supplement enriched with zinc, L-arginine, and vitamin C improves ulcer healing when compared with a standard diet ( 31953 , 87173 ). Also, clinical research in patients living in long-term care facilities shows that taking an oral nutritional supplement enriched in protein, zinc, L-arginine, and vitamin C daily for 9 weeks reduces ulcer area and decreases oozing when compared to baseline ( 32045 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Sickle cell disease. Oral zinc seems to improve symptoms of sickle cell disease in patients with zinc deficiency. Taking zinc orally seems to help reduce symptoms of sickle cell disease in people with zinc deficiency ( 6594 , 6595 , 6596 , 8626 , 87343 ). Taking zinc supplements also seems to decrease the occurrence rate of sickle-cell crises and infections ( 6594 , 6596 , 90228 ). Additionally, zinc might reduce the number of hospitalizations for sickle cell crises, although the severity of the crises that do develop is not necessarily decreased by taking zinc supplements ( 6594 , 6596 ). In prepubertal children and adolescents with homozygous sickle cell disease, taking zinc seems to improve growth, height, and weight gain ( 8626 , 87403 ). more Warts. Oral and topical zinc seem to improve the cure rate of cutaneous warts. A small clinical study suggests that applying zinc sulfate 10% solution three times daily for 4 weeks improves plane warts, but not common warts, when compared with distilled water ( 87094 ). Another small clinical study suggests that applying topical zinc oxide 20% ointment twice daily for up to 3 months seems to have a similar cure rate as ointment containing salicylic acid 15% with lactic acid 15% ( 87082 ). Taking zinc orally may also be effective in treating warts ( 87227 ). A meta-analysis of low quality clinical studies shows that taking zinc sulfate orally improves the odds of curing cutaneous warts nearly 17-fold when compared with respective controls ( 87227 ). Preliminary clinical research in adults treated with cryotherapy for anogenital warts shows that taking zinc gluconate 30 mg orally three times daily for 2 months does not reduce the number of warts when compared with placebo ( 111445 ). more Possibly Ineffective Alopecia areata. Oral zinc does not seem to improve symptoms of this condition. Although there is preliminary evidence that suggests zinc in combination with biotin might be helpful for alopecia areata ( 6932 ), most studies indicate that zinc is not effective for alopecia areata, alopecia totalis, or alopecia universalis ( 6931 , 6932 ). more Cystic fibrosis. Oral zinc does not improve cystic fibrosis symptoms or progression. Clinical research shows that taking supplements providing 30-90 mg of elemental zinc for 6 weeks to one year does not improve lung function when compared with placebo in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis ( 87066 , 87113 , 96079 ). One clinical study also shows that taking elemental zinc for one year does not reduce the number of days requiring oral or intravenous antibiotics for pulmonary infections ( 96079 ). However, one study shows that taking zinc can reduce the number of days of oral antibiotic use when compared with placebo ( 87113 ). more HIV/AIDS. Oral zinc does not seem to improve outcomes in patients with HIV. Clinical research in adult HIV patients with normal or low zinc levels shows that taking elemental zinc 12-15 mg daily orally for 18 months along with antiretroviral therapy does not improve viral load, CD4/8 counts, or mortality when compared with placebo ( 87036 , 87216 , 105686 ). In children with HIV-1, clinical research shows that administering zinc sulfate, providing 10 mg elemental zinc, daily for 6 months does not improve mortality, viral load, or CD4 counts when compared with placebo ( 82377 ). more HIV/AIDS-related pregnancy complications. Oral zinc does not prevent pregnancy complications related to HIV infection. Adding zinc 25 mg orally during pregnancy does not seem to reduce parent-to-child vertical transmission of HIV, infant mortality, birth weight, or gestational period in HIV-infected females with low zinc levels ( 11054 , 87034 ). Also, one clinical study in HIV-1-infected pregnant patients suggests that supplemental zinc can increase the risk of wasting, as assessed by weight and mid-upper arm circumference, by 170% when compared with placebo ( 87034 ). more HIV/AIDS-related wasting. Oral zinc does not seem to improve HIV-related wasting syndrome. A clinical study in patients with HIV-related wasting syndrome shows that taking zinc orally in combination with vitamins and albendazole does not seem to improve diarrhea or mortality when compared with taking albendazole alone ( 6564 ). more Infant development. Oral zinc does not seem to improve infant mental and psychomotor development. Clinical research, including a meta-analysis of eight studies, shows that giving zinc to infants or children at high risk for zinc deficiency does not improve mental and psychomotor development when compared with placebo ( 87013 , 90209 ). In another meta-analysis of studies in children whose baseline zinc status was not specified, there was no beneficial effect of zinc supplementation on mental or psychomotor development at 6 or 12 months of age ( 104817 ). more Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Oral zinc does not improve symptoms of IBD. Some clinical research shows that taking zinc orally does not seem to help treat IBD ( 6913 , 6915 , 6916 ). more Influenza. Oral zinc does not seem to reduce the risk for influenza. Supplemental zinc seems to improve cell-mediated immune response in elderly people ( 824 ), but it does not seem to have a significant effect on antibody response and incidence of influenza infection after the vaccine ( 6553 , 6563 ). Additionally, zinc supplementation in patients on hemodialysis, who have a high risk of zinc deficiency, does not seem to improve response to influenza vaccine ( 10809 ). Taking zinc supplements orally is unlikely to improve immune function in people without risk factors for zinc deficiency ( 10789 ). However, there is preliminary evidence that suggests zinc along with selenium might reduce the incidence of infections in institutionalized older patients ( 8921 ). more Otitis media. Oral zinc does not prevent otitis media in children. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking elemental zinc 3-70 mg daily for up to 24 months does not prevent the occurrence of ear infections in children from low- or middle-income countries ( 87258 ). more Pre-eclampsia. Oral zinc taken prenatally does not seem to be beneficial for pre-eclampsia prevention. A meta-analysis and a large clinical study show that zinc supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia when compared with placebo ( 97142 , 105679 ). more Prostate cancer. Oral zinc does not reduce the risk for prostate cancer or prostate cancer-related mortality. Some epidemiological research has found an inverse relationship between dietary zinc intake and prostate cancer ( 96075 ). Also some clinical research shows that taking zinc 20 mg in combination with vitamin C 120 mg, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 30 mg, beta-carotene 6 mg, and selenium 100 mcg daily for an average of 8 years might reduce the risk of prostate cancer in men with normal PSA levels; however, it does not seem to be beneficial for reducing the risk of prostate cancer in patients with PSA levels above 3 mcg/L ( 14135 ). However, some evidence raises concern that zinc might actually INCREASE the risk of prostate cancer. A large-scale population study found that taking more than 100 mg of supplemental zinc daily or taking supplemental zinc for 10 or more years doubles the risk of developing prostate cancer ( 10306 ). Another large-scale population study shows that men who take a multivitamin more than seven times per week and who also take a separate zinc supplement have a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer-related mortality ( 15607 ). Despite these studies suggesting the potential for adverse effects of zinc, a meta-analysis of mainly population research has found that there is no association between zinc intake and the risk of prostate cancer ( 96075 ). more Psoriasis. Oral zinc does not reduce the severity of psoriasis symptoms. Zinc epidermal levels are reportedly lower in people with psoriasis ( 6509 ). However, taking zinc orally does not seem to help treat psoriasis ( 6513 , 6514 , 6912 , 87363 ). Zinc supplementation has no effect on the psoriasis area and severity index ( 6513 , 6514 ). more Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oral zinc does not treat symptoms of RA. Multiple clinical studies in patients with RA show that taking zinc orally does not improve function or symptoms when compared with baseline or control ( 6517 , 6518 , 6519 , 87406 ). more Sexual dysfunction. Oral zinc does not improve sexual function in males with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Clinical research shows that zinc supplementation does not improve sexual activity or libido when compared with placebo in males with sexual dysfunction secondary to CKD ( 6708 , 6568 , 87220 , 87386 , 87416 ). In fact, one clinical study shows that taking zinc can decrease the frequency of intercourse by 76% when compared with placebo in patients with CKD-related sexual dysfunction ( 87220 ). more Tinnitus. Oral zinc does not improve severity of tinnitus or reduce tinnitus-related disability. A meta-analysis of three small clinical trials in adults with tinnitus shows that taking elemental zinc 50 mg daily for up to 16 weeks does not improve tinnitus severity, or disability from tinnitus when compared with placebo ( 104051 ). more Likely Ineffective Malaria. Oral zinc does not prevent or treat malaria in undernourished children or pregnant adults in developing countries. A meta-analysis of clinical research in children or pregnant adults shows that taking zinc orally, alone or in combination with other supplements, for does not reduce the risk of malaria parasitemia ( 111444 ). A large multi-country study in zinc-deficient preschool children with acute malaria shows that taking zinc supplements does not affect fever, parasitemia, or hemoglobin when compared with placebo ( 10246 ). An even larger clinical study of over 40,000 children with malaria aged 1-36 months shows that taking zinc 5-10 mg daily orally for approximately 17 months does not reduce mortality when compared with placebo ( 87078 ). Zinc supplements also do not appear to protect against infection by Plasmodium falciparum ( 8638 , 87235 , 86937 ). However, one small study in children with low and high levels of parasitemia shows that taking zinc 10 mg daily for 46 weeks may lower the incidence of fever episodes by 38% and 69%, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 86937 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Age-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with age-related cognitive decline. An epidemiological study based on elderly adults enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) has found that taking zinc may improve cognition in a non-linear manner. Daily doses below 9 mg and 8 mg in males and females, respectively, showed a positive association with cognitive function, but doses above that level showed no association. Additionally, high intake of both zinc and selenium was associated with improved cognition in females, but not in males ( 108446 ). Dietary intake was collected from two patient-reported 24-hour recalls and cognition was only measured once, limiting the validity of these findings. more Alcohol-related liver disease. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with alcoholic-related liver cirrhosis. A small clinical study in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis shows that taking zinc sulfate 600 mg daily for 6 weeks improves liver function, based on increased alkaline phosphatase activity and reduced serum bilirubin, when compared to baseline ( 87325 ). more Anorexia nervosa. Oral zinc seems to improve weight gain in people with anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa might be linked with zinc deficiency. Small clinical trials in adolescents and adults with anorexia nervosa show that oral zinc supplements might help increase weight gain and improve depressive symptoms when compared with placebo ( 6905 , 6906 ). more Arsenic poisoning. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study shows that taking zinc 4 mg in combination with spirulina extract 500 mg daily for 16 weeks can decrease skin manifestations and reduce arsenic levels in the urine and in hair of patients with chronic arsenic poisoning ( 18301 ). more Asthenopia (eye strain). Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A very small clinical study in adults without dry eye disease shows that taking a specific combination product containing zinc 10 mg, L-carnitine 50 mg, elderberry fruit extract 300 mg, currant 100 mg, and Eleutherococcus root 50 mg (Meramirt CM) orally once daily for 1 month improves measures of eye strain and contrast sensitivity when compared to baseline. Improvements in these measures were lacking in the control group ( 111295 ). Statistical comparison between the two groups was not reported. It is unclear if these effects are due to zinc, other ingredients, or the combination. more Athletic performance. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A very small clinical study in sleep-deprived recreational athletes shows that taking a combination of zinc 90 mg, magnesium 1350 mg, and vitamin B6 31.5 mg orally for 3 nights at bedtime does not improve grip strength, squat, or bench press performance when compared with placebo ( 113655 ). more Atopic dermatitis (eczema). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for alleviating eczema in children. A small clinical study in children with eczema shows that taking zinc sulfate 185.4 mg orally daily for 8 weeks does not appear to improve the surface area affected and degree of erythema, symptom scores of itch and sleep disturbance, or topical steroid use when compared with placebo. Also, plasma zinc levels appear to be normal in children with eczema ( 6911 ). more Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Oral zinc might improve certain symptoms in children with ADHD. Observational research has found that lower serum zinc levels are both more prevalent in children with ADHD and are linked to worsened response to stimulant therapy ( 9965 , 9966 , 9967 ). Based on this evidence, there is some interest in using zinc to improve symptoms in children with ADHD. A meta-analysis of six small clinical trials shows that although taking zinc modestly improves overall symptoms of ADHD when compared with placebo, there is no effect on hyperactivity or inattention when these outcomes are examined separately. The sub-analyses conducted for these two separate outcomes included only 3 studies. Most, but not all, of the included studies were conducted in children also receiving methylphenidate treatment ( 106240 ). Elemental zinc, usually as sulfate, was typically used in doses of 10-40 mg daily for 6-12 weeks ( 11350 , 12060 , 106240 ). There is some evidence that zinc could be most helpful in children with a high body mass index (BMI), low zinc levels, and low free fatty acid levels ( 11350 ). It is unclear if zinc is beneficial in children who are not already taking stimulant medications. One clinical guideline also provisionally recommends against use of oral zinc to treat patient with ADHD based on low-quality evidence ( 110318 ). more Autism spectrum disorder. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in children with autism spectrum disorder. One small clinical study conducted in children with autism spectrum disorder shows that taking zinc 15-30 mg orally, alone or as add-on therapy to amphetamine, does not improve attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms when compared with placebo ( 98711 ). However, the optimal mg/kg dose of amphetamine was shown to be 37% lower for those children also taking zinc 15 mg twice daily when compared with those taking placebo ( 98711 ). more Autoimmune thyroiditis. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in children with autoimmune thyroiditis. A small clinical study in children aged 3-18 years with autoimmune thyroiditis shows that taking zinc acetate 25 mg daily in addition to standard therapy for 12 weeks does not change thyroid auto-antibody levels, thyroid function tests, or oxidative stress markers when compared with standard therapy alone. However, subjects taking zinc did not require escalation in levothyroxine doses when compared with the control group control group, which did require levothyroxine dose escalation ( 113661 ). more Behcet disease. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with Behcet disease. A small clinical trial in patients with Behcet disease shows that taking zinc gluconate 30 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve disease activity scores, quality of life, or measures of inflammation when compared with placebo ( 109453 ). more Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Although there is interest in using oral zinc for BPH, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of zinc for this condition. Beta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with beta-thalassemia major. A small clinical study in children recently diagnosed with beta-thalassemia major shows that initiating zinc sulfate in addition to standard blood transfusions increases linear growth rate when compared with transfusions alone ( 87329 ). Another small clinical study in adult and pediatric patients with thalassemia major and low bone mass shows that taking zinc 25 mg daily (as zinc sulfate) for 18 months improves whole-body bone mineral content, as well as hip and spine bone mineral density, by small amounts when compared with placebo ( 90208 ). more Brain tumor. It is unclear if dietary zinc is beneficial for reducing the risk for brain cancer. Population research has found that zinc intake is not associated with a reduced risk of developing brain cancer ( 87098 ). more Breast cancer. It is unclear if increased dietary zinc intake is beneficial for reducing the risk for breast cancer. Population research has found that neither zinc intake nor blood levels of zinc are associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer ( 106229 ). more Bronchiolitis. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for viral bronchiolitis in infants and children. A small clinical study in children 2 years or younger with acute viral bronchiolitis shows that taking elemental zinc 10-20 mg as zinc sulfate for 5 days improves clinical recovery and reduces the duration of hospital stay by almost one day when compared with placebo. After 72 hours, 98% of infants and children taking zinc were considered fully recovered, compared to only 52% of infants taking placebo ( 96076 ). more Burning mouth syndrome. Topical zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with burning mouth syndrome shows that taking zinc 15 mg and vitamin C 35 mg once daily, along with a vitamin B complex twice daily, for 30 days modestly decreases pain and burning when compared to baseline ( 105195 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Furthermore, it is unclear if the benefit is due to zinc, other vitamins, or the combination. more Burns. Intravenous zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. The effects of oral zinc for burn healing are unclear. Administering zinc intravenously in combination with other minerals seems to improve the outcomes of burn patients. Supplementation with zinc, copper, and selenium appears to improve wound healing, reduce pulmonary infections, and shorten intensive care unit stay in patients with serious burns ( 6520 , 87085 ). The effect of supplementation with zinc alone is unclear. more Canker sores. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with canker sores. Evidence for the use of zinc in canker sores is conflicting. A small clinical crossover study in patients with recurrent canker sores shows that taking zinc sulfate 660 mg daily for 3 months does not improve the size or frequency of canker sore ulcers when compared with control ( 6592 ). However, another clinical study in patients with recurrent sores and low or normal zinc levels shows that taking zinc sulfate 220 mg daily for 1 month reduces recurrence of sores when compared with placebo ( 86964 ). Reasons for conflicting results are unclear. Zinc might be beneficial when used in a muco-adhesive formulation. A small clinical study in patients with canker sores shows that taking a muco-adhesive zinc sulfate 5 mg tablet three times daily for 7 days reduces pain and speeds up healing when compared with placebo ( 104048 ). more Cataracts. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Taking zinc orally in combination with antioxidant vitamins does not seem to help treat or prevent cataracts. Taking elemental zinc 80 mg plus vitamin C 500 mg, vitamin E 400 IU, and beta-carotene 15 mg daily does not seem to have any effect on the development or progression of age-related lens opacities (cataracts) or the need for cataract surgery in well-nourished people 55-80 years of age. However, it is unknown whether earlier intervention and/or a longer period of treatment with supplements would have any effect on cataracts ( 7304 ). more Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema. It is unclear if oral zinc reduces the severity of acral erythema induced in patients treated with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) treatment regorafenib. A small study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer undergoing treatment with regorafenib shows that taking zinc gluconate 78 mg twice daily reduces the proportion of patients with more severe acral erythema when compared with control. Though there is no association in the zinc treatment group, lower serum zinc levels seem to correlate with more severe acral erythema in the control group, suggesting a possible role of zinc deficiency in the pathogenesis of acral erythema ( 112472 ). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of blinding. more Chemotherapy-related fatigue. It is unclear if oral zinc improves symptoms in patients with fatigue due to chemotherapy. A small clinical study in patients undergoing 4 or more cycles of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer shows that taking zinc 70 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve fatigue or quality of life when compared with placebo ( 97141 ). more Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in females with CFS shows that taking zinc 10 mg as zinc sulfate plus melatonin 1 mg daily for 16 weeks modestly reduces self-reported symptoms of physical fatigue when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on cognitive or psychological symptoms, sleep, or symptoms of anxiety or depression ( 106241 ). This study may not have been adequately powered to detect differences between groups. more Cirrhosis. It is unclear if zinc is beneficial for reducing cirrhosis-related mortality. A meta-analysis of four small clinical trials shows that zinc supplementation does not seem to reduce mortality in patients with cirrhosis when compared with control ( 104054 ). This finding is limited due to the heterogeneity and small size of the available studies. more Cognitive function. It is unclear if zinc is beneficial for cognitive function. A very small clinical study in adults with overweight and obesity shows that taking supplemental zinc 30 mg daily for 12 weeks improves some measures of cognitive function and executive processing but does not improve verbal fluency when compared with placebo ( 112471 ). Zinc has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical trial in healthy adults shows that taking a specific product containing a combination of zinc 9 mg, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium longum, and other ingredients (Puraflor, GSK Consumer Healthcare, Milano, Italy) orally daily for 4 weeks does not affect cognitive performance during acute stress when compared with placebo ( 110923 ). more Colorectal adenoma. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A large clinical study shows that taking a combination supplement containing zinc 30 mg, selenium 200 mcg (as l-selenomethionine), vitamin A 2 mg (as retinol), vitamin C 180 mg, and vitamin E 30 mg (as D-a-tocopherol acetate) by mouth daily for 5 years or until the recurrence of an adenoma reduces the risk of recurrent large-bowel adenomas by approximately 40% when compared with placebo ( 92903 ). It is not clear if the benefit is due to zinc, other supplements, or the combination. more Colorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for reducing colorectal cancer risk. Population research has found that increased intake of zinc is associated with a 17% to 20% reduced risk of colorectal cancer ( 90213 , 90220 ). more Congenital heart disease. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for reducing the risk of congenital heart defects. An observational study in pregnant adults has found that consuming the recommended nutritional intake of zinc may be associated with a lower risk of total congenital heart defects in infants, including atrial and ventricular septal defects, when compared with low zinc intake. This association appears to persist despite copper or selenium intake ( 108445 ). more Critical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for critically ill patients. A meta-analysis of two small randomized clinical trials in adults with head trauma shows that supplementing zinc, given as 120 mg elemental zinc orally daily or 12 mg elemental zinc intravenously daily for 15 days to 3 months, regardless of serum zinc levels, does not improve the risk of 30-day mortality when compared with control ( 111290 ). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Dementia. Although there is interest in using oral zinc for dementia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of zinc for this condition. Diabetic foot ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral zinc for diabetic foot ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of zinc for this condition. Diabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with diabetic neuropathy. A small clinical study in patients with poorly-controlled diabetic neuropathy shows that taking zinc sulfate 660 mg daily for 6 weeks improves motor nerve conduction velocity and reduces fasting and postprandial blood sugar when compared to baseline ( 86933 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of statistical comparison to the control group. more Down syndrome. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for improving immune function in people with this condition. A very small clinical study in Down syndrome patients with zinc deficiency shows that taking zinc sulfate 1 mg/kg daily for 2 months seems to improve immune function and reduce recurrent infections when compared with baseline ( 87289 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. Another small clinical study in children with Down syndrome shows that zinc 25-50 mg daily for 6 months does not improve immune function when compared with placebo ( 87278 ). Reasons for the discrepancies may be related to the dose of zinc or zinc status at baseline. more Dysmenorrhea. Oral zinc might reduce pain in some patients with primary dysmenorrhea. A meta-analysis of six low- to moderate-quality clinical studies in generally healthy patients 13-27 years of age with primary dysmenorrhea shows that taking zinc reduces patient-reported pain scores when compared with placebo. Sub-group analyses show that pain severity is reduced after 2 and 3 months but not after 1 month. These studies utilized heterogenous dosing protocols, providing elemental zinc in doses of 7-150 mg daily, either starting a few days before menstruation or on the day of menstruation and continuing for 3-13 days ( 116213 ). The validity of these results is limited by these heterogeneous dosing regimens. Furthermore, the majority of studies were conducted in Iran. One individual clinical study included in the meta-analysis shows that taking zinc sulfate 40 mg orally daily for the first 3 days of menstruation for three cycles reduces average pain scores by 51% when compared with placebo ( 111446 ). more Epilepsy. There is limited evidence on the oral use of zinc in children with intractable seizures. A small clinical study in children with intractable epilepsy shows that taking elemental zinc 1 mg/kg daily as zinc sulfate heptahydrate for 6 months reduces seizures when compared with placebo. About 31% of children taking zinc experienced a 50% decrease in seizure frequency, compared to only 5% of children taking placebo ( 96078 ). more Erectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with erectile dysfunction. A moderate-sized, open-label clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate ED shows that taking a specific combination supplement (Icarifil, Anvest Health S.p.A) containing zinc 15 mg, L-carnitine, L-citrulline, tribulus, and other ingredients daily for 3 months improves patient-reported erectile function when compared to baseline. Additionally, taking the supplement with tadalafil improves some, but not all, patient-reported assessments of erectile function when compared with taking tadalafil alone ( 114989 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to zinc, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the interpretation of these results is limited by poor methodology, including the use of per-protocol analysis and lack of a placebo group. more Esophageal cancer. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for esophageal cancer prevention. Population research in Chinese and Iranian patients has found that low intake of zinc is associated with an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell cancer ( 17205 , 87059 ). However, other population research in patients from America, Europe, or Asia has found that dietary zinc intake is not associated with esophageal cancer risk ( 90213 ). more Fatigue. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for reducing fatigue in older individuals. A clinical study in adults 50 years and older, some with below-normal levels of zinc at baseline, shows that taking zinc 30 mg daily for 70 days improves subjective fatigue when compared with no intervention ( 105675 ). The validity of this finding is limited due to a lack of placebo control and potential performance bias. Additionally, it is unclear whether baseline zinc status alters the benefits of zinc supplementation. more Gastric cancer. It is unclear if dietary zinc is beneficial for gastric cancer prevention. Population research has found that increased dietary zinc intake is not associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer ( 90213 ). more Head and neck cancer. It is unclear if oral zinc improves survival in patients with head and neck cancers. Preliminary clinical research in patients with head and neck cancers shows that zinc supplementation does not improve disease-free or metastasis-free survival rates after 3 years when compared with placebo ( 87103 ). more Hepatic encephalopathy. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for reducing the severity of hepatic encephalopathy or preventing recurrence. A meta-analysis of small clinical studies, as well as some individual clinical studies, show that short-term zinc supplementation improves cognitive function and possibly quality of life in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. These findings are based on results from the number connection test and other tests ( 87377 , 90202 , 106227 ). One study in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy used zinc bisglycinate 75 mg three times daily, providing elemental zinc 45 mg daily for 12 weeks ( 106227 ). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that short-term zinc supplementation does not improve hepatic encephalopathy severity when compared with placebo when assessed using Conn's index, which includes evaluation of mental state, asterixis (flapping tremor), number connection test, electroencephalogram (EEG) record, and plasma ammonia ( 87144 ). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that zinc sulfate supplementation does not reduce encephalopathy recurrence ( 90202 ). Based on these results, zinc supplementation may marginally improve cognitive function in hepatic encephalopathy patients, but it does not appear to improve disease severity or reduce the risk of recurrence. more HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for preventing diarrhea in adult HIV patients. Short-term zinc supplementation does not appear to TREAT diarrhea in adult HIV patients with persistent diarrhea. Clinical research shows that taking zinc 50 mg twice daily for 7 days does not reduce the duration of HIV-related diarrhea when compared with placebo ( 87055 ). However, zinc supplementation may help PREVENT HIV-related diarrhea when administered long-term. Clinical research shows that taking elemental zinc 12-15 mg daily for 18 months reduces the rate of diarrhea by about half when compared with placebo in adult HIV patients with zinc deficiency ( 87216 ). In HIV-infected children, clinical research shows that taking elemental zinc 10 mg daily for 6 months can reduce the occurrence of diarrhea by 49% when compared with placebo ( 82377 ). However, administering zinc in combination with vitamin A until 2 years of age does not reduce the occurrence of diarrhea when compared with vitamin A alone in HIV-infected children ( 82417 ). more HIV/AIDS-related opportunistic infections. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in opportunistic infections in patients with HIV/AIDs. A small clinical study in patients with AIDS shows that taking zinc supplements orally in combination with zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir) might reduce opportunistic infections of Pneumocystis carinii and Candida when compared with taking zidovudine without zinc ( 6566 ). more Human papillomavirus (HPV). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for preventing relapse in patients with vulvar warts or for treating HPV infections and cervical lesions in patients with abnormal cervical cytology. One small clinical study in patients with vulvar warts shows that taking zinc sulfate 400 mg daily for 8 weeks in addition to topical treatments including podophyllin 20%, imiquimod 5%, or cryotherapy, does not affect the duration of response, but does reduce the relapse rate by approximately 66% after 6 months, when compared with topical treatments alone ( 90190 ). Additionally, a small, open-label study in zinc-sufficient females with HPV shows that taking zinc sulfate 220 mg twice daily for 3 months reduces the odds of persistent HPV infection by 87% and improves the resolution of pre-existing cervical lesions when compared with no treatment ( 109456 ). more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral zinc reduces blood pressure in normotensive or hypertensive patients. A meta-analysis of small clinical trials shows that taking zinc reduces systolic blood pressure by about 1.5 mmHg, but does not reduce diastolic blood pressure, when compared with placebo. Response did not differ with the dosage of zinc or duration of supplementation. Only one study evaluated patients with hypertension; other patient populations included those with type 2 diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, pre-diabetes, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and patients on dialysis ( 104052 ). More research in patients with hypertension is needed to determine if zinc is beneficial in this population. more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). While some conflicting evidence exists, several small clinical studies suggest that oral zinc may improve glycemic control in patients with prediabetes. A meta-analysis of three low-quality studies in patients with prediabetes suggests that taking zinc sulfate 20-30 mg, alone or in combination with lysine and vitamin C, for 6-12 months reduces fasting blood glucose and postprandial glucose when compared with control ( 105682 ). Furthermore, a small clinical study in patients with prediabetes shows that taking zinc gluconate 30 mg daily for 90 days improves glycemic parameters when compared with placebo. All study participants were also instructed to increase physical activity and start a calorie-restricted diet ( 105391 ). However, another small clinical study in patients with prediabetes shows that taking zinc gluconate 30 mg daily for 12 months does not improve glycemic parameters when compared with placebo ( 109454 ). The available research has been conducted in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Iran, and Australia; it is unclear if these findings are generalizable to other geographic locations. more Intestinal parasite infection. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with intestinal parasitic infections. Zinc supplementation may help TREAT infection from Schistosoma mansoniin, but not other parasites, in children in developing countries. Results from one clinical study show that taking oral zinc sulfate 30-50 mg for 12 months reduces the intensity of Schistosoma mansoniin infection in children, as measured by number of eggs per gram in feces, when compared with placebo ( 87495 ). However, supplementation with zinc does not appear to reduce the intensity of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichiuris trichura, nor Giardia lamblia infection in children ( 6586 ). Furthermore, preliminary clinical research suggests that supplementation with zinc may increase the duration of Entamoeba histolytica infection in children ( 87099 ). There are also inconsistent results regarding the effects of zinc in PREVENTING intestinal parasite infections. Some clinical research shows that taking zinc in combination with vitamin A reduces the incidence of Giardia lamblia infections when compared with placebo ( 87099 ). However, zinc supplementation does not appear to prevent intestinal infections by Ascaris lumbricoides, Schistosoma haematobium, nor Schistosoma mansoniin ( 87099 , 87495 ). more Kidney failure. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for patients on hemodialysis who have resistance to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Zinc deficiency is thought to play a role in ESA-resistant anemia in patients with kidney failure. A small clinical trial in patients on hemodialysis with low zinc levels shows that taking zinc acetate hydrate, usually 25mg or 50 mg daily, for 12 months increases plasma levels of zinc and modestly reduces the required weekly dose of ESAs when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on hemoglobin levels ( 109781 ). more Leukemia. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for improving weight maintenance in children and adolescents with leukemia. A small clinical study in children and adolescents with acute leukemia shows that taking zinc 2 mg/kg (as an amino acid salt) in two divided doses daily for 60 days doubles weight gain and reduces infection rate by approximately 60% when compared with placebo. However, zinc supplementation does not appear to improve nutritional status ( 90204 ). more Liver cancer. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for preventing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In patients treated for hepatitis C, the presence of hepatic fibrosis increases the risk for development of HCC, and is also associated with low plasma zinc levels. In a retrospective analysis of patients with a sustained virological response to hepatitis C therapy, those taking oral zinc supplements for at least 6 months had approximately half the risk of developing HCC when compared with those not taking zinc. Maintaining a serum zinc level above 90 mcg/dL seems to reduce the risk for HCC ( 106904 ). more Lung cancer. It is unclear if increased dietary zinc intake is beneficial for reducing the risk of lung cancer. Population research suggests that the highest dietary intake of zinc is associated with a 32% reduced risk of lung cancer when compared with the lowest intake ( 106235 ). Additionally, another large epidemiological cancer screening trial with a mean follow-up of 12.2 years suggests that dietary intake of zinc is protective against lung cancer, with the highest quartile of dietary intake showing the greatest benefit. However, this protective effect was not found for supplemental intake of zinc ( 112096 ). more Male infertility. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for infertility in males. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking zinc sulfate 66 mg daily increases sperm count, testosterone levels, and the incidence of pregnancy in idiopathic infertile men with low testosterone levels ( 9334 , 87430 ). Another clinical study shows that taking zinc sulfate 66 mg daily can improve sperm morphology by approximately 33% when compared to baseline in men with a grade III varicocele ( 90194 ). However, not all research agrees. One clinical study shows that taking elemental zinc 30 mg with folic acid 5 mg daily for 6 months does not improve sperm morphology or pregnancy rates when compared with placebo in infertile men ( 102085 ). It is possible the lower dose used in this study was insufficient to produce the beneficial effects observed in earlier research. Zinc supplementation has also been studied as part of combination therapy. A retrospective study in males with or without varicocele-related infertility has found that taking a specific combination product containing zinc 10 mg, L-carnitine fumarate 1725 mg, acetyl-L-carnitine 500 mg, vitamin C 90 mg, coenzyme Q10 20 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, selenium 0.05 mg, and vitamin B12 0.015 mg (Proxeed Plus, Sigma-Tau) orally twice daily for 6 months improves sperm count, sperm concentration, and sperm motility when compared with baseline. Improvements in semen parameters were greatest in subjects with more severe varicoceles. The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group ( 111296 ). There is also interest in using zinc to improve results of in vitro fertilization (IVF). A small clinical study in couples undergoing IVF suggests that infertile male partners who take a specific combination product (Menevit) containing zinc and other antioxidants seem to have an increased rate of viable pregnancies when compared with placebo ( 87087 ). However, it's unclear if the benefit can be attributed to zinc, other antioxidants, or the combination. more Melasma. It is unclear if topical zinc reduces melasma severity. A small clinical study shows that applying a topical solution containing zinc sulfate 10% once daily for 2 months is less effective at reducing melasma severity when compared with hydroquinone 4% ( 90232 ). more Menopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral zinc improves sexual function after menopause. A single clinical trial shows that taking zinc sulfate 110 mg daily for 6 weeks modestly improves testosterone levels and sexual function, including desire, arousal, satisfaction, and pain, after menopause when compared with placebo ( 106228 ). more Migraine headache. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with migraine. Two small clinical studies in patients with migraine show that taking zinc sulfate 200 mg or zinc gluconate 15 mg daily for 8-12 weeks modestly reduces migraine severity and frequency when compared with placebo ( 104040 , 105684 ). Both studies were conducted in Iran; it is unclear if these findings are generalizable to other geographic locations. more Nasopharyngeal cancer. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with this type of cancer. A small clinical study in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer shows that zinc supplementation 75 mg daily for 2 months may improve disease-free survival rates after 5 years when compared with placebo ( 87163 ). more Neonatal jaundice. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for neonatal jaundice. There is contradictory evidence about the effects of oral zinc in infants with hyperbilirubinemia. Two small clinical studies in infants with idiopathic neonatal hyperbilirubinemia show that receiving oral zinc sulfate 5 mg twice daily for 5-7 days does not affect levels of total bilirubin, the required duration of phototherapy, or the duration of hospitalization, when compared with placebo ( 90212 , 104814 ). However, a larger clinical trial in preterm infants receiving phototherapy and zinc 1.2 mg/kg daily as zinc sulfate heptahydrate, via either orogastric or nasogastric tube for 10 days, serum bilirubin levels were modestly decreased only on days 8-10 when compared with phototherapy alone ( 106242 ). Additionally, a second larger clinical trial in infants with idiopathic hyperbilirubinemia shows that receiving oral zinc sulfate (Zinc sulfate, Ramofarmin Company) 1 mg/kg daily for 3 days reduces total bilirubin levels and duration of phototherapy when compared with placebo; additionally length of hospitalization is reduced by less than 1 day ( 115631 ). The reason for these discrepant findings is unclear but may be attributed to variations in baseline characteristics, treatment duration, and dose. more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with NAFLD. A small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that following a calorie-restricted diet and taking zinc 30 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces certain liver enzymes, but does not improve steatosis or reduce weight, when compared with taking placebo and following a calorie-restricted diet ( 104046 ). more Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for non-Hodgkin lymphoma prevention. Population research has found that higher dietary intake of zinc is associated with a 42% decreased odds of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( 87048 ). more Obesity. Small studies suggest that oral zinc does not reduce weight or calorie intake in people with overweight or obesity. A very small clinical study in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking supplemental zinc 30 mg daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), calorie intake, or macronutrient intake when compared with placebo ( 112471 ). Additionally, clinical research in adults with overweight or obesity shows that taking zinc gluconate 25 mg and L-selenomethionine 200 mcg once daily for 8 weeks does not improve BMI, total body fat, or fat free mass when compared with placebo ( 111448 ). more Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is unclear if oral zinc reduces symptoms in patients with OCD. A small clinical study in patients with OCD shows that taking zinc sulfate 200 mg twice daily with fluoxetine 20 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces the severity of OCD symptoms when compared with taking placebo with fluoxetine ( 90223 ). more Oral mucositis. It is unclear if oral or topical zinc prevents oral mucositis due to chemotherapy. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral zinc might prevent mucositis due to radiotherapy. Two small clinical studies in adults with leukemia and other cancers shows that taking zinc sulfate 220 mg three times daily for 14 days or until the end of chemotherapy treatment reduces oral mucositis and pain intensity when compared with placebo ( 90191 , 98132 ). However, smaller doses have not shown benefit. A small clinical study in children and adolescents with leukemia shows that taking zinc 2 mg/kg daily (up to 60 mg daily) in two divided doses does not affect chemotherapy-induced mucositis when compared with placebo ( 90204 ). An unblinded clinical study in children and adolescents aged 8-16 years with recently diagnosed leukemia shows that taking zinc gluconate 50 mg (7 mg elemental zinc) daily does not significantly reduce the incidence or duration of oral mucositis when compared with a control group not receiving zinc ( 104816 ). Zinc also doesn't seem to be beneficial with high-dose chemotherapy. A small clinical study in adolescents and adults receiving high-dose chemotherapy prior to undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) suggests that taking zinc sulfate 220 mg (50 mg elemental zinc) twice daily, beginning one day prior to the chemotherapy regimen and continuing for 3 weeks, does not affect the severity, duration, or onset of mucositis when compared with placebo ( 90215 ). Other preliminary clinical research in children aged 3-18 years receiving chemotherapy for leukemia or other cancer also shows that taking zinc 1 mg/kg orally daily for 14 days, beginning on the first day of chemotherapy, does not reduce the incidence or severity of mucositis when compared with placebo ( 111447 ). Topical zinc has also been investigated for radiation-induced or chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. In two clinical studies, using 7.5 mL of a mouthwash containing zinc chloride 0.2% twice for 2 minutes every 8 hours for 3 weeks modestly reduces the incidence and severity of oral mucositis, and improves quality of life, when compared with a placebo mouthwash ( 106232 , 109690 ). In one study, the average patient weight was higher in the group using the mouthwash containing zinc ( 106232 ). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment, consisting of at least 30 Gy radiation exposure shows that using zinc sulfate 1% mouthwash, 5 mL three times daily for 6 weeks, beginning on the first day of radiation therapy, moderately improves oral mucositis severity and pain scores when compared with chlorhexidine 0.2% or placebo mouthwash ( 111291 ). Taking zinc orally might be beneficial in radiation-induced oral mucositis. A small clinical study in patients with head and neck tumors shows that taking zinc sulfate, providing 150 mg elemental zinc, daily starting at the first day of radiation therapy and ending at 6 weeks, reduces the severity of mucositis and prolongs the onset of mucositis when compared with placebo ( 86981 ). Another clinical study in patients with head and neck cancer shows that taking zinc sulfate 150 mg daily during and after chemoradiotherapy treatment, consisting of a total 69.5 Gy radiation exposure and cisplatin 40 mg/m2 weekly, is associated with less severe mucositis when compared with placebo ( 105677 ). more Osteoporosis. It is unclear if oral zinc improves bone density in patients with osteoporosis. Population research has found that reduced zinc intake and lower zinc serum levels seem to be associated with lower bone mineral density (BMD) ( 6920 , 14410 ). In elderly patients with at least marginal zinc deficiency who are taking standard therapy for osteoporosis, preliminary clinical research shows that taking zinc acetate dihydrate (Nobelzin, Nobelpharma) providing elemental zinc 25 mg twice daily for 12 months increases BMD when compared with baseline. Increases in serum zinc were associated with improvements in BMD. However, it is unclear if increases in BMD were significant when compared with placebo ( 106230 ). It is also unclear if zinc improves BMD in patients without zinc deficiency. A small clinical study in healthy postmenopausal adults suggests that taking zinc in combination with copper, manganese, and calcium might slow bone loss when compared with placebo ( 1994 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to zinc, other ingredients, or the combination. more Overall mortality. It is unclear if oral zinc reduces overall mortality in young children. A meta-analysis of clinical research in children under the age of five years shows that supplementation with zinc in daily doses of at least 10 mg reduces the risk of all-cause mortality by 16% when compared with either placebo, other vitamin and/or mineral supplementation, or no supplementation. The risk of mortality was reduced by 54% when children took zinc for up to one year, but overall mortality was not reduced in studies lasting at least one year ( 106239 ). more Periodontitis. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with moderate or advanced periodontitis shows that taking a combination supplement containing zinc 3.75 mg, alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, cranberry extract, grapeseed extract, selenium, vitamin C, and vitamin E twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard nonsurgical therapy does not reduce periodontal indices including bleeding on probing, gingival recession, plaque index, or inflammation when compared with placebo ( 111708 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with PCOS. A small clinical study in adults taking metformin for PCOS shows that also taking zinc sulfate 220 mg (50 mg elemental zinc) daily for 8 weeks improves hair loss and facial growth, but not acne, when compared with placebo ( 96071 ). more Postoperative sore throat. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for postoperative sore throat. Clinical research shows that dissolving a lozenge containing zinc 40 mg as zinc sulfate in the mouth in the 30 minutes before surgery involving endotracheal intubation reduces the incidence of postoperative sore throat by 58% when compared with placebo lozenges. It also seems to reduce the severity of postoperative sore throat that does occur ( 97138 ). Other clinical research in adults undergoing a procedure that required endotracheal intubation shows that using a preoperative 30-mL gargle containing zinc 40 mg does not affect sore throat scores when compared with magnesium sulphate 250 mg or budesonide 200 mcg gargles ( 114763 ). more Postpartum depression. It is unclear if oral zinc prevents postpartum depression after a Cesarean section (C-section). A small observational study in pregnant patients with anemia who underwent C-section has found that taking zinc sulfate 100 mg daily for 4 days after surgery is associated with a 75% reduction in the odds of developing postpartum depression when compared with no supplementation ( 109452 ). more Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral zinc improves symptoms in patients with PMS. A small clinical study in female college students shows that taking elemental zinc 30 mg daily for 3 months improves quality of life, but not quality of sleep, when compared with placebo ( 104049 ). more Preterm labor. It is unclear if oral zinc reduces the risk of preterm labor. Observational research has found that low dietary intake of zinc during pregnancy is associated with an increased likelihood of preterm deliveries ( 87471 ). Also, most meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking zinc supplements during pregnancy modestly reduces the risk of preterm birth ( 106231 ). However, one large meta-analysis of 22 clinical studies shows that zinc supplementation during pregnancy seems to have little or no benefit for reducing the risk of preterm birth when compared with control ( 105679 ). Zinc supplementation also does not seem to reduce the risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, spontaneous abortion, or premature rupture of membranes ( 97142 , 105679 , 106231 ). more Prostatitis. It is unclear if oral zinc improves symptoms in men with chronic prostatitis. A clinical study in men with chronic prostatitis shows that taking zinc sulfate 220 mg daily along with prazosin 2 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve difficulty urinating or quality of life, but does seem to improve pain, when compared with prazosin alone ( 90210 ). The validity of this study was limited by a significant dropout rate. more Pruritus. There is limited evidence on the oral use of zinc for reducing pruritis in hemodialysis patients. A small clinical study in end-stage renal disease patients with hemodialysis-associated pruritus shows that taking zinc sulfate 220 mg twice daily for 2 months reduces pruritus severity when compared with placebo ( 90218 ). more Psoriatic arthritis. It is unclear if oral zinc improves psoriatic arthritis symptoms. Two small clinical trials in patients with psoriatic arthritis show that taking zinc orally, alone or in combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), does not seem to reduce pain or improve function when compared with control ( 6514 , 6515 ). more Respiratory tract infections. It is unclear if oral zinc reduces respiratory tract infections in children. An open-label study in children aged 6 months to 5 years with zinc deficiency shows that taking zinc sulfate 20 mg orally once daily for 2 weeks reduces the number of episodes and the mean duration of upper and lower respiratory tract infections over 6 months of follow-up when compared with the 6 months prior to zinc supplementation ( 104815 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Rosacea. It is unclear of oral zinc improves symptoms of rosacea or quality of life. A small clinical trial shows that taking zinc sulfate 440 mg in two divided doses daily for 90 days does not improve quality of life or symptoms associated with rosacea when compared with placebo ( 90195 ). more Seizures. It is unclear if oral zinc reduces recurrent febrile seizures in children. Although some individual preliminary clinical research disagrees ( 96069 ), a meta-analysis of generally low-quality research in children under 5 years of age with a previous febrile seizure shows that taking zinc sulfate 1-2 mg/kg or 20 mg daily for 6-12 months does not reduce febrile seizure recurrence when compared with placebo ( 106237 ). Also, a small clinical study shows that taking zinc does not increase the time to first febrile seizure recurrence ( 96069 ). more Sepsis. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in pediatric or adult patients with sepsis. A meta-analysis of clinical research in children under the age of five years shows that supplementation with zinc reduces the risk of sepsis mortality by 57% when compared with either placebo, other vitamin and/or mineral supplementation, or no supplementation ( 106239 ). Also, a small clinical study in newborns with sepsis shows that giving zinc sulfate monohydrate 3 mg/kg twice daily for 10 days along with antibiotics reduces the likelihood of neurological abnormalities, such as those related to posture, behavior, and reflexes, by 70% when compared with antibiotics alone. Mortality and length of hospital stay were not improved, but the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in these parameters ( 96077 ). Another study in preterm infants with late-onset sepsis (developing at least 72 hours after birth), shows that giving 1.4 mg/kg elemental zinc daily orally for 10 days in addition to antibiotics reduces the number of infants with unresolved sepsis at 10 days, and reduces C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels, when compared with giving antibiotics alone ( 104819 ). A meta-analysis of small clinical studies in infants less than 4 months old shows that administering zinc 1-3 mg/kg daily for 1-18 weeks may reduce the rate of infant mortality and treatment failure when compared with placebo or control, but does not seem to prevent sepsis or improve sepsis-related mortality ( 108444 ). Additionally, zinc has been evaluated in adults. A single-center observational study in adults with sepsis found that administering zinc orally or enterally in various doses, ranging from less than 15 mg to greater than 50 mg daily, does not improve survival rates or reduce the length of stay in the intensive care unit ( 115630 ). more Shigellosis. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with acute shigellosis from food poisoning. A small clinical study in malnourished children with acute shigellosis (food poisoning) shows that administering a multivitamin syrup containing elemental zinc 20 mg daily for 2 weeks, in addition to standard treatment, can improve recovery time and reduce the number of diarrhea episodes when compared with multivitamin syrup without elemental zinc ( 87088 ). more Sleep deprivation. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A very small clinical study in sleep-deprived recreational athletes shows that taking a combination of zinc 90 mg, magnesium 1350 mg, and vitamin B6 31.5 mg orally for 3 nights at bedtime does not change sleep quality, subjective sleepiness, mood, or fatigue when compared with placebo ( 113655 ). more Substance use disorder. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for substance use disorder. Preliminary clinical research in adults with opioid use disorder that were being treated with methadone shows that taking zinc sulfate, containing 12 mg zinc, orally daily for 3 months moderately improves relapse prevention scores, including drug use and drug craving scores, when compared with control. Taking zinc also modestly improved stress and anxiety scores ( 111293 ). more Tonsillopharyngitis. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in patients with tonsillopharyngitis. A moderate-sized, open-label clinical study in pediatric patients aged 3 to 10 years with acute tonsillopharyngitis shows that taking a specific combination solution (PediaFlù, Pediatrica S.r.l.) containing zinc (age dependent doses ranging from 2 to 4 mg), honey, propolis, and pelargonium sidoides daily for 6 days along with standard of care reduces tonsilitis severity scores when compared with standard care alone; however, this improvement is not clinically significant. ( 115632 ). It is not clear if these effects are due to zinc, other ingredients, or the combination. more Traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is limited evidence on the parenteral use of zinc for closed head injury. A small clinical study shows that administering zinc parenterally immediately following severe closed head injury seems to improve the rate of neurological recovery when compared with standard therapy ( 2696 ). more Tuberculosis. It is unclear if oral zinc can improve outcomes in patients receiving tuberculosis treatment. Low levels of zinc are common in patients with tuberculosis. In patients newly diagnosed with tuberculosis and using anti-tuberculosis treatment, some clinical research shows that taking zinc 50 mg daily as zinc sulfate for 6 months increases the number of patients with negative sputum smears by 50% to 80% within the first 6 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo. However, there were no differences in the number of patients with negative smears after this time point. There were also improvements in some liver function enzyme levels after 2 months, but not 6 months, when compared with placebo ( 106238 ). However, other clinical research shows that taking zinc 15-90 mg daily for 2-6 months does not improve cure rates or sputum smear conversions when compared with placebo. However, when combined with vitamin A, serum levels of vitamin A, zinc, and hemoglobin were modestly improved and there was a modest increase in sputum smear conversions ( 109754 ). more Urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial in children with UTI. A low-quality, clinical study in children aged 3-12 years hospitalized for a UTI and receiving intravenous antibiotic treatment shows that taking zinc 1 mg/kg daily for 14 days reduces the duration of dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency when compared with intravenous antibiotics alone. Zinc does not improve fever or the time to negative urine culture ( 96081 ). However, this study did not demonstrate that treatment groups were equal at baseline. more Venous leg ulcers. It is unclear if oral or topical zinc is beneficial for leg ulcer healing. Two small studies in elderly patients with leg ulcers suggest that using a zinc saline solution on a wound dressing or applying zinc oxide to a dressing might improve healing of leg ulcers ( 2694 , 6901 ). However, oral zinc supplementation does not seem to be beneficial. A meta-analysis of four small clinical trials in patients with venous leg ulcers shows that taking zinc orally does not improve healing when compared with placebo ( 104079 ). more Vertigo. Oral zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in adults with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 20 ng/mL shows that taking a specific combination product containing zinc 7.5 mg, alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg, L-carnosine 165 mg, curcumin 100 mg, piperine 1 mg, cholecalciferol 800 units, vitamin B2 0.8 mg, and vitamin B6 1 mg (Vertistop D, Difass) orally daily for 6 months moderately reduces the number of vertigo relapse episodes when compared with control. However, in patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels greater than 20 ng/mL that took a specific combination product containing zinc 7.5 mg, alanine 600 mg, L-carnosine 165 mg, curcumin 100 mg and piperine 1 mg (Vertistop L, Difass) orally daily for 6 months there was no difference in relapse episodes when compared with control ( 111294 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to zinc, other ingredients, or the combination. more Water warts. It is unclear if oral zinc is beneficial for the treatment of water warts in children. In children with water warts, preliminary clinical research shows that taking zinc sulfate heptahydrate (as Zinco syrup) for 2 months results in lesion resolution in 70% of patients when compared with baseline. Lesion resolution occurred in an additional 13% of patients in the month after treatment completion, with no recurrence in any of these children over the next 9 months. Zinc 3 mg daily was used in children up to 3 years of age, and 5 mg daily was used in older children ( 106234 ). Due to the lack of a comparator group, it is unclear if these outcomes are due to zinc or the natural resolution of the condition. more Wound healing. Topical zinc might be beneficial for the healing of uncomplicated wounds. A small clinical study shows that applying zinc chloride solution, standardized to contain zinc 20 mcg/mL, twice daily improves wound healing when compared with saline solution in patients with uncomplicated, skin wounds. However, when zinc is administered as a component of an insulin product (Humulin, Eli Lilly and Company), it seems to be more effective than zinc chloride alone ( 90192 ). more Wrinkled skin. Topical zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A topical preparation containing 10% vitamin C as L-ascorbic acid and acetyl tyrosine, zinc sulfate, sodium hyaluronate, and bioflavonoids (Cellex-C High Potency Serum) applied to photo-aged facial skin for 3 months seems to improve fine and coarse wrinkling, yellowing and sallowness, roughness, and skin tone when compared with placebo ( 6155 ). more Fecal incontinence . Topical zinc has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in females with fecal incontinence shows that topically applying an ointment containing zinc sulfate 1% and aluminum sulfate 5% to the anal canal mucosa three times daily for 4 weeks improves symptoms approximately twice as much as a placebo ointment. Quality of life related to the incontinence also improved ( 90219 ). more More evidence is needed to rate zinc for these uses.</data><data key="safety_text">Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Zinc is safe in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 40 mg daily ( 7135 ). ...when used topically and appropriately ( 2688 , 6538 , 6539 , 7135 , 8623 , 11051 , 111291 ). Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately in doses higher than the tolerable upper intake level (UL). Because the UL of zinc is based on regular daily intake, short-term excursions above 40 mg daily are not likely to be harmful. In fact, there is some evidence that doses of elemental zinc as high as 80 mg daily in combination with copper 2 mg can be used safely for approximately 6 years without significant adverse effects ( 7303 , 8622 , 92212 ). However, there is some concern that doses higher than the UL of 40 mg daily might decrease copper absorption and result in anemia ( 7135 ). Possibly Unsafe when used intranasally. Case reports and animal research suggest that intranasal zinc might cause permanent anosmia or loss of sense of smell ( 11155 , 11156 , 11703 , 11704 , 11705 , 11706 , 11707 , 16800 , 16801 , 17083 ). Several hundred reports of anosmia have been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer of some intranasal zinc products (Zicam) ( 16800 , 16801 ). Advise patients not to use intranasal zinc products. Likely Unsafe when taken orally in excessive amounts. Ingestion of 10-30 grams of zinc sulfate can be lethal in adults ( 7135 ). Chronic intake of 450-1600 mg daily can cause multiple forms of anemia, copper deficiency, and myeloneuropathies ( 7135 , 17092 , 17093 , 112473 ). This has been reported with use of zinc-containing denture adhesives in amounts exceeding the labeled directions, such as several times a day for several years ( 17092 , 17093 ). Advise patients to follow the label directions on denture adhesives that contain zinc. CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately ( 7135 ). Zinc is safe in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL for children is based on age: 4 mg daily for 0-6 months, 5 mg daily for 7-12 months, 7 mg daily for 1-3 years, 12 mg daily for 4-8 years, 23 mg daily for 9-13 years, and 34 mg daily for 14-18 years ( 7135 , 97140 ). CHILDREN: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in high doses. Taking amounts greater than the UL can cause sideroblastic anemia and copper deficiency ( 7135 ). ...when used topically on damaged skin. An infant treated with 10% zinc oxide ointment for severe diaper rash with perianal erosions developed hyperzincemia. Absorption seemed to occur mainly via the erosions; plasma levels dropped after the erosions healed despite continued use of the ointment ( 106905 ). PREGNANCY: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Zinc is safe in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 34 mg daily during pregnancy in those 14-18 years of age and 40 mg daily in those 19-50 years of age ( 7135 ). PREGNANCY: Likely Unsafe when used orally in doses exceeding the UL ( 7135 ). LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Zinc is safe in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 34 mg daily during lactation in those 14-18 years of age, and 40 mg daily for those 19-50 years of age ( 7135 ). LACTATION: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in doses exceeding the UL. Higher doses can cause zinc-induced copper deficiency in nursing infants ( 7135 ).</data></node>

Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, taking zinc along with integrase inhibitors might decrease the levels and clinical effects of these drugs. Zinc is a divalent cation. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that other divalent cations such as calcium and iron can decrease blood levels of the integrase inhibitor dolutegravir through chelation ( 93578 , 93579 ). more PENICILLAMINE (Cuprimine, Depen)</data><data key="severity">High</data><data key="interaction_type">See description</data></edge>

Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Zinc can decrease the levels and clinical effects of quinolones antibiotics. Quinolones form complexes with zinc in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing absorption of both the quinolone and zinc if taken at the same time ( 828 , 2682 , 3046 , 11600 ). Advise patients to take these drugs at least 2 hours before, or 4-6 hours after, zinc supplements. more RITONAVIR (Norvir)</data></edge>

Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Zinc might reduce levels of tetracycline antibiotics. Tetracyclines form complexes with zinc in the gastrointestinal tract, which can reduce absorption of both the tetracycline and zinc when taken at the same time ( 3046 , 4945 ). Taking zinc sulfate 200 mg with tetracycline reduces absorption of the antibiotic by 30% to 40% ( 11615 ). Demeclocycline and minocycline cause a similar interaction ( 4945 ). However, doxycycline does not seem to interact significantly</data></edge>
