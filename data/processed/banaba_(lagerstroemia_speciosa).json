  "effectiveness_text": "Expand All | Collapse All Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Diabetes. It is unclear if oral banaba is beneficial in patients with type 2 diabetes. One preliminary clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that a specific banaba extract (Glucosol), standardized to corosolic acid 1%, taken as 32 or 48 mg daily for 2 weeks is associated with 10% lower blood glucose levels when compared with placebo ( 11954 ). Another preliminary clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by oral antidiabetic agents shows that taking a specific combination product containing extracts of banaba leaf and Padang cassia (Inlacin, Dexa Medica) 100 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.65% when compared with baseline ( 92849 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if this effect is due to banaba, Padang cassia, or the combination. more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Oral banaba has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking a specific combination product containing extracts of banaba leaf and Padang cassia (Inlacin, Dexa Medica) daily for 12 weeks preserves beta-cell function and insulin release and improves insulin sensitivity, but not 2-hour postprandial glucose levels, when compared with placebo. All patients received 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks, and those considered to be non-responders were titrated up to 100 mg once daily for the remaining 8 weeks ( 92848 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to banaba, Padang cassia, or the combination. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral banaba is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome. A small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that a specific banaba extract (MonoHerb), standardized to corosolic acid 1.13%, taken as 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol when compared with baseline ( 108617 ). The lack of statistical comparison to the placebo group limits the validity of these findings. more More evidence is needed to rate banaba for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Possibly Safe when banaba extract is used orally and appropriately, short-term ( 11954 , 92848 , 92849 ). A specific banaba extract (Glucosol) has been safely used at doses of 32-48 mg daily for 2 weeks ( 11954 ). Another specific product containing extracts of banaba leaf and Padang cassia (Inlacin, Dexa Medica) has been safely used at doses up to 100 mg daily for 12 weeks ( 92848 , 92849 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of banaba extract when used long-term. PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",

  "mechanism_text": "General The applicable part of the banaba tree is the leaf. Active constituents include corosolic acid and the ellagitannins lagerstroemin, flosin B, and reginin A ( 11954 , 11955 , 11956 ). Anticancer effects Laboratory research suggests that low concentrations of extracts from banaba inhibit DNA-protein interactions. The banaba extract inhibited nuclear factors and targeted DNA elements mimicking sequences recognized by the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) ( 33556 ). Banaba extracts inhibited cell proliferation in human tumor cell lines, including human erythromyeloid K562 ( 31024 ). Antidiabetes effect In diabetic animals and in humans with type 2 diabetes, banaba extract lowers blood glucose ( 11954 , 11955 ). In vitro research suggests that the ellagitannins have an insulin-like effect ( 11956 ). Research on lagerstroemin suggests that it might activate insulin receptors ( 11957 ). Antihypertensive effects In a model of hypertensive rats, banaba appears to modulate increased blood pressure when compared with untreated hypertensive rats. Additionally, researchers conclude that banaba may increase levels of nitric oxide (NO), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and may reduce levels of reactive oxygen species, oxidative stress enzymes, and inflammatory cytokines when compared with untreated hypertensive rats ( 110703 ). Weight loss effect In genetically diabetic obese mice, banaba seems to suppress weight gain ( 11959 ). In contrast, a study of hypertensive rats suggests that banaba prevents weight loss when compared with untreated hypertensive rats ( 110703 ). Xanthine oxidase inhibitory effect The banaba constituent valoneic acid seems to have xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity similar to or better than allopurinol, according to in vitro research ( 11958 ).",
