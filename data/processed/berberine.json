  "overview_text": "Berberine is a bitter-tasting, yellow-colored alkaloid that is found in the roots, rhizomes, and stem bark of various plants, including European barberry, goldenseal, goldthread, greater celandine, Oregon grape, phellodendron, and tree turmeric. It was first isolated in the early 20th century from plants used in traditional Chinese medicine",
  "effectiveness_text": "Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Canker sores. Some evidence shows that berberine gel applied to canker sores may reduce pain and the size of the sores, but it has not been compared to conventional treatments. Some clinical research shows that applying a gel containing berberine 5 mg/gram four times daily for 5 days can reduce pain by 26% and ulcer size by 30% when compared with placebo in patients with minor recurrent canker sores. Erythema and exudation also appear to be improved ( 91955 ). more Diabetes. Berberine seems to moderately reduce blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes; it may provide additional benefit when given with conventional medications. Some clinical research shows that taking berberine 500 mg 2-3 times daily for 2-4 months can reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial glucose (PPG) in subjects with type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo, and may be similarly effective to metformin 500 mg 2-3 times daily or rosiglitazone 4 mg daily ( 20579 , 34247 , 34265 , 110099 ). Large meta-analyses show that taking berberine, 0.9-3 grams in 2-3 divided doses daily for 1-11 months, in combination with lifestyle interventions, can reduce FPG by 10-16 mg/dL, PPG by 27-34 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 0.4% to 0.7% when compared with lifestyle interventions alone. Also, taking berberine in combination with oral hypoglycemic drugs appears to lower FPG by 12-19 mg/dL, PPG by 18-24 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 0.6% to 0.9% when compared with hypoglycemic drugs alone ( 91956 , 110097 ). Berberine has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking berberine 500 mg with Bifidobacterium adolescentis 100 million colony-forming units (CFU) twice daily for 16 weeks reduces FPG by 10 mg/dL, PPG by 28 mg/dL, and HbA1c by 0.22% when compared with placebo ( 110099 ). Another clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking berberine 600 mg twice daily with a multi-strain probiotic supplement, containing more than 50 billion CFU, once daily for 12 weeks reduces postprandial cholesterol by 15 mg/dL and postprandial low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 9 mg/dL when compared with placebo. Postprandial triglyceride levels were also improved, while postprandial levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were not affected ( 110100 ). more Helicobacter pylori. Oral berberine, when taken with amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) with or without clarithromycin, might be as effective as bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (BQT), vonoprazan quadruple therapy, and PPI-based triple therapy for eradication of Helicobacter pylori. Most studies evaluate berberine in combination with an antibiotic and acid blocker for the treatment of H. pylori infection. Open-label clinical studies in patients with treatment-naïve H. pylori infection shows that taking berberine 300-500 mg with amoxicillin 1 gram and an acid reducer such as esomeprazole 20 mg, rabeprazole 10 mg, or vonoprazan 20 mg, with or without clarithromycin 500 mg, 2-3 times daily for 14 days is non-inferior to BQT, vonoprazan quadruple therapy (vonoprazan, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, bismuth), and rabeprazole quadruple therapy (rabeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, bismuth) for H. pylori eradication and clinical symptom improvement. Eradication rates were around 70% to 91% and 69% to 90% in the berberine- and bismuth-containing groups, respectively. BQT is a guideline-recommended treatment regimen for H. pylori eradication ( 97234 , 111697 ). Also, berberine triple therapy appears to be better tolerated when compared with BQT. Quadruple therapy consisted of amoxicillin, rabeprazole, clarithromycin, and bismuth tartrate ( 110107 ). A smaller clinical study in patients with H. pylori-associated duodenal ulcers shows that taking berberine 300 mg three times daily for 6 weeks is more effective for eradicating H. pylori than taking ranitidine 150 mg twice daily, but is less effective for promoting ulcer healing ( 34319 ). more Hyperlipidemia. Clinical research shows that taking berberine orally, alone or in combination with other ingredients, reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides in people with hyperlipidemia. Meta-analyses of clinical research in people with hyperlipidemia or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) show that berberine reduces total cholesterol by 13-32 mg/dL, triglycerides by up to 34 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol by 10-26 mg/dL, and apolipoprotein B by 0.25 g/L when compared with control or lifestyle interventions. However, the meta-analyses conflict on the effect of berberine on HDL cholesterol, with the studies in patients with hyperlipidemia showing that it reduces HDL cholesterol by 2-3 mg/dL while the analysis in patients with NAFLD shows that berberine has no effect on HDL cholesterol when compared with control or lifestyle interventions. ( 20579 , 34228 , 111363 , 111700 , 113462 ). Meta-analyses also show that berberine alone is similarly effective to statins at lowering lipid levels ( 100983 , 111362 ). Administration of berberine in combination with lipid-lowering drugs such as statins lowers total cholesterol by 10-15 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol by up to 9 mg/dL, and triglycerides by up to 30 mg/dL when compared with lipid-lowering drugs alone ( 91953 , 91956 , 99921 , 100983 , 111362 ). The dosage of berberine used most often in these studies was 500 mg twice daily, or 200-500 mg three times daily for 3-24 months. However, one meta-analysis suggests that berberine's effects on lipid levels may be transient, with significant improvements in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol lacking in studies lasting 3 or more months ( 111362 ). Berberine has also been studied in combination with other supplements. Taking a combination product containing berberine 500 mg, policosanol 10 mg, and red yeast rice 200 mg daily for up to 12 months reduces total and LDL cholesterol levels when compared with placebo or ezetimibe 10 mg ( 34262 , 34283 , 34301 ). Taking another combination product (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm S.p.A.) containing berberine, red yeast rice, policosanol, folic acid, coenzyme Q10, and astaxanthin daily for up to 12 months reduces total cholesterol by 10% to 13% and LDL cholesterol by 14% to 21%, and increases HDL cholesterol by 4% to 5% when compared with baseline or placebo. These effects are comparable to those seen with pravastatin 10 mg daily ( 89438 , 92142 ). It is unclear if the benefits of this combination product are due to berberine, other ingredients, or the combination. It is possible that the majority of the therapeutic effect is due to an ingredient in red yeast rice (monacolin K) that is identical to lovastatin. more Hypertension. Berberine may have added benefits for reducing blood pressure when used in combination with amlodipine. A meta-analysis shows that taking berberine 0.9 grams daily in combination with amlodipine for 2 months reduces systolic blood pressure by 5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg when compared with amlodipine alone ( 91956 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Berberine may improve some metabolic characteristics in women with PCOS and insulin resistance. It may also increase live births, although the data are conflicting. Clinical research in patients with PCOS and insulin resistance shows that taking berberine 500-550 mg 2-3 times daily for 3 to 6 months reduces fasting plasma glucose, markers of insulin resistance, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, testosterone levels, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, acne severity, and markers of inflammation when compared with placebo or baseline. Berberine also seems to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels ( 34282 , 91952 , 111364 ). Lipid parameters also improved when compared with metformin, as did waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index, and SHBG levels in some, but not all, studies ( 34282 , 91952 ). The effect of berberine on ovulation, pregnancy, and birth rates in women with PCOS is unclear. A meta-analysis of several small, lower quality clinical studies conducted in China in patients with PCOS shows that taking berberine 900 mg daily in combination with other treatments, such as clomiphene or letrozole, for 3 to 6 months improves ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates when compared to medication therapy alone ( 115725 ). The validity of these findings is limited by heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including treatment combinations and duration. Additionally, the effect on birth rates was not evaluated. A clinical study, not included in the analysis above, shows that taking berberine 500 mg three times daily for three months prior to controlled ovarian stimulation increases the number of clinical pregnancies and live births by almost two-fold when compared with placebo. These effects are comparable to taking metformin 500 mg three times daily for 3 months ( 91952 ). However, other clinical research shows that taking a combination of berberine 1.5 grams daily and letrozole for ovarian stimulation does not increase live birth rates when compared with letrozole alone ( 97235 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in patients with antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. A small clinical study in patients with schizophrenia who developed metabolic syndrome associated with antipsychotic therapy shows that taking berberine 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces body weight by 1.1 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 0.4 kg/m2, total cholesterol by 22 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 20 mg/dL, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.09% when compared with placebo ( 110103 ). more Atrial fibrillation. Limited research suggests that oral berberine might prevent atrial fibrillation shortly after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. A small clinical study in Chinese patients who underwent CABG surgery shows that taking berberine 400 mg three times daily for 7 days reduces the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation by 50% when compared with placebo ( 110106 ). more Biliary disorders. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in patients with biliary disorders. A small clinical study in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis shows that taking berberine ursodeoxycholate, an ionic salt formulation of berberine and ursodeoxycholic acid, 500-1000 mg twice daily for 6 weeks reduces levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a marker of cholestasis and bile duct injury, when compared with placebo. ALP levels decreased by at least 50% in 7% and 17% of patients taking 500 mg and 1000 mg, respectively, compared with 0% of patients taking placebo ( 110105 ). more Burns. Topical berberine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that topical treatment of second degree burns with an ointment containing berberine, beta-sitosterol, sesame oil, and other ingredients, applied every 4 hours for 20 days, is similar to conventional treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream ( 13526 ). It is unclear if this benefit is due to berberine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if berberine is beneficial in patients with CVD. A meta-analysis of several small clinical studies in patients with atherosclerosis, ischemic stroke, or coronary heart disease shows that taking berberine alone does not improve lipid levels or markers of atherosclerosis but does reduce markers of inflammation when compared with routine therapy or statins. Additionally, the pooled analysis suggests that berberine reduces stroke severity, as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale, in patients with ischemic stroke ( 111362 ). This meta-analysis also shows that, when taken with a statin, berberine improves lipid levels, stroke severity, markers of atherosclerosis, and inflammatory markers when compared with statin therapy alone or routine treatment ( 111362 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the overall low-quality of the included studies, with unclear blinding and randomization; significant heterogeneity and differences in patient populations, berberine doses, and treatment durations studied; and concerns related to publication bias. more Cholera. Although taking a single dose of berberine may be modestly beneficial for reducing stool volume, using berberine daily with tetracycline does not seem to provide added benefit. Some preliminary clinical research shows that a single dose of berberine sulfate 400 mg decreases 24-hour stool volume by a small amount in subjects with cholera when compared with placebo ( 262 ). However, taking berberine 200-400 mg daily along with tetracycline 500 mg four times daily does not seem to further enhance the effects of tetracycline in treating cholera-induced diarrhea ( 34305 , 34306 ). more Colorectal adenoma. Berberine may help prevent adenoma recurrence after polypectomy. Preliminary clinical research in Chinese patients with colorectal adenomas who had undergone complete polypectomy shows that taking berberine 0.3 grams twice daily for 2 years reduces the risk of adenoma recurrence by 22% when compared with placebo ( 103197 ). A meta-analysis of this trial and two other small clinical studies in Chinese patients with a history of colorectal adenomas shows that taking berberine 0.1 grams three times daily for 18 months or 0.3 grams twice daily for 2 years reduces the risk of adenoma recurrence by 31% and 25% at years 1 and 2, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 110101 ). All available research has been conducted in China; it is unclear whether these results can be applied to other geographic locations. more Congestive heart failure (CHF). Berberine may provide additional benefit to patients with CHF who are taking conventional medications. Preliminary clinical research in patients with CHF secondary to ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy shows that adding berberine 1.2-2 grams daily for 8 weeks to conventional medications can reduce the frequency and complexity of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and reduce mortality when compared with placebo ( 13520 ). more Coronary heart disease (CHD). Oral berberine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in statin-intolerant patients with coronary heart disease treated with a percutaneous intervention (PCI) shows that taking a specific combination product (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm S.p.A.) containing berberine 500 mg, red yeast rice 200 mg, policosanol 10 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, coenzyme Q10 2 mg, and astaxanthin 0.5 mg daily for 3 months reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol to a greater extent than ezetimibe 10 mg daily. Combining this specific product with either ezetimibe or a low-dose statin produces additional improvements in all lipid parameters after 3-12 months of treatment when compared with any of the agents alone ( 97232 , 97233 ). It is unclear if the benefits of this combination product are due to berberine, other ingredients, or the combination. Because red yeast rice contains a compound identical to lovastatin (monacolin K), it is likely that the cholesterol-lowering potential of this combination is mainly attributable to the red yeast rice constituent. more Diarrhea. Limited data suggest that berberine may be helpful for diarrhea caused by bacteria. Some preliminary clinical research shows that a single dose of berberine sulfate 400 mg decreases 24-hour stool volume in subjects with Escherichia coli-induced diarrhea when compared with placebo ( 262 ). more Glaucoma. It is unclear if berberine is beneficial for glaucoma when used as an eye drop. Preliminary clinical research shows that using eye drops containing berberine 2.5 mg and tetrahydrozoline 2.5 mg for 3 days does not reduce intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma when compared with eye drops containing tetrahydrozoline alone ( 34304 ). more Hepatitis B. It is unclear if berberine is beneficial for improving liver function in people with hepatitis B. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 1 gram daily for 2 months decreases blood glucose, triglycerides, and markers of liver damage, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), in subjects with type 2 diabetes and hepatitis B when compared with control ( 34265 ). more Hepatitis C. It is unclear if berberine is beneficial for improving liver function in people with this form of hepatitis. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 1 gram daily for 2 months decreases blood glucose, triglycerides, and markers of liver damage, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), in subjects with type 2 diabetes and hepatitis C when compared with control ( 34265 ). more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Small studies suggest that oral berberine may be beneficial in adults with prediabetes. A very small clinical study in adults with overweight and prediabetes shows that taking berberine aqueous root extract (HIMABERB, Pharma Base S.A.) 500 mg 3 times daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by 15 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.7%, and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test by 28 mg/dL and improves fasting insulin levels and measures of insulin resistance when compared with placebo ( 111699 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a very small sample size. Another small clinical study in adults with prediabetes shows that taking berberine phospholipids (Berbevis, Indena, SpA, Italy) 550 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by 4 mg/dL and improves insulin levels when compared with placebo ( 111700 ). more Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). One small clinical study suggests that oral berberine may be beneficial in people with diarrhea-predominant IBS. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 400 mg twice daily for 8 weeks in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS reduces the frequency of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and defecation urgency when compared with placebo. Berberine may also improve overall symptom scores and IBS quality of life ( 97236 ). Observational research suggests that adding a supplement (Enterofytol PLUS, Tilman SA) providing berberine 200 mg and curcumin 42 mg orally twice daily for 2 months to conventional IBS treatment is associated with improvements in symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, distension, and stool status, by up to 48% when compared with conventional treatment alone. Use of the supplement was also associated with a 64% reduced need for conventional treatments ( 113354 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to berberine, curcumin, or the combination. more Menopausal symptoms. Oral berberine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of berberine plus soy isoflavones can reduce vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women when compared with taking calcium plus vitamin D ( 34287 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to berberine, soy isoflavones, or the combination. more Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in patients with MASLD. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with MASLD shows that taking berberine extract 500 mg orally three times daily for 12 weeks does not improve markers of liver damage or insulin resistance, fatty liver indices, or most lipid levels when compared with placebo ( 114769 ). Also review effectiveness in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a similar condition. more Metabolic syndrome. Berberine may reduce some of the signs and symptoms of metabolic syndrome, but the evidence is weak. Preliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking berberine hydrochloride 500 mg three times daily before meals for 3 months reduces body mass index (BMI) by 0.6 kg/m2, systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 8 mmHg, triglycerides by 18 mg/dL, and serum glucose levels by 2 mg/dL, and can also improve insulin sensitivity, when compared with baseline ( 91957 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group. Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination product (Armolipid Plus, Rottapharm S.p.A.) containing berberine 500 mg, red yeast rice 200 mg, policosanol 10 mg, folic acid 0.2 mg, coenzyme Q10 2 mg, and astaxanthin 0.5 mg daily for 18 weeks improves SBP, left ventricular mass, and flow-mediated dilation in patients with metabolic syndrome when compared with control ( 34289 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to berberine, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral berberine may improve some measures of liver function and blood lipids in people with NAFLD. A meta-analysis of clinical studies and preliminary clinical research in patients with NAFLD, some with comorbid type 2 diabetes, show that taking berberine 600 mg to 6.35 grams daily, alone or in combination with metformin or lifestyle interventions, for 7 to 22 weeks reduces markers of liver damage, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and improves body mass index (BMI), measures of insulin resistance, and most lipid parameters when compared with control and baseline ( 34286 , 113462 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 500 mg three times daily for 16 weeks reduces hepatic fat content by 21% when compared with lifestyle modification. Berberine also seems to reduce hepatic fat content, AST, and ALT similarly to pioglitazone 15 mg daily, while reducing body weight, body mass index, and total cholesterol more than pioglitazone ( 97237 ). Also review effectiveness in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a similar condition. more Obesity. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in patients with obesity. A meta-analysis of 12 small clinical studies, most in patients with various metabolic conditions, shows that taking berberine 300-1500 mg daily for up to 24 months reduces body weight by around 2 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 0.5 kg/m2, and waist circumference by about 1 cm when compared with a control group ( 104508 ). However, most of the studies are small, of varying quality, with significant heterogeneity, and likely inadequately powered to detect significant changes. Additionally, none of the studies required patients to have overweight or obesity for inclusion. more Radiation fibrosis. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial for reducing radiation-induced lung damage. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 20 mg/kg once daily for 6 weeks during radiation therapy reduces the incidence of radiation-induced lung injury and improves lung function in patients treated for NSCLC when compared with placebo ( 34253 ). more Radiation-induced diarrhea. One small study suggests that oral berberine may reduce diarrhea associated with radiation-induced intestinal damage. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine 300 mg three times daily for 2 weeks can reduce the frequency and severity of radiation-induced intestinal damage and diarrhea in patients receiving abdominal or pelvic radiation therapy when compared with placebo ( 34263 ). more Stroke. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial in adults with acute ischemic stroke. A meta-analysis of several small clinical studies in adults with acute ischemic stroke shows that taking berberine 0.3-1.0 grams daily for up to 6 months in addition to conventional therapy reduces stroke severity, as measured by the NIH Stroke Scale, improves markers of atherosclerosis and inflammation, and reduces triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared with routine therapy as control ( 111698 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the overall low quality of the included studies, with unclear blinding and randomization. Other limitations include significant heterogeneity in patient populations, berberine doses, and treatment durations studied. more Thrombocytopenia. It is unclear if oral berberine is beneficial for improving platelet counts in people with this condition. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking berberine bisulfate 5 mg three times daily before meals for 15 days, either alone or with prednisolone, can increase platelet count in patients with primary or secondary thrombocytopenia when compared with baseline ( 34317 ). more Trachoma. It is unclear if berberine is beneficial for trachoma when administered as eye drops. Preliminary clinical research shows that berberine ophthalmic solution might be useful for treating trachoma, a common cause of blindness in developing countries. Solutions of 0.2% berberine have been applied three times daily for 3-12 weeks, or solutions of 0.5% three times daily for 1-3 weeks ( 13523 , 34303 , 34310 , 34313 ). more Ulcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral or rectal berberine is beneficial for ulcerative colitis. A meta-analysis of several small, lower quality clinical studies in adults with ulcerative colitis shows that taking berberine orally (600-900 mg daily) or rectally (4-6 grams daily) for 3-12 weeks, in addition to mesalamine, improves the rate of patients with complete remission or reduced symptoms, such as bowel movements, blood in stools, or abdominal pain, when compared to mesalamine alone ( 115724 ). The validity of these findings is limited by heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including route of administration and treatment duration. more Ventricular arrhythmias. Limited research suggests that oral berberine might lower the frequency of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Data from a meta-analysis of 10 small clinical trials, all conducted in China, shows that taking oral berberine, 0.3-0.6 grams 3 or 4 times daily for 7-30 days has a similar efficacy rate to antiarrhythmic drugs, and a lower incidence of adverse effects, in the management of PVCs. A combination of berberine and antiarrhythmic drugs has a higher efficacy rate and similar adverse effect rate, when compared with antiarrhythmic drugs alone ( 112947 ). The quality of this evidence is low. more More evidence is needed to rate berberine for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately. Berberine has been used safely in doses up to 1.5 grams daily for 6 months ( 262 , 13520 , 20579 ) ( 34317 , 34228 , 34247 , 34253 , 34262 , 34263 , 34265 , 34267 , 34277 , 34282 ), ( 34283 , 34286 , 34287 , 34289 , 34293 , 34301 , 34305 , 34306 , 34319 , 34325 )( 99920 , 99921 , 103194 ) or up to 1 gram daily for 24 months ( 99921 , 103197 ). ...when used topically. Berberine ointment has been applied with apparent safety for up to 20 days ( 13526 ). CHILDREN: Likely Unsafe when used orally in newborns. Berberine can cause kernicterus, particularly in preterm neonates with hyperbilirubinemia ( 2589 ). It is unclear if berberine is safe in older children. PREGNANCY: Likely Unsafe when used orally. Berberine is thought to cross the placenta and may cause harm to the fetus. Kernicterus has developed in newborn infants exposed to berberine ( 2589 ). Also, berberine may stimulate uterine contractions ( 91951 ). LACTATION: Likely Unsafe when used orally. Berberine can be transferred to the infant through breast milk ( 2589 ).",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: Berberine has been used in doses of up to 2 grams daily for 8 weeks. It is most often used in doses of 0.4-1.5 grams daily for a duration of 2 weeks to 2 years. In most cases these total daily dosages are divided into 2 or 3 doses throughout the day. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Ophthalmic:Berberine has been used as 0.2% or 0.5% eye drops applied three times daily for 1-8 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information.

Preliminary clinical research shows that berberine can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) activity and reduce the metabolism of dextromethorphan ( 34279 ). This may increase the effects and side effects of dextromethorphan. more LOSARTAN (Cozaar) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Berberine might reduce the therapeutic effects of losartan by decreasing its conversion to its active form.

Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, berberine might increase the therapeutic and adverse effects of metformin. In vitro and animal studies show that berberine can increase the systemic exposure and half-life of metformin, potentially increasing metformin's effects and side effects. This interaction seems to be most apparent when berberine is administered 2 hours prior to metformin. Taking berberine and metformin at the same time does not appear to increase systemic exposure to metformin ( 103195 ). more MIDAZOLAM (Versed) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Berberine can reduce metabolism of midazolam, which might increase the risk of severe adverse effects.

Following a reduction of the tacrolimus dose to 3 mg daily, blood levels of tacrolimus decreased to 12 ng/mL ( 91954 ). more",
  "mechanism_text": "General Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid and a primary constituent of several plants including European barberry, goldenseal, goldthread, Oregon grape, phellodendron, and tree turmeric ( 2589 , 12426 , 14003 , 32322 , 33598 , 34206 , 33658 , 33713 , 34207 , 34210 )( 34211 , 34221 , 104508 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Two meta-analyses of a total of 19 clinical studies show that berberine can cause a small reduction in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a key marker of systemic inflammation ( 103196 , 104508 , 111362 ). A larger reduction in CRP was reported with berberine in a meta-analysis of 52 clinical studies involving patients with metabolic syndrome or other metabolic disorders. Berberine also appears to reduce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6), levels in these patients ( 110102 , 111362 ). Animal research shows that berberine can reduce chemical-induced swelling, possibly by inhibiting the expression of various cytokines ( 13529 , 33639 , 34298 ). Preliminary and human research suggests that berberine blocks production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL1)-beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, possibly by blocking nuclear factor-kappaB, the transcription factor responsible for regulation of cytokine production. As a result, berberine has potential usefulness in treating alcoholic liver disease, which is associated with increased levels of IL1-beta and TNF-alpha ( 13522 , 33674 , 34258 , 99922 ). Berberine also appears to decrease the production of IL-8, which is involved in inflammatory processes ( 33592 ). Preliminary research suggests berberine selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression ( 12488 , 33582 , 34258 ). Anticancer effects In vitro research shows that berberine can reduce the proliferation of leukemia, myeloma, oral squamous cell, esophageal, prostate, gastric, cervical, and breast cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and/or causing apoptosis ( 34196 , 34202 , 34219 , 34222 , 34229 , 34233 , 34236 , 34237 , 34238 , 34315 )( 34323 , 95716 ). Some preliminary research suggests that berberine can also inhibit the progression of leukemia, colon adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, astrocytoma, and glioblastoma multiform cells by inhibiting the activity of arylamine N-acetyltransferase ( 34197 , 34198 , 34206 , 34214 ). Arylamine N-acetyltransferase has been shown to be involved in the growth and chemotherapy drug resistance of cancer ( 91947 ). Berberine also appears to inhibit tumor angiogenesis in vitro by inducing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha repression ( 34226 ). In addition to preventing the growth and proliferation of cancer cells, berberine may also inhibit the ability of cancer to metastasize. Evidence from animal research shows that berberine can inhibit the metastasis of lung cancer to the lymph nodes ( 33587 ). In vitro research also shows that berberine can inhibit the metastasis of melanoma cells ( 34284 ). In addition to its anticancer effects, berberine appears to enhance the effects of conventional cancer treatments, including radiation and chemotherapy, against some types of cancer. In vitro research shows that berberine can enhance the sensitivity of glioblastoma multiforme cells to ionizing radiation ( 34227 ). Other in vitro research shows that treatment of tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant cells with berberine and tamoxifen enhances G1 phase arrest and activates apoptosis compared to treatment with tamoxifen alone. Berberine is thought to increase the effectiveness of tamoxifen against breast cancer cells by inducing upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21, which is involved with breast cancer growth and development and plays a role in tamoxifen resistance ( 95716 ). Antidiabetic effects The blood-glucose lowering effect of berberine has been attributed to its ability to increase insulin receptor expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with type 2 diabetes ( 34265 ). Also, evidence from in vitro and animal research suggests that berberine increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity ( 34240 , 34242 , 34243 ). Activation of AMPK can stimulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscles, increase the oxidation of fatty acids in adipose tissue, and reduce the production of glucose in the liver ( 91948 ). Other evidence from animal research suggests that berberine increases glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion ( 34254 ). GLP-1 is an incretin that plays a role in the maintenance of glycemic control ( 91949 ). Some animal research also shows that berberine can increase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha and PPAR-delta expression, although berberine also appears to reduce PPAR-gamma expression in the liver of diabetic rats ( 34249 ). In addition to lowering blood glucose, berberine might also inhibit aldose reductase ( 13520 ). This might prevent nerve and eye damage in people with diabetes. Antidiarrheal effects Preliminary research in healthy individuals suggests that the antidiarrheal effect of berberine results from its ability to delay small intestinal transit time ( 33659 ). Also, evidence from animal research shows that berberine can inhibit the intestinal secretion of water, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate in response to enterotoxin from Vibrio cholera and Escherichia coli ( 33596 , 33651 , 33654 , 33655 , 33714 , 34309 ). Antilipemic effects Berberine is theorized to reduce lipids by enhancing hepatic uptake of low-density lipoprotein particles by inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), increasing fecal cholesterol excretion, improving hepatic cholesterol turnover, and decreasing intestinal cholesterol absorption ( 111363 ). Animal research shows that the hypocholesterolemic effects of berberine result from its ability to inhibit cholesterol absorption and increase bile acid synthesis ( 34264 ). Other animal research shows that berberine may improve lipid dysregulation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in the liver and muscles, thereby exerting effects on fatty acid oxidation, glucose generation, and insulin resistance ( 34257 , 111364 ). Antimicrobial effects Berberine has antimicrobial effects including antibacterial, antifungal, and some antimycobacterial and antiprotozoal activity ( 7258 , 7259 ). Berberine has activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Shigella boydii, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum gypseum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporotrichum schenckii, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, Trichomonas vaginalis, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium paraputrificum, Aspergillus species, Leishmania donovani, and Plasmodium falciparum ( 2530 , 2583 , 2587 , 2588 , 7258 , 7259 , 8012 , 12428 , 33690 , 33702 )( 33703 , 33705 , 34200 , 34208 , 34312 , 34334 ). Preliminary research suggests berberine might inhibit bacterial sortase, a protein responsible for anchoring gram-positive bacteria to cell membranes ( 13540 ). The activity of berberine against Plasmodium falciparum might result from its ability to inhibit telomerase activity ( 34213 ). Antioxidant effects Evidence from animal research shows that berberine increases the activity of superoxide dismutase and decreases levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide anion ( 34248 , 34252 ). Antiplatelet effects Evidence from animal research shows that berberine inhibits platelet aggregation ( 33660 ). In vitro research suggests that the antiplatelet effects of berberine result from its ability to inhibit the synthesis of thromboxane A2 ( 91950 ). Bone effects Evidence from animal research suggests that berberine can inhibit parathyroid hormone-stimulated bone resorption ( 33580 ). In doses of 30-50 mg/kg daily, berberine has demonstrated an ability to prevent a decrease in bone mineral density of lumbar vertebra in ovariectomized rats and induce apoptosis of osteoclastic cells ( 33580 ). Cardiovascular effects In humans, intravenous infusion of berberine appears to improve cardiac performance in patients with severe congestive heart failure ( 91951 ). The effect has been attributed to the ability of berberine to induce peripheral vasodilation and inotropic stimulation ( 33642 ). The positive inotropic effects of berberine have been confirmed in various animal models ( 33637 , 33642 , 33685 , 33708 , 33710 ). Also, in humans, oral berberine reduced myocardial injury, possibly by inhibiting the cellular pathway that causes apoptosis ( 99922 ). Berberine also appears to have an antihypertensive effect, which has been attributed to its ability to block alpha-adrenergic activity ( 13520 ). Other evidence from in vitro research suggests that berberine possesses partial alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist activity similar to that of clonidine ( 33606 ). Evidence from animal research shows that berberine has an antiarrhythmic effect and can restore ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm ( 33608 , 33636 , 33685 ). Berberine may increase the elasticity of the small arteries by increasing the mobilization of circulating endothelial progenitor cells ( 34244 ). Other evidence from animal research suggests that berberine can reduce oxidative stress and vascular inflammation by activating AMP-activated protein kinase activity ( 34281 ). Evidence from animal research shows that berberine can improve neointima formation following balloon injury in rats. This suggests that berberine might be able to help control restenosis after balloon angioplasty ( 34231 ). Endocrine effects In women with polycystic ovary syndrome, berberine hydrochloride has been shown to increase sex hormone binding globulin levels and decrease the free androgen index ( 34282 ). Gastroprotective effects Berberine appears to reduce the secretion of gastric acid ( 13537 ). Hepatoprotective effects Preliminary research suggests berberine might protect the liver from hepatotoxins. In an animal model, berberine reduced N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced liver injury, as evidence by the attenuation of increased liver weight, elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, and increased glutathione S-transferase levels ( 13521 ). Other animal research shows that berberine prevents elevations in levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) when administered prior to exposure to acetaminophen or carbon tetrachloride ( 13519 ). Other animal research suggests that berberine has antifibrotic effects and can increase the excretion of bilirubin from the liver. This suggests that berberine may have beneficial effects in treating liver fibrosis ( 34302 ). Muscle relaxant effects Evidence from animal research suggests that berberine can block acetylcholine-induced contraction of smooth muscles ( 33646 , 33692 ).",
