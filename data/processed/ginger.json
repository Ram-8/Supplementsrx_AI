  "overview_text": "Ginger is a plant native to warmer parts of Asia, but is now cultivated in parts of South America, Africa, and the Middle East. The rhizome of the plant is used in food and medicine. Ginger is used for flavor in foods and beverages, and a fragrance in soaps and cosmetics. In medicine, ginger is traditionally used for malaria, snake bites, toothache, and as a galactagogue, diaphoretic, analgesic, antitussive, anti-flatulent, antacid, and diuretic.",
  "effectiveness_text": "Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Dysmenorrhea. In people with dysmenorrhea, taking oral ginger seems to reduce pain. Clinical research shows that ginger might be comparable to ibuprofen or mefenamic acid. In addition, taking ginger seems to be beneficial when used as an adjunct to mefenamic acid 250 mg twice daily. Clinical research in individuals at least 15 years of age shows that ginger can reduce pain from dysmenorrhea. Clinical studies show that taking ginger powder 500-2000 mg daily usually for the first 3-4 days of a menstrual cycle modestly decreases pain severity by an average of 2.3-2.7 points on a 10-point scale when compared to control groups ( 89889 , 89899 , 91139 , 91892 , 96255 , 106077 ). However, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking ginger does not reduce pain duration when compared with placebo ( 106077 ). Clinical research also shows that ginger might be as effective as some anti-inflammatory agents. Taking a specific ginger extract (Zintoma, Goldaru) 250 mg four times daily for 3 days at the beginning of the menstrual period or until pain relief improves symptoms similarly to ibuprofen or mefenamic acid ( 17931 , 96259 , 106077 ). Also, taking a ginger extract 200 mg four times daily for 3-4 days at the beginning of pain is equally effective to taking Novafen, a combination of acetaminophen, caffeine, and ibuprofen ( 99444 ). Ginger also seems to improve pain when given as an adjunct to anti-inflammatory agents. A small clinical study in young females with dysmenorrhea shows that adding ginger (Vomigone, Dineh Co.) 500 mg daily to mefenamic acid 250 mg twice daily for 5 days further reduces pain when compared with taking mefenamic acid alone ( 102464 ). more Osteoarthritis. Most clinical research shows that taking ginger extract by mouth improves pain in some patients with osteoarthritis. Topical ginger, on the other hand, has not shown benefit for knee osteoarthritis in low quality research. Meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking ginger extract 500-1000 mg daily for 3-12 weeks can modestly improve pain when compared with placebo in some patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip ( 96253 , 103357 ). However, a meta-analysis of two clinical studies shows that taking ginger extract about 500 mg daily for 6 weeks does not have an effect on function ( 103357 ). One small clinical trial in patients with mild osteoarthritis of the knee also shows that taking steamed golden ginger extract 480 mg daily for 12 weeks moderately improves pain and functional scores when compared with placebo ( 114784 ). Some clinical research has also compared ginger to conventional drug treatment. In one clinical trial, there was no significant difference between ginger extract 30 mg daily and ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily for one month in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee ( 17930 ). However, taking a specific ginger extract (Eurovita Extract 33; EV ext-33) orally 170 mg three times daily for 3 weeks was significantly less effective than ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily for reducing pain ( 7048 ). Since ginger is thought to take several weeks for significant benefit, this trial might not have lasted long enough. Ginger has also been compared with diclofenac. When used orally as 1500 mg daily in two divided doses, ginger is less effective than oral diclofenac 100 mg daily in two divided doses, or the combination of ginger and diclofenac, for 12 weeks ( 89898 ). Various studies have evaluated formulations containing ginger with other ingredients. These combinations have all been shown to improve osteoarthritis pain, and in some cases, functionality. Studied formulations include ginger (Eurovita Extract 35; EV ext-35) 340 mg with glucosamine (Zinaxin glucosamine, Ferrosan AS) 1000 mg daily for 4 weeks, a ginger extract with an alpinia (Alpinia galanga) extract (Eurovita Extract 77; EV ext-77) 255 mg twice daily for 6 weeks, a ginger extract with curcuminoids, and extracts of devil's claw, Boswellia serrata, and celery (Tregocel) for 36 weeks, or Ayurvedic shunthi-guduchi formulations containing ginger, Indian gooseberry, and Tinospora cordifolia, either with or without Boswellia serrata ( 7084 , 18210 , 89557 , 106078 ). However, it's too early to know if the effects of these combination agents are associated with ginger or other ingredients in the formulations. Topical ginger, alone or in combination with other ingredients, has also been studied for knee osteoarthritis. Although a meta-analysis of two randomized clinical trials shows no evidence of benefit of topical ginger for pain and disability when compared with placebo or standard therapy ( 103357 ), some benefits have been shown in individual preliminary studies ( 20340 , 20341 , 89897 , 96668 , 97537 , 97542 ). These trials have used a specific gel containing ginger and plai 4% by weight (Plygersic gel, Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research) 4 grams/day in four divided doses for 6 weeks ( 89897 ), an ointment composed of ginger, cinnamon, mastic (Saghez), and sesame oil twice daily for 6 weeks ( 20340 ), or one gram of ginger extract 5% (standardized to 11.18% of 6-gingerol) in a nanostructure lipid carrier three times daily for up to 12 weeks to the affected knee ( 96668 , 97537 ). Some studies have used ginger essential oil in a massage oil, alone or with sweet orange essential oil or standard therapy, twice weekly for 3 or 6 weeks ( 20341 , 97542 ). more Pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral ginger seems to reduce the severity of nausea and vomiting in some people during pregnancy. Ginger seems to be more effective than placebo, comparable to vitamin B6 or dimenhydrinate, and less effective than metoclopramide. Although most clinical studies are small and have methodological limitations, the available research shows that ginger is more effective than placebo, and comparable to vitamin B6 or dimenhydrinate ( 721 , 1922 , 5343 , 11346 , 13071 , 16306 , 20312 , 20315 , 90103 , 91201 , 102462 ). Although ginger is comparable to dimenhydrinate for reducing symptoms of morning sickness, it seems to take about 3 days to reduce vomiting episodes compared to 1 day with dimenhydrinate ( 16305 ). In addition, clinical research shows that ginger is less effective than metoclopramide at relieving nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy ( 20315 ). Ginger doses of 500 to 2500 mg daily, divided into two to four daily doses for 3 days to 3 weeks, have been used in clinical research ( 721 , 5343 , 16305 , 16306 , 20312 , 20315 , 90103 , 91201 ). The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) considers ginger capsules 250 mg 4 times daily a first-line nonpharmacological treatment option for pregnancy-induced nausea based on limited evidence. However, there is no evidence that ginger reduces vomiting ( 111601 ). more Possibly Ineffective Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Most clinical research shows that oral ginger does not reduce acute or delayed CINV. The effect of ginger might depend on the dose, the other antiemetics used, or the specific chemotherapy regimen. Most clinical research shows that taking ginger as adjunct to adequate antiemetic therapy does not reduce DELAYED CINV when compared with antiemetic therapy alone ( 20316 , 96260 , 89891 , 96675 , 97538 , 97541 , 101760 , 102461 , 113616 ). Clinical research from meta-analyses and most individual clinical studies also show that taking ginger 0.5-3.5 grams as an adjunct to standard antiemetic therapy does not reduce the incidence or severity of ACUTE CINV when compared with antiemetic therapy alone ( 89891 , 96675 , 101760 , 102461 , 102466 , 113616 ). However, conflicting results exist from some individual clinical studies ( 20316 , 102466 ). These individual studies evaluated powdered ginger root or liquid extract of ginger root 0.5-2 grams taken in two to four divided doses daily, starting on either the day of or 3 days before chemotherapy and continuing for 3-5 days after chemotherapy initiation ( 20316 , 102466 ). Also, one small study shows that ginger in doses of 1 gram or less for more than 3 days reduces the likelihood of acute vomiting by 60% ( 101760 ). More research is needed to confirm the efficacy of this lower dose. Reasons for the conflicting results are unclear, but several theories have been postulated. One theory is that ginger might help reduce CINV associated with some, but not all, chemotherapy regimens. One preliminary clinical study shows that ginger 500 mg twice daily for 3 days reduces vomiting in patients receiving cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, but not in patients also receiving 5-fluorouracil or docetaxel ( 96251 ). However, since there is limited evidence supporting this theory, additional research is needed to confirm. Another theory is that ginger helps when used with certain antiemetic drugs, but not others. For example, ginger seems to help in cases when optimal antiemetic therapy, such as 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, is not available. Small clinical studies show that ginger reduces the severity of acute nausea when compared with prochlorperazine or metoclopramide, both of which are suboptimal antiemetic therapy for CINV ( 89891 ). Another small study shows that ginger is comparable to metoclopramide for improving delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea ( 13244 ). On the other hand, several studies show that taking ginger 0.5-2 grams daily along with antiemetic therapy that includes aprepitant does NOT improve acute or delayed CINV ( 20318 , 89891 , 96251 , 96675 ). In fact, one study found an association between concomitant use of ginger 2 grams daily with aprepitant and worsened severity of delayed nausea. Ginger is hypothesized to decrease the absorption of aprepitant and reduce its effectiveness for delayed nausea ( 20318 , 96675 ). However, this effect has not been replicated, and aprepitant serum levels were not measured to confirm this hypothesis. Finally, many of the studies showing a benefit of ginger for CINV when used as an adjunct to standard antiemetic therapy are considered to be methodologically flawed ( 20317 , 96252 , 96677 ). For instance, one study using powdered ginger root 1-2 grams daily during the first three days of chemotherapy in children and adults ( 20317 ) has been criticized for inaccurately representing data ( 89891 ). Other studies of ginger 500 mg twice daily for up to 10 days used questionable methods to measure outcomes and usually did not differentiate between acute and delayed CINV ( 96252 , 96677 ). Ginger essential oil aromatherapy has also been evaluated. One small study shows that using two drops of ginger essential oil on an aromatherapy necklace for 2 minutes daily for 5 days, starting on the first day of chemotherapy, reduces acute nausea, but not vomiting or delayed nausea, when compared with placebo in females with breast cancer taking standard antiemetics including granisetron, dexamethasone, and metoclopramide ( 96256 ). more Exercise-induced muscle soreness. Most research shows that oral ginger in single or multiple doses does not prevent or treat exercise-induced muscle soreness. Two small studies in healthy adults show that single doses of ginger supplements do not seem to reduce muscle soreness from exercise. Taking capsules of ground ginger 2 grams, 30 minutes before a 30-minute cycling bout, or 24-48 hours after eccentric exercise, does not reduce muscle pain during exercise or within one hour of ingestion when compared with placebo ( 17932 , 17934 ). Taking multiple doses also does not seem to help. One small study in healthy adults shows that taking capsules with ginger powder 4 grams daily for 5 days before high-intensity eccentric exercise does not reduce muscle soreness over 4 days when compared with placebo ( 96258 ). Another small study in healthy adults shows that taking capsules of heated or raw ground ginger 2 grams daily for 8 days prior to eccentric exercise, and continuing supplementation for 3 more days, might modestly reduce muscle soreness 24 hours post-exercise, but not at later time points, when compared with placebo ( 17933 , 96258 ). Ginger has also been tested in combination with other ingredients. One small study in healthy adults shows that taking a specific combination product (ReWin(d), Natural Origins) containing a 4:3 ratio of ginger and annatto powder, 2 grams in divided doses daily for 4 weeks before eccentric exercise and continuing for 3 days after exercise, may modestly reduce muscle pain 48 hours after exercise but not at other time points ( 105057 ). This study was funded by the supplement manufacturer. more Motion sickness. Most research shows that oral ginger does not prevent or treat motion sickness. Most clinical research shows that taking ginger 500-1000 mg up to 4 hours prior to travel does not prevent motion sickness ( 7624 , 7625 , 20330 , 20331 ). Some patients report subjective feelings of improvement, but in many studies objective measures did not significantly improve ( 7400 ). However, one clinical trial suggests that ginger is more effective than dimenhydrinate at reducing gastrointestinal distress associated with motion sickness ( 20332 ). Another clinical study seems to show that taking ginger 1-2 grams as a single dose reduces nausea severity and increases the latency before the onset of nausea caused by simulated motion sickness when compared to baseline ( 20333 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Some small clinical studies show that giving ginger with tube feeds to hospitalized patients might reduce the duration of serious sequelae from ARDS. A small clinical trial in adults with ARDS shows that administering ginger extract 120 mg in three divided doses daily via nasogastric tubing for 21 days increases the number of ventilator-free days and the amount of feeding tolerated and decreases the number of intensive care unit (ICU) days when compared with placebo. However, it does not seem to improve overall mortality ( 20343 ). Also, another small clinical study shows that adding ginger extract 120 mg to tube feeds in three divided doses daily for 8-21 days improves blood oxygen levels by 13% to 20%, as well as the ability of the lungs to expand by 17%, when compared with a coconut oil placebo. The duration of mechanical ventilation and stay in the ICU also improved. However, ginger does not affect other measurements of lung function or physical organ damage in these patients ( 89886 ). more Allergic rhinitis (hay fever). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial in allergic rhinitis. A small clinical trial shows that taking ginger extract 500 mg daily for 6 weeks is as effective as loratadine 10 mg daily for reducing nasal symptoms of allergic rhinitis ( 103359 ). more Antiretroviral-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral ginger seems to improve nausea and vomiting in patients using antiretroviral agents. A small clinical study in patients with HIV shows that taking ginger 0.5 grams twice daily, 30 minutes prior to each dose of antiretroviral for 14 days, reduces the relative likelihood of nausea and vomiting by about 63% and 79%, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 89887 ). more Asthma. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for asthma, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition. Atopic dermatitis (eczema). Topical ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A moderate-sized clinical trial in adults and children with eczema shows that applying a combination topical product containing ginger and cannabidiol twice daily for 5 days moderately improves eczema scores, including erythema, dryness, itching, and scaling, when compared to baseline. It is unclear if this effect is due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group ( 114783 ). more Back pain. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for back pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition. Burns. Although there has been interest in using topical ginger for burns, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition. Cancer-related anorexia. It is unclear if oral ginger improves appetite in people with cancer-related anorexia. A small clinical study in patients with cancer-related anorexia and cachexia shows that taking a capsule containing ginger 1650 mg daily for 14 days improves nausea, appetite, reflux, dysmotility, and other gastrointestinal symptoms when compared to baseline ( 102460 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of comparator group. more Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product (AKL1, AKL International Ltd.) containing ginkgo extract, ginger, and Picrorhiza kurroa twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve respiratory symptoms when compared with placebo in patients with COPD ( 89702 ). Another moderate-sized clinical study in adults with COPD shows that taking a combination product containing extracts of ginger, alpinia, cardamom, cinnamon, and saffron in honey 3 times daily for 8 weeks improves confidence in leaving home and the ratio of forced exploratory volume per second to forced vital capacity of the lungs (FEV1/FVC) when compared with placebo. However, the combination product does not improve most measures of respiratory function or symptoms such as cough, phlegm, chest tightness, dyspnea, reduced energy levels, sleeping disorders, or activity limitations when compared with placebo ( 111542 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. more Colic. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for colic, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition. Constipation. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for constipation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear whether oral ginger is beneficial for patients with COVID-19. Clinical research in adults hospitalized with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection shows that taking ginger 1.5 grams twice daily orally until hospital discharge reduces length of stay from around 8.5 days to 6 days, when compared with placebo. The strongest effect is seen in males over 60 years of age ( 110005 ). The relevance of these results is reduced by a lack of blinding, and the fact that the subjects were initially asymptomatic. Another small study in adults with COVID-19 treated in the community shows that taking ginger 1000 mg three times a day for 7 days does not improve viral clearance, oxygen saturation, or respiratory rate when compared with placebo. Taking ginger also did not reduce the risk of hospitalization ( 114779 ). The efficacy of ginger for treating COVID-19 has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. In adults with uncomplicated, moderate COVID-19, taking a combination of ginger, turmeric, ashwagandha, and boswellia (BV-4051, Artovid-20), 1776 mg twice daily orally for 14 days in addition to standard care and starting 48-96 hours after symptom onset, reduces the mean duration of symptoms from about 8 days to 7 days, when compared with placebo ( 109899 ). A small open-label study in adults with confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19 shows that taking ginger 1000 mg and ashwagandha 500 mg twice daily for 15 days, along with conventional therapy, leads to a 13.8-fold and 2.6-fold increase in the relative rate of clinical cure at 7 days and 15 days, respectively, when compared with conventional therapy alone. Taking this combination also appears to reduce time to recovery by around 6 days but does not improve the rate of negative COVID-19 tests, chest imaging findings, viral clearance, serum antibodies, or other measures of disease progression when compared with conventional therapy alone ( 112094 ). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of blinding, and the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, ashwagandha, or the combination. more Diabetes. Some preliminary clinical studies suggest that oral ginger might have a small beneficial effect on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes. Meta-analyses of several small clinical trials in adults with type 2 diabetes show that taking ginger 1200-3000 mg daily for 8-13 weeks reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by around 0.6% to 1% and fasting blood glucose by 19-21 mg/dL when compared with placebo ( 96680 , 107898 ). However, a recent meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking ginger 1200-2000 mg daily for 4-12 weeks does not improve HbA1c or fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo ( 114780 ). The reasons for these discordant results are not entirely clear, but they are likely related to heterogeneity of the included populations, treatment dose, and duration of follow up. Additionally, a small clinical study in adults with diabetes on hemodialysis for end stage renal disease shows that taking ginger powder 2000 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose and measures of insulin resistance, but not serum insulin levels, when compared with placebo ( 111543 ). In patients with gestational diabetes at weeks 24-28 of pregnancy, clinical research shows that taking ginger 1500 mg daily in three divided doses for 6 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and measures of insulin resistance by a small amount when compared with placebo, with no effect on postprandial glucose levels ( 103358 ). more Diabetic neuropathy. Topical ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical trial in adults treated with gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy of the foot shows that applying a combination balm containing ginger, menthol, camphor, and other ingredients three times a day for 4 weeks moderately improves pain scores when compared with a placebo balm without ginger but containing menthol, camphor, and other ingredients.( 114781 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. more Diarrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for various types of diarrhea, including cholera and acute bacterial dysentery, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for these conditions. Dry mouth. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with ginger extract is beneficial for dry mouth. In patients with dry mouth related to type 2 diabetes, clinical research shows that use of a ginger extract 25% mouthwash 20 mL three times daily for 14 days modestly reduces symptoms of dry mouth when compared with rinsing with a saline control mouthwash ( 106068 ). Although this study was indicated as being triple-blind, it is unclear how the taste of ginger was masked. more Dyspepsia. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for dyspepsia. In patients with dyspepsia, a small clinical trial shows that a single dose of ginger root powder 1.2 grams, taken 1 hour prior to eating, does not reduce abdominal discomfort when compared with placebo. However, it increases the rate of gastric emptying ( 20325 ). more Erectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for erectile dysfunction. Preliminary clinical research in middle-aged males with ED shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product (Revactin, MD Concepts LLC) containing ginger root 250 mg, muira puama 250 mg, guarana 250 mg, and L-citrulline 800 mg twice daily for 3 months improves scores related to erectile function and intercourse satisfaction, but does not improve sexual desire or orgasmic function scores, when compared to baseline ( 103224 ). This study is limited by the lack of a placebo control, the use of per-protocol analysis, and a high dropout rate. In fact, 44% of patients withdrew in order to resume use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. Further, it is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. more Hangover. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for managing symptoms of hangover. Preliminary clinical research shows that use of a decoction containing a combination of ginger 6 grams, pith of Citrus tangerine 3 grams, and brown sugar decreases symptoms of alcohol hangovers, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, when compared with placebo. The decoction was taken once 5 hours prior to drinking alcohol or four times after drinking alcohol ( 20320 ). more Hyperlipidemia. Oral ginger may be modestly beneficial for some patients with hyperlipidemia. A meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research in adults with and without hyperlipidemia shows that taking ginger 200-3000 mg orally daily for 2-24 weeks reduces triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 12 mg/dL and 5 mg/dL, respectively, and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 1 mg/dL when compared with placebo ( 109521 ). However, the validity of this study is limited by high heterogeneity. A clinical study in adults with hyperlipidemia shows that taking ginger powder 1 gram three times daily for 45 days reduces triglyceride and cholesterol levels by an additional 36% and 90%, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 20327 ). more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for lowering blood pressure. A preliminary clinical study in patients with diabetes and elevated systolic blood pressure shows that drinking black tea containing ginger 3 grams three times daily for 8 weeks does not reduce blood pressure by a clinically significant amount when compared with plain black tea ( 96669 ). more Hypothyroidism. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial in patients with hypothyroidism. A small clinical study in patients with primary hypothyroidism who are stabilized on thyroid hormone therapy shows that taking ginger powder 500 mg twice daily for 30 days improves symptoms associated with hypothyroidism, including cold intolerance, constipation, dizziness, dry skin, weight gain, and concentration and memory issues, when compared with placebo. However, ginger supplementation does not seem to improve hair loss, hearing, nail fragility, speech, or feelings of depression in these patients ( 107903 ). more Insect bite. It is unclear if topical ginger is beneficial for reducing the size of insect bites. Preliminary clinical research shows that a topical application of Trikatu, which contains ginger, long pepper, and black pepper extracts with 0.074% piperine and 0.046% gingerol, does not reduce the papule size associated with mosquito bites when compared with a control compound containing the same base ingredients of camphor 2%, menthol 2%, and eucalyptus oil 4% ( 89893 ). more Intraoperative nausea and vomiting (IONV). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for preventing IONV. Clinical research in individuals undergoing elective C-section and receiving cimetidine and metoclopramide, shows that taking ginger 1 gram orally 30 minutes prior to anesthesia reduces the number of episodes of intraoperative nausea, but not vomiting, when compared with placebo ( 89890 ). In other clinical research in adults undergoing elective surgical procedures, adding ginger to a high calorie drink consumed pre-operatively reduces the incidence of nausea from 40% to 10%, and the incidence of vomiting from 25% to 10% when compared with the high calorie drink alone ( 110007 ). The validity of these results is unclear as only patients were blinded to the treatment group. more Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Oral ginger might reduce symptoms of IBS when used in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical trial shows that taking ginger 1-2 grams daily for 28 days does not improve symptoms or the number of responders when compared with placebo ( 90102 ). However, some research shows that ginger might be beneficial in some patients when used along with other herbal ingredients. Taking a capsule containing ginger, boswellia, and yarrow three times daily for 30 days reduces the frequency and severity of abdominal pain, as well as the severity of bloating, when compared with placebo in females, but not males, with mild to moderate IBS ( 96673 ). Another clinical study shows that taking an herbal mixture containing ginger, English horsemint, and purple nut sedge tuber three times daily for 8 weeks improves IBS symptoms including abdominal pain, stool frequency, stool consistency, incomplete evacuation, and urgency, when compared to baseline; these improvements are similar to those achieved by taking mebeverine 135 mg three times daily ( 89900 ). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. more Joint pain. Oral ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product (Instaflex Joint Support, Direct Digital) containing glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg, methylsufonlylmethane 500 mg, white willow bark extract 250 mg, ginger root concentrate 50 mg, Boswellia extract 125 mg, turmeric root extract 50 mg, cayenne 40 m H.U. 50 mg, and hyaluronic acid 4 mg in three divided doses daily for 8 weeks reduces joint pain severity by 37% compared to only 16% with placebo. However, it does not improve joint stiffness or function when compared with placebo ( 89560 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. more Menopausal symptoms. Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for menopausal symptoms such as insomnia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this purpose. Menorrhagia. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for menorrhagia. Preliminary clinical research in healthy adults experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding shows that taking ginger 250 mg three times daily for 4 days, starting the day prior to menstruation, and repeating for three menstrual cycles, reduces the amount of menstrual bleeding when compared with placebo ( 96672 ). more Migraine headache. Small clinical studies suggest that oral ginger may modestly reduce migraine pain severity and duration. However, taking ginger doesn't seem to PREVENT migraines. Ginger does not seem to be effective for the prevention of migraines. Clinical research in patients with episodic migraine shows that taking ginger extract 200 mg three times daily for 3 months does not reduce the number of migraine attacks, the use of analgesics, or the number of days with pain, any more than taking placebo ( 101761 ). However, ginger may be beneficial for the treatment of migraine. Clinical research shows that taking ginger extract 400 mg orally in the emergency room along with intravenous ketoprofen 100 mg reduces pain over the next 2 hours when compared with ketoprofen and placebo. This combination also resulted in an overall better response with a higher likelihood of having no or mild pain with treatment ( 101762 ). Taking ginger 250 mg at the onset of a common migraine headache seems to be as effective as taking sumatriptan 50 mg for reducing headache severity within two hours of treatment ( 89894 ). Furthermore, a combination of ginger and feverfew (GelStat Migraine, GelStat Corporation; LipiGesic M, PuraMed BioScience), administered sublingually at the onset of a migraine attack, decreases the duration and intensity of migraine pain when compared with placebo ( 19357 , 22602 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, feverfew, or the combination. Feverfew alone has demonstrated some benefit in treating migraines. more Multiple sclerosis (MS). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for MS. A small clinical study in adults with MS shows that taking ginger 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks reduces disability scores and improves physical and psychological quality of life scores when compared with placebo ( 111541 ). Another small clinical study in adults with relapsing-remitting MS shows that taking ginger 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks reduces the frequency and severity of nausea and constipation and the severity but not frequency of bloating when compared with placebo. However, no improvement was noted in other gastrointestinal symptoms of MS including abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea, dysphagia, gas, or heartburn ( 113614 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for NAFLD. A small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking ginger 1000 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves liver steatosis scores but not liver fibrosis scores when compared with placebo. Ginger also modestly improves levels of alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase but not aspartate aminotransferase ( 113615 ). However, it is unclear whether any improvements are clinically significant. Another small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking ginger root 1500 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and fasting blood glucose levels, but does not affect triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, insulin resistance, blood pressure, or fatty liver index, when compared with placebo ( 102465 ). more Obesity. Oral ginger has primarily been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Although some individual research disagrees ( 40802 ), a meta-analysis and most individual clinical trials show that taking ginger alone or with other ingredients does not reduce weight by a clinically significant amount when compared with placebo in overweight or obese individuals ( 20346 , 20347 , 96676 , 109521 ). Ginger has been taken alone or in combination with green tea and capsaicin; rhubarb, astragalus, red sage, turmeric, and gallic acid (Number Ten); or raspberry ketone (Razberi K, Integrity Nutraceuticals), caffeine, capsicum extract (Capsimax, OmniActive Health Technologies), bitter orange fruit (Advantra Z, Nutratech Inc), L-theanine, and black pepper fruit extract (Biperine, Sabinsa Corporation) (Prograde Metabolism) ( 20346 , 20347 , 40802 , 96676 ). Due to the various other ingredients contained in available formulations, any effect from ginger is unclear. more Oral mucositis. Topical ginger, as a mouthwash, has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in patients undergoing chemotherapy shows that using 10 mL of a mouthwash containing ginger for 14 days does not improve oral mucositis severity or pain when compared with saline, although a modest improvement in severity was noted after 7 days of treatment with the ginger containing mouthwash. The mouthwash contained ginger 4% and honey 7% and was used for 2 minutes 3 times daily ( 116439 ). The interpretation of these results is limited by the low overall mucositis severity reported during the study. Also, it is unclear if any effect is due to ginger, honey, or the combination. more Parturition. It is unclear if bathing in a ginger bath is beneficial for shortening the duration of labor. Preliminary clinical research shows that bathing in 228 liters of water containing 4 drops of ginger essential oil does not shorten the duration of labor when compared with a regular bath ( 20345 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for females with PCOS. Preliminary clinical research in females with PCOS shows that taking ginger 500 mg three times daily orally for 8 weeks decreases body weight, body mass index, and levels of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, when compared with placebo. It does not affect testosterone levels ( 110006 ). more Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Evidence for the use of oral ginger for preventing PONV is inconclusive and conflicting. Reasons for the conflicting findings may relate to the ginger formulation used and the outcomes measured. It is unclear if ginger aromatherapy is beneficial for PONV. Some individual clinical studies, as well as a large, recent meta-analysis of the available clinical research, show that taking ginger by mouth 1 hour prior to surgery does not reduce the incidence of 24-hour PONV ( 3452 , 3453 , 17369 , 99445 ). Also, the meta-analysis found that, although ginger reduces the severity of PONV when measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS), it does not reduce the severity of PONV when measured on a verbal descriptive scale (VDS). Furthermore, ginger does not reduce the use of rescue antiemetic medications ( 99445 ). However, some small, individual clinical studies and a meta-analysis of older clinical research show that taking ginger by mouth prior to surgery reduces the incidence of 24-hour PONV by up to 16% to 38% ( 722 , 723 , 1919 , 13237 , 20336 , 20338 , 20339 ). In addition, large clinical trials show that the frequency and severity of PONV 2-6 hours after surgery are similar when ginger 1 gram is given orally or when medications such as metoclopramide or dexmedetomidine are given intravenously prior to undergoing anesthesia ( 103356 , 103360 ). However, taking ginger prior to general anesthesia, in combination with other antiemetics like dexamethasone or cimetidine and metoclopramide, does not seem to reduce nausea and vomiting when compared with the other medications alone ( 20337 , 89890 ). In contrast, other research shows that powdered ginger 1-2 grams 30-60 minutes before induction of anesthesia has been used in most studies showing benefit, occasionally followed by 1 gram of ginger administered two hours after surgery ( 722 , 723 , 13237 , 20336 , 20338 , 103356 , 103360 ). Ginger aromatherapy has also been evaluated for the prevention of PONV. Application of 5% ginger essential oil to the wrists of patients prior to the induction of general anesthesia seems to prevent PONV in approximately 80% of treated patients ( 20334 ). Also, use of ginger essential oil aromatherapy on a gauze pad results in nausea relief in approximately 67% of patients compared with 40% in the placebo group; however, a blend of essential oils including ginger, spearmint, peppermint, and cardamom, results in nausea relief in 82% of patients ( 89888 ).These conflicting findings may be due to differences in outcome measures and the chemical compositions of ginger preparations used in the various clinical studies. Some evidence suggests that the efficacy of ginger for preventing PONV differs based on the formulation used. A network meta-analysis of 18 studies evaluating various ginger preparations, including ginger oil, ginger powder, ginger extract, and a combination of ginger powder and antiemetics, for the prevention of PONV suggests that ginger powder and ginger oil are the most effective formulations for preventing nausea and vomiting, respectively. The analysis also shows that while no ginger formulation is superior to another for the prevention of nausea, ginger powder and ginger oil have a lower risk of postoperative vomiting when compared with ginger extract. A subgroup analysis suggests that ginger seems to be most effective in adults over 30 years of age, when administered preoperatively, and when used for gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, obstetric, or ophthalmic surgeries ( 112108 ). more Postoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for postoperative recovery. One preliminary clinical study in adults who had a tonsillectomy shows that taking a specific ginger supplement (Solgar, Leonia) 500 mg twice daily for 7 days along with acetaminophen and antibiotics modestly improves pain and wound healing when compared with acetaminophen and antibiotics alone ( 96674 ). more Postpartum complications. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial in patients with postpartum pain. A small clinical study in patients recovering from vaginal delivery shows that taking ginger powder 500 mg 8-hours post-delivery, followed by 250 mg every 8 hours thereafter for 24 hours, reduces postpartum pain by nearly 1 point on a 10-point rating scale when compared with placebo ( 107904 ). It is unclear if this improvement would be considered clinically relevant. more Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial in patients with radiation-induced nausea and vomiting. A very small study in adults with cervical cancer undergoing treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy shows that taking ginger 250-500 mg twice daily for 6 weeks in addition to standard antiemetic therapy does not reduce acute or delayed nausea and vomiting when compared with antiemetic therapy alone ( 113616 ). more Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). One small clinical study suggests that oral ginger may improve some symptoms of RA. Preliminary clinical research in adults with RA shows that taking ginger powder 1500 mg daily for 12 weeks improves disease activity on the Disease Activity Score-28 when compared with placebo ( 100697 ). Another small study in adults with RA shows that taking a combination product containing ginger, ashwagandha, black pepper, and colchicum luteum twice daily for 4 weeks does not improve RA disease scores when compared with celecoxib 100 mg orally twice daily ( 114785 ). However, the interpretation of these results is limited by. poor methodology, and the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Smoking cessation. Oral ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults in India with a history of smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily for at least 3 years shows that taking a specific combination product containing ginger 50 mg, ashwagandha, cowhage, turmeric and other herbal extracts (Smotect, Smotect India) twice daily for 3 months reduces the number of cigarettes smoked by approximately 3 per day when compared with placebo. This product also reduces levels of alveolar carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin but does not improve lung capacity ( 112115 ). However, only data from patients who completed treatment were analyzed, which limits the validity of this study. It is also unclear if these effects are due to ginger, other ingredients, or the combination. more Swallowing dysfunction. The effects of oral ginger for treating swallowing dysfunction are inconclusive. Reasons for the conflicting findings may relate to the route of administration or the number of treatments provided. Clinical research shows that applying a spray containing ginger and clematix root (Tongyan) to the oropharynx for 28 days is more effective than placebo at treating grade 2 or 3 dysphagia in stroke victims. However, there does not seem to be a beneficial effect in patients with grade 1 dysphagia ( 20342 ). Other clinical research in elderly patients with dysphagia shows that taking a single dose of ginger 2 mg orally does not improve swallowing but increases saliva ( 96671 ). It is possible that a single dose of ginger is not enough to improve swallowing function. more Toxin-induced liver damage. Oral ginger might help to prevent liver damage in patients using antimycobacterial drugs. Preliminary clinical research shows that a specific ginger supplement (Zintoma, Goldaru) 500 mg taken 30 minutes prior to antimycobacterial drugs daily for 4 weeks reduces the percentage of patients experiencing an increase in liver function enzymes to greater than five times the upper limit of normal by 54% when compared with placebo. Antimycobacterial drugs used for tuberculosis in the study included isoniazid 5 mg/kg, rifampin 10 mg/kg, ethambutol 15 mg/kg, and pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg daily ( 96670 ). more Traumatic brain injury (TBI). Oral ginger has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary research in young adults with subjective memory dysfunction associated with mild TBI, shows that taking a combination of ginger 36 mg and boswellia 360 mg (Memoral) every 8 hours orally for one month improves scores for some, but not all, parameters on an auditory-visual learning test performed at one and three months, when compared with placebo. Total learning scores increased by about 7.5 points with the ginger combination product, compared with 4 points for placebo ( 110132 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to ginger, boswellia, or the combination. more Ulcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for improving symptoms of ulcerative colitis. Preliminary clinical research in adults with ulcerative colitis shows that taking ginger powder 1000 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves disease activity as measured by the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index Questionnaire when compared with taking placebo. However, taking ginger did not improve quality of life, stool frequency, bowel distress, or flatulence when compared with placebo ( 100694 ). It is possible that this study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in these secondary outcomes. more Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Although there has been interest in using oral ginger for various upper respiratory tract infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of ginger for this condition. Vertigo. It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for improving symptoms of vertigo. A small clinical study shows that taking 1 gram of ginger orally as a single dose prior to stimulated vertigo seems to reduce symptoms of vertigo, including nausea, when compared with placebo. However, it does not seem to reduce nystagmus ( 7623 ). more Gastroenteritis-associated nausea and vomiting . It is unclear if oral ginger is beneficial for children with gastroenteritis-associated vomiting. In children aged 1-10 years with acute gastroenteritis-associated vomiting, clinical research shows that taking a single dose of ginger reduces the risk of vomiting at least once in the subsequent 8 hours by 20% when compared with placebo. The incidence of vomiting over the next 24 and 48 hours was also modestly reduced. The children were given 20 drops of ginger equivalent to 10 mg immediately, followed by every 8 hours until cessation of vomiting. All children were offered hypotonic oral rehydration solution (ORS) 30 minutes after the first dose ( 106076 ). The number of children accepting ORS, and the quantity of ORS consumed, was less in the group receiving placebo. It is unclear if this affected the outcomes of this study. Also, the incidence or severity of nausea was not investigated. more More evidence is needed to rate ginger for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Ginger has been safely used in multiple clinical trials ( 721 , 722 , 723 , 5343 , 7048 , 7084 , 7085 , 7400 , 7623 , 11346 )( 12472 , 13080 , 13237 , 13244 , 17369 , 17928 , 17929 , 89889 , 89890 , 89894 )( 89895 , 89898 , 89899 , 90102 , 96252 , 96253 , 96259 , 96260 , 96669 ) ( 101760 , 101761 , 101762 , 103359 , 107903 ). Possibly Safe when used topically and appropriately, short-term ( 89893 , 89897 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when consumed in the amounts typically found in foods. CHILDREN: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Ginger powder has been used with apparent safety at a dose of up to 750 mg daily for 4 days in girls aged 14-18 years ( 96255 ). PREGNANCY: Likely Safe when consumed in the amounts typically found in foods. Ginger is considered a first-line nonpharmacological treatment option for nausea in pregnancy by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) ( 111601 ). However, it should not be used long-term or without medical supervision and close monitoring. PREGNANCY: Possibly Safe when used for medicinal purposes. Despite some early reports of adverse effects ( 721 , 7083 ) and one observational study suggesting that taking dried ginger and other herbal supplements during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy marginally increased the chance of stillbirth ( 96254 ), most research shows that ginger is unlikely to cause harm to the baby. The risk for major malformations in infants of parents who took ginger when pregnant does not appear to be higher than the baseline rate of 1% to 3% ( 721 , 1922 , 5343 , 11346 , 13071 , 13080 , 96254 ). Also, other research suggests that ginger intake during various trimesters does not significantly affect the risk of spontaneous abortion, congenital malformations, stillbirth, perinatal death, preterm birth, low birth weight, or low Apgar scores ( 18211 , 90103 ). Ginger use has been associated with an increase in non-severe vaginal bleeding, including spotting, after week 17 of pregnancy ( 18211 ). LACTATION: Likely Safe when consumed in the amounts typically found in foods. There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of ginger when used for medicinal purposes; avoid amounts greater than those found in foods.",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: Ginger is typically used in doses of 0.5-3 grams daily for up to 12 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Ginger extract is sometimes standardized to gingerols, zingerone, and shogaol content. Concentrations of gingerols have ranged from 4.3% to 5% ( 17933 , 17934 , 101761 , 101762 ). Topical: Ginger has been used in various topical formulations, including as a mouthwash, gel, ointment, and massage oil. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Aromatherapy:Ginger essential oil has been used in aromatherapy. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Children Oral: Ginger has been used in doses of 0.75 to 2 grams daily for 3-4 days. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization & Formulation In clinical trials, ginger has been provided in syrup, biscuits, tablets, capsules, and teas as fresh root, dried root, or liquid extract ( 90103 , 91201 ). An analysis of ten ginger supplements shows that the gingerol composition can range from 0 to 9.43 mg/gram, with 6-shogaol levels ranging from 0.16 to 2.18 mg/gram, 8-gingerol levels ranging from 0.00 to 1.1 mg/gram, and 10-gingerol levels ranging from 0.00 to 1.40 mg/gram ( 51934 ). Various standardized products have been used in clinical trials. In one clinical trial, each ginger capsule contained liquid ginger root extract that was considered equivalent to 250 mg of ginger root (Aphios Corporation) and provided 8.5 mg of combined gingerols, zingerone, and shogaol ( 20316 ). Raw ginger capsules (Hawkins Pharmaceutical Group) have been standardized to contain 4.3% gingerols composed specifically of 6-gingerol 4.1 mg/gram, 8-gingerol 1.3 mg/gram, 10-gingerol 1.9 mg/gram, and 6-shogaol 2.2 mg/gram ( 17933 , 17934 ). Heat-treated ginger capsules have been standardized to contain 6-gingerol 2.8 mg/gram, 8-gingerol 1.0 mg/gram, 10-gingerol 1.6 mg/gram, and 6-shogaol 2.6 mg/gram ( 17933 ). Ginger extract standardized to 5% gingerols has been used ( 101761 , 101762 ). Other ginger capsules used in clinical research have been standardized to contain 2.29 mg/gram of gingerols and 6-shogaols ( 90102 ). A Trikatu extract used as a topical spray in a clinical trial has been standardized to contain extracts of black pepper, long pepper, and ginger, and include 0.074% piperine and 0.046% gingerol ( 89893 ).",

Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Ginger may have antiplatelet effects and may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. However, research is conflicting. Laboratory research suggests that ginger inhibits thromboxane synthetase and decreases platelet aggregation ( 7622 , 12634 , 20321 , 20322 , 20323 , 96257 ). However, this has not been demonstrated unequivocally in humans, with mixed results from clinical trials ( 96257 ).

Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, when taken prior to cyclosporine, ginger might decrease cyclosporine levels. In an animal model, ginger juice taken 2 hours prior to cyclosporine administration reduced the maximum concentration and area under the curve of cyclosporine by 51% and 40%, respectively. This effect was not observed when ginger juice and cyclosporine were administered at the same time ( 20401 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination.

However, this interaction has not been reported in humans. more CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Ginger might increase or decrease the levels of CYP3A4 substrates. In vitro research and some case reports suggest that ginger inhibits CYP3A4 activity ( 111544 , 111644 ). Three case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describe increased toxicity in patients taking ginger and cancer medications that are CYP3A4 substrates (imatinib, dabrafenib, and crizotinib). However, the causality of this interaction is unclear due to the presence of multiple interacting drugs and routes of administration ( 111644 ). Conversely, other in vitro research suggests that ginger induces CYP3A4 activity, leading to reduced levels of CYP3A4 substrates ( 111404 ). However, this interaction has not been reported in humans. more LOSARTAN (Cozaar) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, ginger might increase levels of losartan and the risk of hypotension. In animal research, ginger increased the levels and hypotensive effects of a single dose of losartan ( 102459 ). It is not clear if ginger alters the concentration or effects of losartan when taken continuously. Additionally, this interaction has not been shown in humans. more METRONIDAZOLE (Flagyl) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, ginger might increase levels of metronidazole. In an animal model, ginger increased the absorption and plasma half-life of metronidazole. In addition, the elimination rate and clearance of metronidazole was significantly reduced ( 20350 ). more NIFEDIPINE (Procardia) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Ginger may have antiplatelet effects and increase the risk of bleeding if used with nifedipine. Clinical research shows that combined treatment with ginger 1 gram plus nifedipine 10 mg significantly inhibits platelet aggregation when compared to nifedipine or ginger alone ( 20324 ). more P-GLYCOPROTEIN SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Ginger might increase the absorption and blood levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates. In vitro research and case reports suggest that ginger inhibits drug efflux by P-gp, potentially increasing absorption and serum levels of P-gp substrates ( 111544 , 111644 ). Two case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describe increased toxicity in patients taking ginger and cancer medications that are P-gp substrates (trametinib, crizotinib).

Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Ginger might increase the risk of bleeding with phenprocoumon. Phenprocoumon, a warfarin-related anticoagulant, might increase the international normalized ratio (INR) when taken with ginger. There is one case report of a 76-year-old woman with a stable INR on phenprocoumon that increased to greater than 10 when she began consuming dried ginger and ginger tea ( 12880 ). more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Ginger might increase the risk of bleeding with warfarin. Laboratory research suggests that ginger might inhibit thromboxane synthetase and decrease platelet aggregation ( 7622 , 12634 , 20321 , 20322 , 20323 ). In one case report, ginger increased the INR when taken with phenprocoumon, which has similar pharmacological effects as warfarin ( 12880 ). In another case report, ginger increased the INR when taken with a combination of warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, and acetaminophen ( 20349 ). A longitudinal analysis suggests that taking ginger increases the risk of bleeding in patients taking warfarin for at least 4 months ( 20348 ). However, research in healthy people suggests that ginger has no effect on INR, or the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin ( 12881 , 15176 ). Until more is known, monitor INRs closely in patients taking large amounts of ginger. more",
  "mechanism_text": "General The applicable parts of ginger are the rhizome and root. Active constituents of ginger include gingerol, gingerdione, shogaol, and sesquiterpene and monoterpene volatile oils ( 12632 , 16305 , 51791 , 51836 , 101759 ). The chemical constituents of ginger vary among fresh, semi-dry, and dry forms of ginger ( 12632 ).These constituents seem to have a variety of pharmacological properties including antipyretic, analgesic, antitussive, anti-inflammatory, sedative, antibiotic, weak antifungal, and other properties ( 7628 , 12632 ). However, all of these pharmacological effects may not occur when whole ginger preparations are used. Analgesic effects Ginger is traditionally used for low back and stomach pain. In human research, ginger, with or without feverfew, is effective at reducing pain associated with migraine headaches ( 19357 , 22602 , 89894 , 101761 ). Ginger may also help in the reduction of muscle pain following eccentric exercise ( 17933 ). Analgesic effects of ginger have also been shown in animal pain models ( 20403 ). In animal research, a possible mechanisms of action has been suggested relating to the inhibitory effect of 6-shogaol on the release of substance P ( 51828 ). Substance P is a neuropeptide that is associated with inflammation and pain. Another possible mechanism of action is the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by gingerols and shogaols ( 101761 ). Anthelmintic effects There is preliminary evidence that ginger may have anthelmintic effects ( 7628 ). In animal research, both ginger powder and ginger extract had anthelmintic effects with respective maximum reductions of 25.6% and 66.6% in eggs per gram (EPG) of feces on day 10 of post-treatment in sheep ( 51924 ). Anti-diabetic effects Animal and human evidence suggests that ginger may increase insulin levels and/or decrease blood glucose levels ( 12636 , 20402 , 20403 , 20404 , 20405 , 89895 , 89896 , 107898 ). Also, in laboratory models of diabetes, ginger seems to increase the release of insulin and lower cholesterol levels ( 12636 ). In streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, ginger produced a significant increase in insulin levels and a decrease in fasting glucose levels and also caused a decrease in serum cholesterol, serum triglyceride, and blood pressure ( 12636 , 20402 , 20403 , 20404 , 20405 ). Anti-emetic effects The mechanism of action of ginger's effect on nausea and vomiting remains uncertain. However, there are several proposed mechanisms that have been investigated in laboratory models. The ginger constituents gingerols and shogaols might have antiemetic effects ( 51900 ). Preclinical research has shown that the 6-gingerol constituent can inhibit neurokinin-1, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. This might be one of the mechanisms by which ginger reduces nausea and vomiting ( 1924 , 97539 ). In fact, some clinical research shows that adding 6-gingerol 10 mg twice daily to standard antiemetic therapy with ondansetron, metoclopramide, and dexamethasone seems to reduce the need for rescue therapy and reduce both acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced vomiting compared to standard antiemetic therapy alone in cancer patients located in Asia and receiving mostly highly emetogenic chemotherapy ( 97539 ). Some researchers have suggested that ginger might work by increasing gastrointestinal (GI) motility ( 1923 , 52001 , 52150 ). However, some evidence shows that ginger does not influence GI emptying time ( 7621 , 7624 ). Other ginger constituents such as 6-shogaol and galanolactone seem to act on serotonin and muscarinic receptors in the GI tract ( 1924 , 18211 , 52049 , 52187 ). Galanolactone seems to act primarily on 5-HT3 receptors in the ileum, which are the same receptors affected by some prescription antiemetics such as ondansetron (Zofran). The gingerols and shogaols from ginger all appear to have 5-HT3 receptor antagonistic effects ( 51900 , 51917 , 52049 ). The predominant antiemetic action of ginger is localized in the GI tract, but there is some evidence that ginger constituents may also have central nervous system (CNS) activity ( 1924 , 18211 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Ginger is sometimes used for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anti-inflammatory effects of ginger have been shown in various animal models ( 20403 , 52035 ). Researchers speculate that certain constituents of ginger inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase pathways, and leukotrienes, as shown in laboratory research ( 7401 , 18210 , 51859 , 51868 ). In human and laboratory research, ginger inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines ( 12473 , 51887 , 52031 , 52035 , 89886 , 103355 , 107899 ), possibly via inhibition of the NF kappa B pathway ( 52038 , 52043 , 52053 , 100697 ) and stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) ( 52053 ). It also seems to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2), which mediate inflammation ( 12634 , 51932 , 52031 ). PGE2 levels decreased in human colonic mucosa following intake of ginger root extract ( 52091 ). The effect of ginger on the NF kappa B pathway also appears to attenuate the production of nitric oxide synthase in laboratory research ( 51933 ). Anti-platelet effects Laboratory research shows that ginger inhibits platelet aggregation. However, this has not been demonstrated unequivocally in humans ( 96257 ). In human research, taking ginger 5 grams with a fatty meal inhibited platelet aggregation ( 52126 ). However, taking a lower dose of 2 grams did not reduce platelet aggregation in the absence of a high fat meal ( 52128 ). The antiplatelet effect of ginger is thought to be exerted by the ability of some of its constituents to inhibit platelet thromboxane ( 7622 , 12634 , 52105 , 52120 ). However, in human research ginger did not inhibit thromboxane production ( 52139 ). Antibacterial effects It is possible that ginger may be beneficial for bacterial infections. Laboratory research suggests ginger extract, ginger essential oils, and ginger constituents have antibacterial effects against a range of organisms, such as Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes ( 51821 , 51912 , 52021 ). In vitro, ginger extract inhibited the growth of Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni, bacteria that play a role in gastrointestinal symptoms ( 39783 , 49487 ). Antifungal effects Ginger exerted antifungal effects against a wide range of fungi, including drug-resistant strains, via its constituents, 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerols and 6-gingerdiol ( 51824 , 51836 ). However, other studies reported low efficacy of ginger essential oils against various fungi ( 52026 ). Antioxidant effects The antioxidant effects of ginger may explain some of its clinical effects. Ginger and its constituents, including 6-, 8-, and 10-gingerol, and 6-shogaol, have demonstrated antioxidant effects such as increasing glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in various forms of research, including in vitro, animal, and clinical research ( 4067 , 40694 , 51827 , 51843 , 51891 , 51906 , 51915 , 51959 , 51976 , 51990 )( 52064 , 52066 , 52069 , 105059 , 107900 ). Blood pressure effects There is interest in using ginger to lower blood pressure. Animal research shows that fresh ginger extract blocks calcium channels, stimulates muscarinic receptors, and has negative inotropic and chronotropic effects ( 12633 , 51905 ). However, preliminary clinical research in patients with diabetes shows that drinking black tea containing 3 grams of ginger three times daily for 8 weeks does not affect endothelial function nor reduce blood pressure by a clinically significant amount when compared with placebo ( 96669 ). Other preliminary clinical research in healthy adult females shows that taking ginger extract 600 mg orally daily for 3 months also does not lower blood pressure when compared with placebo ( 109520 ). Cognitive effects Ginger might increase levels of dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine in the brain cortex and hippocampus, which could improve cognitive function ( 110132 ). Gastrointestinal effects There is interest in using oral ginger for modulation of the fecal microbiome. A small clinical study in adults with colorectal adenoma shows that taking ginger 500 mg orally for 6 weeks does not improve fecal microbial diversity when compared with placebo ( 113771 ). Gastroprotective effects Ginger is traditionally used for stomach and gastrointestinal ailments. Also, gastroprotective effects of ginger have been shown in various animal models ( 52099 ). Preliminary research suggests gastroprotective effects of ginger might be due to increases in levels of protective prostaglandins in the gut wall ( 18210 ). In an animal model of ulcerative colitis, ginger extract improved levels of inflammatory cytokines and improved antioxidant effects, suggesting these pathways may play a role ( 52007 ). Animal research suggests the constituents zingiberene and 6-gingerol may be the important constituents ( 52107 ). The constituent 6-gingerol inhibited the formation of HCl-induced gastric lesions, possibly through an interaction with the vanilloid-receptor ( 51863 ). Some constituents of ginger have been shown to affect intestinal motility in animal models. For example, 6-shogaol when given orally enhanced gastrointestinal motility ( 51908 , 52096 ) and ginger extract prevented a delay in gastric emptying ( 51811 ). In patients with functional dyspepsia, a single dose of ginger also increased gastric emptying ( 20325 ). Immunomodulating effects Preliminary clinical research in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) shows that ginger increases FoxP3 gene expression. This allows for proper development of regulatory T cells, which help suppress the autoimmune response of effector T cells. Ginger also appears to decrease the expression of the ROR gamma t and T-bet genes, both of which are believed to be involved in the autoimmune process ( 100697 ). Insecticidal effects In human research, a topical application of Trikatu, which contains ginger, long pepper, and black pepper extracts does not reduce the papule size associated with mosquito bites ( 89893 ). However, ginger is traditionally used for its insecticidal effects. Ginger has demonstrated both larvicidal and repellent activity against various types of mosquitoes ( 51996 , 52024 ). Also, its essential oils have demonstrated ovicidal activity against mosquito species ( 31384 ), which may be attributed to 4-gingerol ( 52009 ). Lipid-lowering effects Clinical evidence suggests that taking ginger reduces triglyceride and cholesterol levels in patients with hyperlipidemia ( 20327 ). Similar effects have been shown in animal research ( 12634 , 51916 , 52147 ). Other studies failed to demonstrate any lipid-lowering effects of ginger ( 46881 ). In an animal model of hyperlipidemia, ginger decreased the endothelium intima-media thickness ( 51952 ). Musculoskeletal effects There is interest in using ginger to treat various musculoskeletal conditions. Preliminary clinical research in generally healthy adults with self-reported shoulder stiffness shows that taking ginger extract 100 mg orally daily for 8 weeks does not improve stiffness scores when compared with placebo ( 114782 ). Mutagenic effects There is very preliminary evidence that some extracts and constituents of ginger might have mutagenic properties. However, these constituents may only be mutagenic when in the presence of other mutagens. Whole ginger preparations may not have mutagenic effects. Also, other ginger constituents such as zingerone have the opposite effect and are antimutagenic ( 11299 ). Ginger constituents 6-shogaol and 6-gingerol have also demonstrated antimutagenic effects. Preliminary research shows that shogaol and 6-gingerol increased apoptosis of head and neck cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner ( 97540 ). Ophthalmic effects There is interest in using ginger to treat various ophthalmic conditions. Preliminary clinical research in generally healthy adults with self-reported eye fatigue shows that taking ginger extract 100 mg orally daily for 8 weeks modestly improves fatigue scores, but not ocular blood flow, when compared with placebo ( 114782 ). Respiratory effects Ginger is traditionally used in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections, cough, respiratory distress, and bronchitis. Ginger does not appear to benefit respiratory function in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ( 89702 ). However, administration via nasogastric tubing improves symptoms in adults with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) ( 20343 , 89886 ). Mechanisms of action are unclear. However, in laboratory research, ginger inhibits airway contraction and associated Ca(2+) signaling, possibly via blockade of plasma membrane Ca(2+) channels ( 52002 ). In a mouse model of Th2-mediated pulmonary inflammation, ginger aqueous extract, administered intraperitoneally prior to airway challenge, resulted in a marked decrease in the recruitment of eosinophils to the lungs ( 52015 ). Sex hormone effects Ginger inhibits thromboxane synthetase. This could affect testosterone receptor binding in the fetus and theoretically affect sex steroid differentiation of the fetal brain ( 7083 ). However, this has not been seen in animals or humans. In animal research, ginger extract increased testosterone levels and the weight of the testis ( 51822 ). Teratogenic effects Animal research hasn't shown any evidence of teratogenicity ( 11297 , 11298 ). However, one study did find evidence of embryo mortality ( 11298 ). Weight loss effects There is interest in using ginger for weight loss. Mechanisms of action have been explored in animal models using ginger constituents and ginger extracts. Azingerone reduced body weight and adipose tissue weight in ovariectomized rats, an effect that may be a result of an increase in norepinephrine-induced lipolysis in adipocytes ( 52012 ). In vitro, ginger, possibly via one of the gingerols, enhanced adipocyte differentiation ( 51880 ). However, clinical research in non-obese adults shows that ginger does not affect postprandial energy expenditure, resting energy expenditure, respiratory quotient, or levels of hormones involved in satiety when compared with placebo, although self-reported feelings of satiety were reduced ( 52095 , 109520 ). Preliminary clinical research in overweight individuals is conflicting and shows ginger may reduce body weight and body fat when used as part of a specific diet and exercise program, but not when used alone ( 20346 , 20347 , 40802 , 109520 ).",
