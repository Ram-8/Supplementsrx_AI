  "overview_text": "The gymnema plant is a climbing plant, with small yellow flowers. It is found in tropical and subtropical regions in India, as well as other parts of Asia, Africa, and Australia. Gymnema has traditionally been used in Ayurvedic medicine for various purposes, including respiratory conditions, heart and liver health, constipation, amenorrhea, eye health, and snakebite.",
  "effectiveness_text": "Expand All | Collapse All Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Diabetes. It is unclear if oral gymnema is beneficial for diabetes. A meta-analysis of 10 small clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking gymnema modestly reduces fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels, and also seems to reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), when compared to baseline. Gymnema may also modestly reduce total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. ( 110022 ). Another meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies, that includes some of the same studies, also shows that taking gymnema modestly reduces fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when compared with diet or placebo. However, this analysis shows that gymnema does not improve HbA1c, oral glucose tolerance, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( 112184 ). The validity of these analyses is limited by the inclusion of mostly low-quality studies that enrolled heterogeneous patient populations and employed varying gymnema dosing regimens of 0.4-10 grams daily, sometimes in conjunction with antidiabetes medications. In addition, many of the included studies were non-randomized and lacked a comparator group. more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral gymnema is beneficial for impaired glucose tolerance. One small clinical study in overweight or obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking gymnema (Swanson Superior Herbs) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve glucose control, lipid profile, anthropometric indices, or blood pressure when compared with placebo ( 105346 ). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral gymnema is beneficial for metabolic syndrome. One small clinical study shows that taking gymnema leaf (Swanson Premium G. sylvestre leaf, Swanson Health Products) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces body weight by 4% and body mass index (BMI) by 2% when compared to baseline in overweight adults with metabolic syndrome. However, it is unclear if these changes are significant when compared with placebo. In addition, gymnema does not appear to improve blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, or blood lipid levels when compared with placebo ( 96235 ). more Obesity. It is unclear if oral gymnema improves weight loss in overweight or obese adults. One small clinical study shows that taking gymnema leaf (Swanson Premium G. sylvestre leaf, Swanson Health Products) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces body weight and body mass index (BMI) when compared to baseline in overweight adults with metabolic syndrome. However, it is unclear if these changes are significant when compared with placebo ( 96235 ). Another small clinical study by the same authors evaluating overweight adults with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking gymnema (Swanson Superior Herbs) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight or BMI when compared with placebo ( 105346 ). Gymnema has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. One small clinical study shows that taking a combination of gymnema extract 400 mg, hydroxycitric acid 2800 mg, and niacin-bound chromium 4 mg orally daily for 8 weeks decreases BMI and body weight when compared to baseline in overweight and obese adults. This product provided 400 mcg of elemental chromium and 100 mg of gymnemic acids ( 42604 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to gymnema, other ingredients, or the combination. more More evidence is needed to rate gymnema for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately. Gymnema leaf extract has been used safely in doses of 200 mg twice daily for up to 20 months or 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks ( 45 , 46 , 42604 , 105346 ). PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Standardization & Formulation Gymnema leaf extract is sometimes standardized to gymnemic acid content. Gymnema leaf extract used in clinical research has contained up to 25% gymnemic acid ( 42604 ). A specific gymnema leaf extract (GS4, Sabinsa Corporation) is prepared by extraction of gymnema leaves in 95% ethanol, followed by precipitation using acid ( 46 , 54563 , 54568 ).",

Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, taking gymnema with antidiabetes drugs might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Gymnema reduces blood glucose levels in some human and animal research. In human studies, it has been shown to enhance the blood glucose lowering effects of hypoglycemic drugs ( 45 , 46 , 92119 , 92121 , 92123 ). However, other research in adults with prediabetes or metabolic syndrome suggests that gymnema does not reduce fasting levels of blood glucose ( 96235 , 105346 ). Until more is known, monitor blood glucose levels closely. more CYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, gymnema might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2. Animal and in vitro research shows that gymnema can inhibit the CYP1A2 enzyme ( 96236 , 96237 , 96238 ). In one animal study, oral administration of gymnema for 7 days increased the plasma concentrations of phenacetin, a CYP1A2 substrate, by about 1.4-fold and reduced the clearance of phenacetin by about 29% ( 96237 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, gymnema might increase or decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C9. Animal research shows that gymnema can induce the CYP2C9 enzyme. In one animal study, gymnema caused a 2.4-fold increase in the clearance of tolbutamide, a CYP2C9 substrate, in rats ( 96237 ). In vitro research also shows that gymnema can inhibit CYP2C9 ( 96236 , 96238 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, gymnema might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. One in vitro study using rat liver microsomes shows that gymnema can modestly inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme ( 96238 ). However, other in vitro research using human liver microsomes shows that gymnema does not affect CYP3A4 activity ( 96236 ). Animal research also shows that gymnema does not alter the function of CYP3A4. In one study in rats, oral administration of gymnema for 7 days did not alter the clearance of amlodipine, a CYP3A4 substrate ( 96237 ). more PHENACETIN Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, taking gymnema with phenacetin might increase the levels of phenacetin. Animal research shows that gymnema, administered orally for 7 days, decreases the clearance of phenacetin in a dose-dependent manner by about 21% to 29% and increases plasma levels about 1.3- to 1.4-fold when compared to control ( 96237 , 96238 ). more TOLBUTAMIDE (Orinase) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, taking gymnema with tolbutamide might the decrease levels of tolbutamide. Animal research shows that gymnema, administered orally for 7 days, increases the clearance of tolbutamide by 2.4-fold when compared to control ( 96237 ). more",
  "mechanism_text": "General The applicable parts of gymnema are the leaves and roots ( 92121 ). The leaves contain oleanane and dammarane triterpene saponins. These are the primary constituents responsible for gymnema's effects ( 92120 , 92121 ). Oleanane triterpenes include gymnemic acids and gymnemasaponins. Dammarane triterpenes include gymnemasides ( 54561 , 54582 , 95005 ). The largest amount of gymnemic acid is found in the shoot tips. Anthraquinones, flavonoids, tartaric acid, formic acid, butyric acid, gumarin, gymnemagenol, gymnemanol, gymmestrogenin quercitol, stigmasterol, alkaloids, and beta-amyrin related glycosides are also found in gymnema ( 12549 , 54561 , 54581 , 92121 , 92122 , 92123 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Animal research shows that gymnema leaf extract has anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-inflammatory effects of gymnema extract are attributed to saponin, tannin, and steroid constituents ( 92121 ). Antimicrobial effects In vitro research shows that gymnema extract has antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus but not E. coli and Proteus vulgaris ( 14861 , 92121 ). Hypoglycemic effects Gymnema extracts lower blood glucose in animal models and humans with diabetes ( 45 , 46 ). However, fasting levels of blood glucose are not reduced in patients with impaired glucose tolerance or metabolic syndrome ( 96235 , 105346 ). Gymnemic acids seem to reduce intestinal absorption of glucose and may stimulate pancreatic beta-cell growth ( 47 , 48 , 11367 ). Other research suggests that constituents of gymnema have a direct effect on beta-cell function, increasing the release of insulin ( 12549 ). Gymnema can increase serum C-peptide levels, suggesting an increase in endogenous insulin secretion ( 45 ). Immunomodulatory effects Laboratory research shows that a methanolic extract of gymnema can stimulate nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) from peritoneal macrophages, in a concentration dependent manner. A lower concentration of extract appears to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation, while a higher concentration is needed for production of ROS and NO. Gymnemic acid also appears to stimulate splenic T and B cell proliferation. Higher immunomodulatory activity was seen when the extract was combined with other immunostimulatory substances, such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) ( 92120 ). Lipid effects Gymnema leaf extract has been shown to lower serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in animal models of hyperlipidemia ( 54578 , 54579 , 92119 ). However, these effects have not been shown in human research ( 105346 ). Some animal research shows that gymnemic acid, a constituent of gymnema leaf extract, can inhibit the intestinal absorption of the fatty acid oleic acid; this may be one mechanism by which gymnema lowers cholesterol ( 54580 ). Other animal research shows that gymnemic acids may reduce cholesterol levels by increasing fecal cholesterol excretion ( 94670 ). In animal models of metabolic syndrome, gymnema seems to decrease weight gain and triglycerides but does not affect serum cholesterol ( 14859 ). Taste effects Gymnemic acid and gurmarin, constituents of gymnema, inhibit the ability to taste bitter (quinine) or sweet (sugar) flavors, without affecting the ability to taste sour, astringent, or pungent flavors ( 11292 , 92121 ). Two clinical studies show that taking a mint tablet containing gymnemic acids reduces the consumption of sweet foods (i.e., chocolate bars) when compared with placebo; this effect is theoretically due to a reduced desire for the chocolate due to change in taste, not a change in appetite (105347,112183 ).",
