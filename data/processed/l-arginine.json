  "overview_text": "L-arginine is an amino acid necessary for protein synthesis. It is found naturally in foods such as red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products. L-arginine was first isolated in 1886 by the Swiss chemist Ernst Schultz from the extract of a lupin seedling.",
  "effectiveness_text": "Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Angina. Oral L-arginine seems to improve symptoms and exercise tolerance in patients with angina. Clinical research shows that taking L-arginine orally seems to decrease symptoms and improve exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with mild to severe angina ( 3593 , 7815 , 7816 , 31866 , 31923 ). Some patients with severe angina who have frequent attacks at rest despite treatment with standard antianginal agents might also benefit from L-arginine ( 3593 ). However, L-arginine does not seem to improve objective measures of blood vessel dilation or increase circulating concentrations of nitric oxide ( 7817 , 99262 ). Also, when used in combination with ten 200 mcg injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-165 plasmid DNA, L-arginine 6 grams daily orally for 3 months does not improve angina severity in patients with coronary artery disease who underwent surgical angiogenesis compared to patients who did not receive this combination ( 32001 ). In addition, intravenous infusion of arginine 10% solution does not improve exercise capacity in patients with stable angina when compared with placebo ( 31843 , 32293 ). more Erectile dysfunction (ED). Oral L-arginine might improve symptoms of ED. When taken with phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, L-arginine seems to provide a small additional benefit. Taking L-arginine orally in high doses, 5 grams daily, improves subjective assessment of sexual function in males with organic ED when compared with placebo ( 222 , 102586 ). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 4 small clinical studies in patients with ED, including those with diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease risk factors, shows that although PDE5 inhibitors improve sexual function better than L-arginine, the combination of PDE5 inhibitors and L-arginine may be more effective than either treatment alone ( 105065 ). In most clinical trials, doses of L-arginine 2.5-5 mg daily for 6-12 weeks were used alone or in addition to PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil 50 mg or tadalafil 5-10 mg daily ( 102586 , 102587 , 102592 , 104222 ). Higher doses have also been investigated. One clinical trial shows that taking L-arginine (Bioarginina, Farmaceutici Damor S.p.A., Napoli, Italy), 2 grams three times daily for 3 months improves sexual function compared with placebo ( 110387 ). However, taking lower doses, 1.5 grams daily, might not be effective in patients with mixed-type ED ( 2038 ). L-arginine has also been examined in combination with other ingredients. A meta-analysis of 2 small clinical studies in males with mild-to-moderate ED shows that taking L- arginine, up to 3 grams daily, in combination with maritime pine for 1-6 months improves a subjective assessment of sexual function when compared with control ( 112715 ). Some preliminary clinical evidence suggests that taking L-arginine orally in low doses, 1.7 grams daily in combination with maritime pine bark extract (Pycnogenol) or taking 0.69 grams daily along with maritime pine bark extract and aspartic acid (Edicare, Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) modestly improves symptoms of ED ( 10416 , 50924 ). Another preliminary clinical trial has investigated the effects of a combination of L-arginine 2.5 grams daily for 6 months and tadalafil 5 mg daily for 3 months, both starting with the initiation of weekly extracorporeal shock wave (ESW) therapy. When compared with ESW alone, this combination modestly improves sexual function for up to 12 months ( 110388 ). The effect of L-arginine alone is not clear from these studies. more Hypertension. Oral L-arginine can modestly reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Oral L-arginine seems to have additive vasodilating effects when used with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or nitrate vasodilators such as isosorbide mononitrate ( 7822 , 20192 , 31916 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research in a variety of populations shows that taking L-arginine reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP; DPB) by an average of 6.40 mmHg and 2.64 mmHg, respectively. Sub-analyses show that these reductions occur in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals. Beneficial effects were limited to adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 19.9 kg/m 2 ( 110384 ). The effect of L-arginine on blood pressure levels in adults exposed to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) has also been investigated. Clinical research in adults with hypertension shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams three times daily for 2 weeks modestly reduces SBP and DBP elevations following a 2-hour exposure to TRAP during an outdoor walk compared with taking placebo ( 110383 ). Doses have included 4-24 grams daily, with the best evidence of benefit for doses of less than 9 grams daily, for 2-24 weeks ( 7818 , 10636 , 31871 , 31923 , 32167 , 32201 , 110383 , 110384 ). more Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Oral L-arginine may help prevent NEC in premature infants. In a meta-analysis of 3 clinical trials, L-arginine 260 mg/kg orally in a single dose or two divided doses daily reduces the absolute risk of NEC in premature infants by about 62% when compared with placebo. To prevent one case of NEC, 6 infants would need to be treated with L-arginine ( 8474 , 91194 , 96803 ). more Peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Short-term use of intravenous or oral L-arginine may improve symptoms of PAD, but long-term use does not seem to be beneficial. Clinical research shows that using L-arginine intravenously or orally for up to 8 weeks increases flow-mediated dilation and improves symptoms of intermittent claudication associated with PAD ( 3465 , 31857 , 31905 ). However, long-term administration of L-arginine orally for up to 6 months does not improve walking speed, walking distance, or absolute claudication distance in patients with PAD and intermittent claudication ( 31957 , 31985 ). more Pre-eclampsia. Intravenous L-arginine may have beneficial effects in pre-eclampsia. However, it is unclear if oral L-arginine is effective. One small clinical study shows that intravenous L-arginine 30 grams as a one-time dose decreases systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 11 mmHg when compared to baseline in pregnant patients with hypertension or pre-eclampsia ( 31847 ), while intravenous L-arginine 20 grams daily for 5 days decreases SBP and DBP by about 2% when compared with placebo ( 31978 ). Another small clinical study shows that oral use of L-arginine 3 grams daily for 3 weeks reduces SBP and DBP by around 7 and 5 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 31938 ); however, taking L-arginine 12 grams daily by mouth for 5 days does not seem to improve blood pressure in these patients ( 11828 ). Another preliminary clinical trial allowing for both oral and intravenous dosing shows that taking L-arginine 3.5 grams by mouth every 6 hours or 10 grams via intravenous infusion every 8 hours shortly before or immediately after delivery and continuing until postpartum day 3 does not improve blood pressure when compared with placebo ( 31959 ). The reasons for the disparate findings are unclear, but the small study sizes, as well as variations in the dose, duration, and timing of therapy before and/or after delivery, may explain some of the differences. Oral L-arginine has also been evaluated for the prevention of pre-eclampsia. One clinical study in patients at high risk for pre-eclampsia shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams daily starting the 20th week of gestation reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia by about 74% when compared with placebo ( 96811 ). Based on these results, one case of pre-eclampsia is prevented for every 6 high-risk pregnant patients treated with L-arginine 3 grams daily. Another clinical study also shows that taking two bars of a specific medical food (Heart Bars, Nellson Nutraceutical) containing L-arginine 6.6 grams and antioxidant vitamins daily starting at 14-32 weeks gestation and continuing until delivery reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia by 44% when compared with a bar containing antioxidant vitamins alone in patients at high risk of pre-eclampsia ( 91197 ). Based on these results, one case of pre-eclampsia is prevented for every 11 high risk patients treated with this L-arginine-containing medical food. more Pregnancy-induced hypertension. Intravenous L-arginine may have beneficial effects in pregnancy-induced hypertension. Some clinical research in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension shows that intravenous infusion of L-arginine 20 grams daily for up to 5 days decreases systolic blood pressure by 2% to 3% and diastolic blood pressure by about 3% when compared with placebo ( 31933 , 31961 , 31978 ). Clinical research in patients with pre-existing hypertension has also been conducted. One clinical trial shows that taking L-arginine 4 grams by mouth daily for 10-12 weeks does not seem to reduce blood pressure in those with pre-existing hypertension or mild gestational hypertension. However, these results are confounded by the fact that more patients taking placebo needed to be placed on antihypertensive therapy during the study. L-arginine reduced the risk of being placed on antihypertensive drug therapy during the pregnancy by 47% when compared with placebo ( 32191 ). Based on this study, for every 5 patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension treated with L-arginine over placebo, antihypertensive drug therapy is avoided in one additional patient. L-arginine has also been investigated in combination with other ingredients in patients with pre-existing hypertension. Preliminary clinical research in patients with pre-existing hypertension and a previous history of pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), or other placenta vascular disorder shows that taking L-arginine and other ingredients starting at 14 weeks gestation prevents an increase in blood pressure and reduces the percentage of patients requiring new antihypertensive medication by about 73% compared with 24.5% of those not taking this combination. In this study, L-arginine 3 grams daily was taken with magnesium 350 mg and salicylate 100 mg. Therefore, the effect of L-arginine alone is unclear. All patients in the study were taking low dose aspirin 100 mg daily ( 110382 ). more Possibly Ineffective Chronic kidney disease (CKD). Oral or intravenous L-arginine does not seem to improve CKD. Most preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine, either orally for up to 6 months or intravenously short-term, does not improve kidney function, glomerular filtration rate, or renal plasma flow in patients with CKD, although proteinuria may be reduced in some patients ( 31844 , 31904 , 32235 , 32303 ). more Hypercholesterolemia. Oral L-arginine does not seem to reduce cholesterol levels. Preliminary clinical research in patients with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking L-arginine 21 grams daily for 4 weeks does not reduce plasma lipids ( 1363 ). Furthermore, meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking L-arginine for up to about 6 months does not reduce total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in populations of healthy individuals or those with cardiovascular disease risk factors. However, there was a very small effect on fasting triglyceride levels ( 102590 , 102591 ). more Myocardial infarction (MI). Oral L-arginine does not seem to improve outcomes after MI. Patients who have had an ST-segment MI who take L-arginine within 24 hours to 21 days, titrated up to a dose of 3 grams three times a day for up to 6 months, do not seem to have reduced vascular stiffness or increased ejection fraction ( 13221 , 32137 ). Also, there is some concern that long-term use of L-arginine might actually worsen outcomes and increase mortality in these patients ( 13221 ). Population studies also suggest that intake of L-arginine does not reduce the risk of experiencing an acute coronary event such as MI or coronary heart disease-related mortality ( 3332 , 6896 , 7821 , 10637 ). more Tuberculosis. Oral L-arginine does not seem to improve symptoms or the clearance of tuberculosis infection. Clinical research shows that taking L-arginine (ArgimaxH) 6 grams daily orally for 8 weeks, with or without vitamin D, does not improve symptoms of tuberculosis or the clearance of tuberculosis infection when used with standard treatment ( 91196 ). more Wound healing. Oral L-arginine does not seem to improve wound healing. Clinical research shows that taking L-arginine (as arginine aspartate) 17 grams orally in three divided doses daily for 2 weeks does not improve epithelialization in healthy, elderly patients with catheter wounds, although it may improve collagen deposition ( 32247 ). Also, taking L-arginine (as L-arginine hydrochloride) 26 grams daily for 5 days perioperatively does not improve angiogenesis, re-epithelialization, or neutrophil count in patients undergoing skin graft donation when compared with placebo ( 20692 ). In addition, taking a wound-specific oral nutrition supplement containing L-arginine 4.5 grams, zinc, and vitamin C twice daily for 4 weeks, along with standard wound care for 8 weeks, is no more effective for wound healing than a standard oral nutrition supplement along with standard wound care ( 90198 ). L-arginine has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. Taking L-arginine enterally or orally, before or after surgery, in combination with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and either eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or fish oil, seems to improve wound healing when compared with a control group ( 5531 , 32174 ). Another observational study conducted in Italy in newborns shows that applying a specific topical powder containing L-arginine, arnica extract, zinc oxide, and other ingredients (Cicaben, Orsana Italia S.r.l.) to the newborn's umbilical cord stump 3 to 4 times daily until stump detachment reduces the rates of mild complications 48 hours after discharge such as a wet cord stump but does not change the time to cord stump detachment or the rates of purulent secretions or umbilical granulomas when compared with standard dry care. However, no differences were noted between the groups one week after discharge ( 113662 ). The validity of these results is limited by the observational nature of the study and the ability of the parents to select a treatment group. It is unclear if the effects in these studies are due to L-arginine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may prevent ARDS. A meta-analysis of three small studies shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams daily, starting in the second or third trimester usually until delivery, reduces the risk of ARDS in the infant by about 54% when compared to control, including placebo or no treatment ( 110379 ). more Altitude sickness. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with altitude sickness. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 4 grams orally three times daily for 2 days while ascending to a high altitude and for 24 hours while at high altitude does not reduce altitude sickness when compared with placebo ( 31955 ). more Anemia of chronic disease. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. One very small clinical study in elderly adults with chronic kidney disease and anemia shows that taking L-arginine orally 1.3 grams daily might increase hemoglobin and erythropoietin levels in some patients when compared to baseline ( 31988 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study size and the lack of a comparator group. more Anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Although there is interest in using oral L-arginine for anthracycline cardiotoxicity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for this purpose. Asthma. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with asthma. Preliminary clinical research in adults with severe asthma shows that taking L-arginine 0.05 gram/kg ideal body weight twice daily does not reduce asthma exacerbations when compared with placebo ( 104223 ). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in exacerbation rates between groups. While other studies have shown adverse airway effects in patients with asthma ( 121 , 31849 ), this study demonstrated no change in exacerbations and reported no adverse airway effects. more Athletic performance. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may improve measures of athletic performance. A meta-analysis of 5 small clinical trials shows that taking L-arginine seems to modestly improve measures of cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by a 0.07 L/minute increase in maximal oxygen uptake, when compared with control ( 105064 ). L-arginine has also been examined for its effects on athletic performance. Most research suggests that taking L-arginine does not improve athletic performance. However, clinical trials are small and may not be adequately powered to detect a difference in these outcomes Taking L-arginine as a single dose of 5 or 6 grams or as 5-10 grams daily for 2-4 weeks does not improve grip strength, strength during resistance exercise, power output during cycling, or muscle function during recovery from intense resistance exercise in healthy adults ( 91190 , 97393 , 99265 , 110381 , 110389 ). Also, taking L-arginine 5 grams daily for 4 weeks (Bioarginina Farmaceutici Damor) or 8 grams daily for 8 days does not increase swim speed ( 110381 , 110386 ). In contrast, some research suggests that drinking a single beverage containing the same dose of L-arginine 6 grams increases the time to exhaustion during high-intensity exercise when compared with placebo ( 32180 ). Also, a meta-analysis of small clinical trials shows that supplementation with L-arginine has a large beneficial effect on aerobic performance and a small beneficial effect on anaerobic performance. However, publication bias was evident in the aerobic performance data, limiting these conclusions. Doses found to be beneficial in this analysis included an acute dose of L-arginine 0.15 gram/kg 60-90 minutes before performance or chronic dosing of 1.5 grams to 2 grams daily for 4-7 weeks for aerobic performance. The chronic dose of L-arginine most likely to be beneficial for anaerobic performance is unclear from this analysis due to inclusion of studies using arginine alpha-ketoglutarate ( 110395 ). With the exception of a few studies which include a very small number of healthy females ( 99265 , 110395 , 110386 ), research on the use of L-arginine for athletic performance has focused almost exclusively on healthy males. Also, studies are heterogeneous with respect to sport and endpoints. Therefore, whether results can be applied to females or specific athletes is unclear. L-arginine has also been evaluated in overweight males. One small clinical study shows that taking a single dose of L-arginine 6 grams 90 minutes prior to high-intensity interval training seems to improve exercise tolerance by improving ventilation, heart rate, and oxygen uptake when compared with placebo ( 105060 ). L-arginine has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Research in male soccer players shows that taking L-arginine 1.2 grams and L-citrulline 1.2 grams daily for 7 days increases total power output over a 10-minute cycling test and improves subjective perceptions of exertion when compared with placebo ( 100956 ). Another study shows that taking L-arginine 1.5 or 3 grams daily, in combination with grape seed extract, increases physical working capacity at fatigue threshold when compared with pretreatment in untrained, college-aged males ( 32164 ). Additionally, a study in trained athletes shows that taking L-arginine 6 grams, in combination with nitrate obtained from fresh spinach, 3 hours prior to exercise improves peak power, average power, and agility when compared with placebo ( 116207 ). It is unclear if these benefits are due to L-arginine, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Beta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in children with beta-thalassemia. Preliminary clinical research in children aged 6-18 years treated conventionally for pulmonary hypertension related to beta-thalassemia shows that taking L-arginine 0.1 mg/kg daily for 60 days reduces Doppler echocardiography pulmonary arterial pressure by 35% compared with baseline. This measurement was increased by up to 15% in children given conventional treatments only; however, a statistical comparison between these treatment groups was lacking ( 110391 ). more Breast cancer. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with breast cancer. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 30 grams daily for 3 days prior to chemotherapy does not improve the clinical response rate in breast cancer patients when compared with placebo ( 32282 ). more Cognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with cognitive impairment. A small clinical trial in frail adults aged 65 years of age and up with hypertension shows that taking L-arginine (Bioarginina) 1.66 grams twice daily for 4 weeks modestly improves cognitive function when compared to placebo ( 110385 ). more Congestive heart failure (CHF). It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with CHF. One small clinical study in patients with CHF stage 2-3 shows that taking L-arginine 15 grams daily for 5 days, in combination with conventional treatment, seems to improve glomerular filtration rate (GFR), creatinine clearance, and sodium and water elimination after saline loading, indicating an improvement in kidney function ( 3596 ). more Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for preventing complications after CABG surgery. Preliminary clinical research shows that venous infusion of L-arginine hydrochloride 30 grams as a 10% solution over 15 minutes helps maintain mean arterial pressure, coronary vascular resistance, and graft blood flow when compared with a placebo infusion in patients that have undergone CABG ( 31840 ). Administering L-arginine 7.5 grams in 500 mL of cardioplegic solution also seems to reduce wedge pressure and intensive care unit stay in patients undergoing CABG; however, it does not reduce hospital stay duration or postoperative complications when compared with cardioplegic solution alone ( 31958 , 31886 ). more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. A small clinical trial in patients with severe COVID-19 shows that receiving oral L-arginine (Argin, Nutrigrow, India) 3 grams daily for a maximum of 10 days while on oxygen support does not affect the percentage of patients weaned off oxygen support after 10 days, the length of time requiring oxygen support, the duration of hospitalization, or the incidence of adverse thrombotic events, compared with placebo ( 110392 ). This study may not have been adequately powered to detect differences between groups. An interim analysis of a small clinical trial in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 shows that adding oral L-arginine (Bioarginina, Farmaceutici Damor) 1.66 grams twice daily to standard therapy throughout hospitalization increases the rate of respiratory support reduction by 60% after 10 days of therapy, but not after 20 days of therapy, when compared with placebo. L-arginine also significantly reduced the length of hospital stay. The median hospital stay was 25 days and 46 days, respectively, for L-arginine and placebo ( 106500 ). L-arginine has also been investigated in combination with other ingredients for post-acute COVID symptoms. Preliminary clinical research in adults with persistent fatigue following a COVID infection shows that taking L-arginine 1.66 grams plus vitamin C 500 mg (Bioarginina C, Farmaceutici Damor) twice daily for 28 days increases the distance walked in 6 minutes by 30 meters and reduces the percentage of patients with fatigue by about 89%, when compared with placebo. Grip strength was also increased ( 110390 ). more Critical illness (trauma). Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effects when used alone are unclear. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking L-arginine orally with glutamine, nucleotides, and omega-3 fatty acids reduces the recovery time, the need for ventilation, and infection rates in critically ill patients, but does not reduce the risk of mortality ( 31853 ). more Cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity. Although there is interest in using oral L-arginine for cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for this purpose. Cystic fibrosis. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with cystic fibrosis. Preliminary clinical research in teens and adults with cystic fibrosis shows that twice daily inhalation with L-arginine 500 mg for 2 weeks does not improve lung function when compared with inhaling 2.6% hypertonic saline twice daily ( 96807 ). more Dental caries. Small clinical studies suggest that using a dentifrice containing L-arginine might prevent dental caries. A meta-analysis of small studies shows that use of a dentifrice containing L-arginine 1.5% w/w in combination with calcium base (Dical or calcium carbonate) and fluoride 1450 ppm 2-3 times daily for up to 2 years reduces the risk of developing dental caries by a small to moderate amount when compared with a dentifrice containing only fluoride in children and adults ( 96806 ). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that using a confection containing an L-arginine complex (CaviStat) for one year reduces the number of dental caries in molars of children when compared with a sugarless mint control ( 32011 ). L-arginine has also been investigated as a prebiotic in combination with probiotics. In 5- to 9-year-old children with low caries risk, clinical research shows that taking one lozenge daily for 10-12 months containing arginine 20 mg along with Lacticaseibacillus paracasei and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, modestly reduces caries severity, but does not reduce caries progression, active caries lesions, plaque, or gingivitis, when compared with placebo ( 113241 , 113242 ). more Dental hypersensitivity. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that using a toothpaste containing L-arginine, calcium, and fluoride twice daily reduces dentin hypersensitivity when compared with pretreatment or control ( 32130 , 32131 , 32132 , 32177 ). However, a small clinical study in adults shows that applying a paste containing L-arginine 8%, calcium carbonate, and potassium nitrate twice for 30 minutes does not reduce sensitivity when compared with control ( 117116 ). Another clinical study in adults shows that applying a topical combination of L-arginine 10% and ibuprofen to tooth enamel surfaces for 10 minutes prior to in-office tooth bleaching reduces the risk and intensity of tooth sensitivity when compared with placebo ( 115354 ). It is unclear whether the effects are due to L-arginine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Depression. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in adults with depression. A small, single-center clinical study in Iran in adult females with major depressive disorder taking an antidepressant shows that adding L-arginine (Made, Jalinous Pharmaceutical Company) 2 grams daily for 4 weeks does not improve symptoms of depression when compared with placebo ( 116205 ). more Diabetes. Small, low-quality studies suggest that oral L-arginine does not improve glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis of small, low-quality studies shows that taking L-arginine 2-20 grams daily for up to 77 weeks decreases fasting blood glucose and serum insulin levels in adults without diabetes. However, no improvements occurred in adults WITH type 2 diabetes. This may be explained by previous studies which suggest L-arginine affects glucose control only in the early steps of beta-cell dysfunction. L-arginine did not improve insulin resistance or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with or without diabetes ( 104225 ). Also, a prospective observational study in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes has found that taking a specific product (Flebotrofine, AMNOL Chimica Biologica) containing L-arginine for 3 months is not associated with improvements in HbA1c, cholesterol, or triglyceride levels when compared with baseline. Other ingredients in this product included diosmin, troxerutin, hesperidin, black currant extract, and gotu kola extract ( 108151 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Diabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if oral or subcutaneous L-arginine is beneficial in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. A very small clinical study shows that administering L-arginine subcutaneously at the site of diabetic foot ulcers does not decrease healing time or rate of amputation when combined with conventional therapies ( 14914 ). Also, taking a specific drink containing L-arginine 7 grams, L-glutamine 7 grams, and calcium hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 1.5 grams (Juven/Abound, Abbott Nutrition) orally twice daily for 16 weeks does not improve diabetic foot ulcer healing when compared with a control drink in non-ischemic patients or those with normal albumin levels. However, in specific populations with low albumin and/or poor limb perfusion, up to 74% more patients had total wound healing when compared with the control drink ( 96637 ). more Diabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams daily for 3 months does not improve circulation, disability, or nerve function in patients with diabetic neuropathy when compared with placebo ( 32145 ). more Head and neck cancer. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with head and neck cancer. Small clinical studies suggest that enteral nutrition supplemented with L-arginine does not seem to have any beneficial effects on markers of immune function such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), length of postoperative hospital stay, or fistula rates; however, it seems to reduce wounds and general infections after surgery in patients with head and neck cancer when compared with control ( 10160 , 32008 ). more Heart failure. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with heart failure. Preliminary clinical research in adults with heart failure shows that taking L-arginine 3.0-12.6 grams orally daily for 6-12 weeks does not consistently improve exercise tolerance or peripheral vascular resistance ( 3595 , 6028 , 32138 ). However, some research shows that taking L-arginine 1000 mg three times daily for 10 weeks modestly improves measures of cardiac function compared with placebo ( 110380 ). Although some research disagrees ( 32138 ), most research shows that taking L-arginine modestly improves quality of life ( 3595 , 110380 ). more Heart transplant complications. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients that have received a heart transplant. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 6 grams orally twice daily for 6 weeks increases walking distance and oxygen uptake and delays the ventilatory threshold in heart transplant patients when compared with baseline ( 32150 ). more HIV/AIDS-related wasting. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. One clinical study in patients with HIV/AIDS shows that taking L-arginine orally, in combination with hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) and glutamine for 8 weeks, increases body weight, particularly lean body mass, and positively affects immune status when compared with placebo ( 1909 ). However, other clinical research in HIV-positive patients shows that taking L-arginine 7.4 grams daily orally, in combination with omega-3 fatty acids and a balanced oral nutritional supplement for 6 months, does not improve body weight or fat mass, total energy intake, or immune status when compared to taking the nutritional supplement alone ( 113 ). more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral L-arginine can prevent the development of type 2 diabetes in adults with prediabetes. Clinical research shows that taking L-arginine (Bioarginine, Farmaceutici Damor) 3.2 grams orally twice daily for 18 months does not reduce the incidence of diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). However, when assessed one year after treatment discontinuation, patients who took L-arginine had a 58% lower risk of developing diabetes when compared with placebo ( 91195 ). more Infertility. It is unclear if oral L-arginine improves outcomes in people undergoing an assisted reproductive technology (ART) program. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 16 grams daily decreases the cancellation rate of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and increases the number of oocytes collected in females undergoing an ART program when compared with control. However, taking L-arginine does not seem to improve the number of viable pregnancies ( 31842 ). A small clinical study of females undergoing an ART program shows that taking a combination product containing L-arginine 1 gram with folate 200 mcg or L-arginine 2 grams, folate 400 mcg, and vitamin E 10 mg daily for 12 weeks does not affect the hCG-positive rate or clinical pregnancy rate when compared with placebo. A subgroup analysis suggests that taking these combination products might improve HCG-positive and clinical pregnancy rates in females who are undergoing ART due to male infertility ( 104224 ). However, this small study was not adequately powered to detect a difference in these outcomes, limiting the validity of these findings. more Interstitial cystitis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may improve pain in interstitial cystitis. Taking L-arginine orally seems to reduce some symptoms, especially pain, that are associated with interstitial cystitis ( 107 , 114 , 3460 , 31855 , 32267 ). Research shows that patients with interstitial cystitis having a bladder capacity greater than 800 mL and/or a history of recurrent genitourinary infections might respond more favorably to L-arginine than patients with bladder capacity less than 800 mL and/or no history of recurrent genitourinary infections. Three months of treatment may be necessary before significant symptom improvement occurs ( 3460 ). However, L-arginine does not seem to reduce the need to urinate at night or improve urgency or frequency of urination ( 3460 , 31855 ). more Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Small clinical studies suggest that oral or intravenous L-arginine may increase birthweight in IUGR. A meta-analysis of mainly small studies shows that L-arginine given orally or intravenously in the third trimester for a time period of 7 days or until delivery increases the birthweight by up to 650 grams in patients with an IUGR pregnancy. Furthermore, there is evidence from a small number of these studies that L-arginine supplementation decreases the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and fetal intracranial hemorrhage ( 96804 ). A more recent meta-analysis of small studies also shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams daily, starting in the second or third trimester usually until delivery, reduces the risk of an IUGR infant by about 32% when compared to control, including placebo or no treatment ( 110379 ). Doses used in clinical research have usually been 3 grams daily orally, although some studies have used up to 20 grams intravenously ( 31930 , 31937 , 96804 , 110379 ). However, supplementation with L-arginine does not seem to increase birthweight or reduce neonatal mortality or morbidity when compared with placebo in patients with severe IUGR ( 32083 ). more Kidney transplant. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may not improve kidney function in patients after kidney transplantation. Although preliminary clinical research showed some benefit, evidence from other clinical research shows that infusion with L-arginine does not increase renal plasma flow or glomerular filtration rate in kidney transplant patients treated with cyclosporine, including those experiencing transplant dysfunction ( 112 , 31876 , 32229 ). Other evidence suggests that intravenous L-arginine improves kidney function only in transplant patients receiving organs with a short cold ischemia time or those receiving kidneys from young donors ( 31887 ). more Male infertility. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in males with infertility. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking L-arginine 4 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve semen quality in males with oligospermia when compared with placebo ( 32209 ). However, one small clinical study shows that a specific formulation of L-arginine aspartate and maritime pine bark extract (Prelox), taken for 6 months, improves sperm quality in males with idiopathic male infertility when compared to baseline ( 32061 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if this effect is due to L-arginine, maritime pine bark, or the combination. more Migraine headache. Although there is interest in using oral L-arginine for migraine, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for this condition. Mitochondrial myopathies. Small clinical studies suggest that intravenous L-arginine may modestly improve symptoms in patients with MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome). Preliminary clinical research shows that infusions of L-arginine, 0.5 grams/kg administered within one hour of stroke-like symptoms, improves headaches, nausea, vomiting, transient blindness, and the appearance of bright spots when compared to pretreatment in patients with MELAS ( 31943 , 99263 ). Also, taking oral L-arginine 4-24 grams daily for 18 months seems to reduce the frequency and severity of stroke-like symptoms associated with MELAS when compared to baseline ( 31943 ). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking oral L-arginine 0.3-0.5 grams/kg daily in three divided doses for 2 years does not reduce the severity of MELAS symptoms, including migraine and stroke-like episodes. If a stroke-like episode did occur, administration of intravenous L-arginine 0.5 grams/kg improved headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbance ( 99263 ). The validity of this research is limited by the small study sizes and the absence of comparator groups. more Muscular dystrophy. There is limited evidence on the oral use of L-arginine in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A very small study in five children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, shows that drinking a beverage containing L-arginine hydrochloride (L-Arginine Hydrochloride, Selectchemie) 2.5 grams three times daily, in addition to metformin 250 mg twice daily, for 16 weeks improves motor function by 4% and increases distance walked in two minutes by 9.6 meters when compared to baseline ( 96805 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the very small study size and lack of a comparator group. more Nitrate tolerance. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for nitrate tolerance. A very small crossover study in adults with stable angina shows that taking L-arginine orally 700 mg four times daily for up to 10 days seems to prevent tolerance to transdermal nitrate when compared with placebo ( 8475 ). more Obesity. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may be beneficial for weight loss. A meta-analysis of mainly small clinical trials shows that taking L-arginine daily for at least 8 weeks modestly reduces body weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference when compared with placebo. However, when taking L-arginine for less than 8 weeks, BMI and body weight were not affected. The optimal dose of L-arginine was 2-6 grams ( 110398 ). An additional small clinical study suggests that taking a specific arginine supplement (NOW Foods) 3 grams by mouth three times daily for 12 weeks, in addition to receiving dietary counseling, reduces waist circumference by 4-6 cm and reduces body weight by 1.8-2.9 kg when compared to baseline in obese females 18-40 years of age ( 91193 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Oral mucositis. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. One small clinical study shows that taking a specific combination of L-arginine 7 grams, L-glutamine 7 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 1.2 grams (Abound; Abbott) in water twice daily during chemoradiotherapy treatment for head and neck cancer does not reduce the incidence of severe oral mucositis when compared with a historical control ( 99243 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a placebo control. Additionally, a small open-label study in patients undergoing chemoradiation for head and neck cancer shows that taking a specific combination product (Abound, Abbot) containing L-arginine, glutamine, and HMB twice daily throughout chemoradiation treatments decreases the incidence of grade 3 or higher oral mucositis and ameliorates body weight loss when compared with no intervention ( 113726 ). However, the incidence of grade 2 or higher oral mucositis was not reduced. It is unclear if this effect is due to L-arginine, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of the study is limited by the lack of blinding. more Pain (acute). Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A single-center clinical study in adults in Brazil undergoing dental surgery shows that taking L-arginine 555 mg with ibuprofen 30 minutes prior to receiving an alveolar nerve block increases the number of nerve blocks associated with no pain or only mild pain when compared with placebo, but not when compared with ibuprofen ( 117115 ). more Periodontitis. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with periodontitis. Preliminary clinical research in patients with chronic periodontitis shows that using L-arginine aspartate (Yuria-Pharm, Ukraine) 1 gram three times daily orally for 10 days after scaling and root planing, modestly reduces bleeding on probing but not periodontal pocket depth, when compared with untreated controls ( 108926 ). more Physical performance. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for improving physical performance in older adults. A small study in physically active females 65 years of age and older shows that taking L-arginine 8 grams as a single dose does not improve lower body strength, measured by knee flexion and extension tests, or functional performance, measured by sit-stand, tandem gait, and timed up-and-go tests, when compared with placebo ( 96812 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of N-acetylcysteine 1200 mg daily plus L-arginine 1600 mg daily for 6 months modestly improves menstrual function and decreases insulin resistance in patients with PCOS when compared to baseline ( 32094 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Postoperative infection. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Small clinical studies show that taking L-arginine, enterally or orally, either before or after surgery, in combination with fish oil, or with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), seems to reduce the rate of perioperative infection when compared with a control group. The risk of infection was 41% lower when compared to taking no arginine-based formulations. However, there is no good evidence to support the use of L-arginine alone for this purpose, and it is possible that this effect is due to the other ingredients or the combination of ingredients ( 5531 , 32174 , 32196 ). more Postoperative pain. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small, single-center clinical study in adults in Brazil undergoing dental surgery shows that taking L-arginine 370 mg in combination with ibuprofen prior to surgery, with or without dexamethasone, reduces the total amount of postoperative medication needed when compared with placebo. Although taking L-arginine with ibuprofen and dexamethasone reduced patient-reported pain overall, there was no difference at individual time points (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8 hours) ( 116208 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to L-arginine, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Postoperative recovery. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Small clinical studies show that taking L-arginine, enterally or orally, either before or after surgery, in combination with fish oil, or with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), seems to reduce the recovery time after surgery or serious illness when compared with a control group. This seems to be related to a reduced number of perioperative infections and improved wound healing. However, there is no good evidence to support the use of L-arginine alone for this purpose, and it is possible that this effect is due to the other ingredients or the combination of ingredients ( 5531 , 32174 , 32196 ). Additionally, 2 small single-center clinical studies in Japan and Iran in adults show that taking a combination of L-arginine 7-14 grams, glutamine 7-14 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate 1.5-3 grams (Heallagen or Abound) daily for 2-4 weeks before heart surgery reduces hospital stay by 1-4 days and intensive care unit stay by 1 day when compared with control ( 110394 , 116206 ). Additionally, walking distance was improved after surgery ( 116206 ). Furthermore, recovery, based on some biochemical and other measurements, was improved, but there was no difference in overall postoperative complications ( 110394 ). However, in another clinical study, taking a combination product (Abound, Abbott) containing L-arginine 7 grams, glutamine 7 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate 1.2 grams orally daily for 3 days before and 7 days after abdominal surgery did not reduce the incidence of wound infection or other complications when compared with placebo ( 99413 ). The discrepancies between these studies may be related to differences in the dose or duration of the combination product, the outcomes measured, and/or the type of surgery. more Pressure ulcers. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Oral L-arginine has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for the treatment of grade II-IV pressure ulcers. Two small clinical studies in hospitalized patients show that administering an oral nutritional supplement enriched with L-arginine, zinc, and vitamin C improves ulcer healing when compared with a standard diet ( 31953 , 87173 ). A small, retrospective study in sedentary older adults in care facilities shows that taking a specific nutritional supplement (Abound, Abbott) containing L-arginine 7.4 grams, L-glutamine 7.4 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 1.3 grams twice daily until the complete healing of the pressure ulcer reduces time to complete healing to 170 days on average, compared with 218 days on average in the control group ( 110396 ). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients living in long-term care facilities with grade II-IV pressure ulcers shows that taking an oral nutritional supplement enriched in protein, energy, L-arginine, vitamin C, and zinc daily for 9 weeks reduces ulcer area and decreases oozing when compared to baseline ( 32045 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Preterm labor. Small clinical studies suggest that oral L-arginine may prevent preterm labor. A meta-analysis of three small studies shows that taking L-arginine 3-6.6 grams daily, starting in the second or third trimester usually until delivery, reduces the risk of preterm labor by about 50% when compared to control, usually placebo ( 110379 ). more Pulmonary hypertension. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in children with pulmonary hypertension related to beta-thalassemia. Preliminary clinical research in children aged 6-18 years treated conventionally for pulmonary hypertension related to beta-thalassemia shows that taking L-arginine 0.1 mg/kg daily for 60 days reduces Doppler echocardiography pulmonary arterial pressure by 35% compared with baseline. This measurement was increased by up to 15% in children given conventional treatments only; however, a statistical comparison between these treatment groups was lacking ( 110391 ). more Radiation dermatitis. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with head and neck cancer shows that taking a combination of L-arginine 7 grams, L-glutamine 7 grams, and hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) 1.2 grams (Abound, Abbott) in water twice daily from the first day of radiation to approximately 1 week after completion does not reduce the number of patients with severe dermatitis when compared with taking no supplement. However, there was a 34% reduction in the incidence of moderate dermatitis and the overall duration of dermatitis was reduced ( 96639 ). more Respiratory tract infections. Although there is interest in using oral L-arginine for respiratory tract infections, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for these conditions. Restenosis. It is unclear if intravenous L-arginine helps to prevent restenosis after stent implantation. Some clinical research suggests that intravenous and intracoronary infusion of L-arginine during stent implantation followed by oral L-arginine for 2 weeks does not reduce the risk of restenosis when compared with placebo ( 31925 ). However, local delivery of 6 mL of L-arginine 100 mg/mL for 15 minutes after stent deployment seems to reduce neointimal formation at 6 months after stent placement when compared with placebo ( 31883 ). more Schizophrenia. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial in patients with schizophrenia. A small clinical study shows that taking L-arginine 3 grams twice daily for 3 weeks, in conjunction with an individualized medication regimen, does not improve positive, negative, or depressive symptoms associated with schizophrenia when compared with taking the medication regimen alone ( 99264 ). more Sexual dysfunction. It is unclear if oral L-arginine is beneficial for sexual dysfunction in females. A small, single-center clinical study in Iran in adult females with major depressive disorder and taking an antidepressant shows that taking L-arginine (Made, Jalinous Pharmaceutical Company) 2 grams daily for 8 weeks does not improve patient-reported symptoms of sexual dysfunction (e.g., arousal, desire, lubrication) when compared with placebo ( 116205 ). However, results from combination therapy differ. Clinical research in females with sexual dysfunction who are taking oral contraceptives shows that taking a specific combination product (Lady Prelox, Horphag Research) containing L-arginine, maritime pine bark extract, L-citrulline, and rose hip extract daily for 8 weeks improves symptoms of sexual dysfunction by 18% when compared with a control group ( 91963 ). Taking the same product in a dose of 2 tablets twice daily for 8 weeks, in addition to the lifestyle management program, improves vaginal dryness in pre- and post-menopausal patients when compared with lifestyle management alone ( 103611 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to L-arginine, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Sickle cell disease. Small clinical studies suggest that oral or intravenous L-arginine may modestly improve complications in patients with sickle cell disease. Two small clinical studies in hospitalized children aged 3-19 years with sickle cell disease-related veno-occlusive crisis shows that administering L-arginine intravenously or orally 100 mg/kg three times daily for 5 days or until discharge reduces total opioid use by 26% to 54%, pain scores at discharge by 23%, and median length of hospital stay by about 36 hours when compared with placebo ( 97392 , 105063 ). Another very small clinical study in patients aged 13-63 years with sickle cell disease shows that taking L-arginine 0.1 grams/kg orally three times daily for 5 days reduces pulmonary hypertension when compared to baseline ( 11428 ). more Stress. Oral L-arginine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking a single dose of L-arginine 50 mg plus L-theanine 200 mg modestly reduces stress associated with a stress-loading test when compared with placebo, but was no more effective than taking L-theanine alone ( 110393 ). more Valproic acid-induced toxicities. Although there is interest in using intravenous L-arginine for valproic acid toxicity, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of L-arginine for this purpose. More evidence is needed to rate L-arginine for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately. L-arginine has been used safely in clinical studies at doses of up to 24 grams daily for up to 18 months ( 3331 , 3460 , 3595 , 3596 , 5531 , 5532 , 5533 , 6028 , 7815 , 7816 )( 8014 , 8473 , 13709 , 31943 , 91195 , 91196 , 91963 , 99264 , 99267 , 110380 )( 110387 ).

  "mechanism_text": "General L-arginine is an amino acid necessary for protein synthesis. It is found naturally in foods such as red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products ( 3330 ). L-arginine is best known for its effects on the vascular system. L-arginine is a substrate for the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme. In human research, taking L-arginine has been shown to increase blood levels of nitric oxide (NO) ( 110391 ). In vascular endothelial cells, NOS converts L-arginine to NO, also known as endothelium-derived relaxation factor (EDRF), which causes vasodilation. L-arginine can improve coronary endothelial function and brachial artery endothelium-dependent dilation and reduce monocyte/endothelial cell adhesion in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or hypercholesterolemia, resulting in increased coronary blood flow ( 110 , 116 , 1362 , 1363 , 3330 , 13710 , 14913 , 32017 ). Anti-inflammatory effects In human research, L-arginine does not seem to have anti-inflammatory effects based on blood levels of inflammatory mediators including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) ( 102589 , 102590 , 112128 ). Similarly, L-arginine does not seem to alter levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 ( 112128 ). In some individuals, including those over 60 years and those with cancer, CRP levels might be increased ( 102589 ). Antibacterial effects L-arginine has been studied for antibacterial effects ( 32013 , 31909 , 32041 , 32024 , 32196 ). Nitric oxide might be involved in host inflammatory and microbial killing responses ( 3460 ). When used in the mouth, L-arginine is thought to be converted to ammonia by oral non-pathogenic bacteria, increasing the local pH and reducing the cariogenicity of other bacteria ( 96806 ). Anticancer effects There is interest in L-arginine for adjunctive use in treating breast cancer. The enzyme amino-peptidase N/CD13 (APN) has been associated with the growth of cancers such as breast cancer. Laboratory research shows that certain L-arginine derivatives inhibit the APN N/CD13 enzyme ( 32092 ). In addition, there is some evidence that L-arginine modifies immune system function and might potentiate tumor cell response to anti-cancer drugs and possibly reduce the immunosuppressive effects of chemotherapy agents. L-arginine seems to increase lymphocyte reactivity to polyclonal mitogenic agents and might also enhance natural cytotoxicity ( 3331 ). However, L-arginine also promotes the growth of tumors by providing a source of nitrogen. In some situations the nutritional value of L-arginine may outweigh its antitumor effects ( 7814 ). Anticonvulsive effects Nitric oxide can help prevent seizures. L-arginine can increase nitric oxide levels. Animal research shows that giving L-arginine to rats with drug-induced seizures increases the time to first seizure and decreases seizure-induced mortality. This therapeutic effect may be due to increased nitric oxide levels ( 32121 ). Antidiabetic effects People with diabetes appear to have lower than normal levels of L-arginine, and increased levels of the enzyme asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADME), which might contribute to peripheral vascular disease in people with diabetes ( 14913 ). L-arginine is metabolized to L-ornithine, then to L-proline, which is used in collagen synthesis and wound healing ( 14914 ). However, if metabolized through a different pathway, L-arginine may have a negative effect on diabetic ulcers. Increased levels of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) can increase the metabolism of L-arginine to nitric oxide (NO) and may impair diabetic ulcer healing due to NO's free radical effects on tissues ( 14915 ). L-arginine may help increase glucose disposal ( 31875 ), increase insulin sensitivity ( 32269 ), and increase plasma insulin levels in response to meals ( 32136 ) in diabetic and pre-diabetic patients. It has been proposed that L-arginine increases adiponectin secretion in the adipose tissue and may increase insulin sensitivity by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, which can improve glucose uptake and utilization by the muscles ( 104225 ). Antioxidant effects Research is conflicting on whether L-arginine protects against oxidative stress. Some evidence shows that L-arginine has antioxidant effects and can reduce lipid peroxidation. This might prevent damage by oxidant radicals and attenuate damage from numerous conditions including myocardial ischemia, atherosclerosis, and stress ( 31926 , 31931 , 31964 , 32161 , 32179 , 32259 , 110385 ). However, a meta-analysis of 2 clinical studies shows that L-arginine does not improve antioxidant status as measured by superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. Additionally, 4 clinical studies in the meta-analysis found that L-arginine does not modulate markers of oxidative stress including thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, carbonyls, uric acid, malondialdehyde (MDA), neutrophil MDA, creatine, and lactate dehydrogenase ( 112128 ). Cardiovascular effects L-arginine has been assessed for a number of cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. L-arginine has been studied for its antihypertensive effects. The production of NO from L-arginine and NO-induced vasodilation may be responsible for mildly reducing blood pressure ( 10636 , 32266 ). However, a meta-analysis of patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity, shows that taking L-arginine does not improve flow-mediated dilation or NO ( 99262 ). L-arginine reduces the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme, decreasing the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and also increases aldosterone, which signals for increased water and sodium retention. Therefore, the blood pressure lowering effects of L-arginine can be attributed to reducing angiotensin I conversion ( 7820 ). Some evidence is available indicating the effect on coronary blood flow is larger in African-Americans than in Caucasians ( 8472 ). L-arginine seems to prevent nitrate tolerance by improving nitric acid bioavailability and may act as an antioxidant, decreasing production of vascular superoxide ( 8475 ). The production of NO from L-arginine substrate is impaired in patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) ( 8016 ). Intravenous L-arginine can have many beneficial hemodynamic effects in heart failure, including decreased heart rate (8 beats/minute), decreased mean arterial pressure (14 mmHg), increased cardiac output (0.7 l/minute), and increased stroke volume (14 mL) ( 8444 ). The beneficial effect of L-arginine on NO may help patients with vaso-occlusive crisis or pulmonary hypertension secondary to sickle cell disease. Adults and children experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis have lower plasma concentrations of arginine when compared to sickle cell patients not experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis ( 97392 ). L-arginine donates nitrogen for NO synthesis. L-arginine also decreases levels of circulating plasma endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor ( 11428 ). In most people with a normal diet, the concentration of L-arginine inside the cells of the body is adequate to ensure that the NOS enzyme is producing NO at maximal capacity. As a result, L-arginine supplementation is likely to be more effective in patients who have a deficiency of L-arginine ( 7820 ). L-arginine has actions on the cardiovascular system and other systems that are independent of the conversion to NO. Among other actions, L-arginine can directly reduce blood viscosity, reduce the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme, and reduce lipid peroxidation ( 7820 ). The decrease in blood viscosity can be attributed to L-arginine induced decreases in platelet aggregation ( 31864 , 32188 , 32220 , 32239 , 32257 , 32260 , 32263 , 32276 ). However, L-arginine does not seem to have anti-inflammatory effects based on blood levels of inflammatory mediators including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) ( 102589 , 102590 ). In some individuals, including those over 60 years and those with cancer, CRP levels might be increased ( 102589 ). Exercise effects L-arginine has been used to improve exercise performance. It is possible that L-arginine works by improving oxygen utilization in active young adult males ( 32104 ). However, L-arginine supplementation does not seem to have this effect in trained athletes ( 32170 , 32158 ). L-arginine supplementation in healthy adults and trained athletes may reduce levels of creatine kinase, lactate, and/or ammonia during or following exercise. It is unclear if these changes are significant enough to play a role in improved exercise performance ( 31894 , 110381 , 110389 , 116207 ). Finally, in rats, L-arginine oral supplementation appears to attenuate oxidative stress that is induced by exercise ( 32005 ). Genitourinary effects Besides its effect on the systemic cardiovascular system, NO also increases the relaxation of urinary tract smooth muscle ( 3259 , 3460 , 31878 ) and is involved in erectile function. Although L-arginine appears to be helpful for erectile dysfunction, L-arginine may not affect the hemodynamics of the corpus cavernosum ( 222 ). L-arginine also increases gastrin concentrations and inhibits tubular reabsorption of protein ( 3331 , 3460 , 8015 ). L-arginine can increase renal plasma flow and decrease renal vascular resistance, and increase glomerular filtration rate, natriuresis, kaliuresis, and creatinine clearance in some patients ( 7822 , 31839 , 31860 , 31879 , 31904 , 31910 , 31962 , 32062 , 32224 , 32251 )( 32284 , 104222 ). Heavy metal protective effects L-arginine may have protective effects for heavy metal exposure. In animals, L-arginine appears to reduce mercury accumulation in the thymus after exposure to mercury ( 32058 ). Hormonal effects Physiologic actions of L-arginine include stimulating the release of growth hormone (GH), prolactin, glucagon, and insulin ( 7820 , 31862 ). L-arginine also increases levels of testosterone in males ( 102586 , 104222 ). Immunological effects L-arginine enhances immune function in laboratory research, as well as in human research when given with ribonucleic acid (RNA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ( 5532 , 5533 , 7819 , 32036 , 32109 , 32192 ). In patients with colorectal cancer, L-arginine improved cellular and humoral immune activity via an increase in CD4+ T cells and IgA, IgG, and IgM levels, ( 117114 ). However, in elderly immunocompromised nursing home residents with pressure ulcers, L-arginine supplementation did not appear to improve or worsen immune function ( 31863 , 31946 ). Supplementing sickle cell patients with L-arginine also did not result in notable improvement in immune function ( 32171 ). Neurological effects L-arginine may have neuroprotective effects. In an animal amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model, L-arginine protected motor neurons from injury, delayed onset of motor dysfunction, and prolonged life span. This protective effect may be attributed to preservation of arginase I activity and neuroprotective polyamines in the spinal cord ( 32088 ). Nutrigenomics The arginase 1 (ARG1) and arginase 2 (ARG2) genes may impact the bioavailability of L-arginine in humans. Observational research in L-arginine supplement users found that a higher prevalence of the minor allele of ARG1 rs2246012 is associated with higher blood L-arginine concentrations. Genetic variation in ARG1 may impact L-arginine absorption. Genetic variation in ARG2 genes may impact arginine levels in adults that do not take L-arginine supplements ( 105061 ). Ocular effects In healthy volunteers, L-arginine increases choroidal blood flow and retinal vein blood flow which may be helpful for patients with glaucoma ( 31948 ). Pulmonary effects Inhaling L-arginine increases the production of nitric oxide in the lungs. Orally, animal models show L-arginine decreases airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. However, in humans, L-arginine does not seem to reduce inflammation or improve lung function ( 96807 , 104223 ). Reproductive effects L-arginine has been used to help with infertility. Laboratory research suggests that nitric oxide from L-arginine may stimulate motility and metabolism of sperm from asthenospermic patients ( 32163 ). L-arginine supplementation affects nitric oxide production and improves uterine blood flow and endometrial thickness in females ( 104224 ). Weight loss effects L-arginine has been studied for weight loss in obese patients ( 91193 ). In animals, dietary L-arginine appears to increase lipolysis in adipose tissue ( 32173 ). Some human research suggests that L-arginine can increase the production of postprandial hormones involved in appetite suppression, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) ( 110397 ). Wound-healing effects L-arginine is metabolized to L-ornithine, then to L-proline, which is used in collagen synthesis and wound healing ( 14914 ). L-arginine is a precursor for collagen synthesis and together with fibroblast NO production is thought to be important for wound healing ( 3259 , 3260 ).",
