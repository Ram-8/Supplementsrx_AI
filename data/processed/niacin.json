  "overview_text": "Niacin is one form of vitamin B3. Its amide, niacinamide, is the other form. Niacin is found in many foods, including yeast, meat, fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, and cereal grains. Dietary tryptophan, which is found in protein-containing foods such as red meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy, is also converted to niacin after ingestion. Consumption of tryptophan 60 mg equals 1 mg of niacin",
  "effectiveness_text": "Expand All | Collapse All Likely Effective Dyslipidemia. Niacin prescription products, in doses of 500 mg or greater, are FDA-approved for primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Niacin dietary supplements are generally available in lower doses and have not been shown to improve lipid levels. Prescription niacin is not routinely recommended as second-line therapy for patients who primarily need to decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This is due to results from clinical trials showing no effect on cardiovascular related events or mortality ( 93346 , 93354 , 96208 , 96211 , 97308 , 97477 , 97336 ). However, niacin might be considered for patients with mixed hyperlipidemia or patients who need to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lower triglycerides. Niacin might also be effective for isolated hypoalphalipoproteinemia ( 4817 ). The most pronounced increases in HDL and decreases in triglycerides occur at 1-1.5 grams daily, and the greatest LDL reduction occurs at 2-3 grams daily. Niacin reduces LDL cholesterol by up to 25%, compared with up to a 55% reduction with statins. High-dose niacin can also decrease triglycerides by 20% to 50%, increase HDL by 13% to 35%, decrease apolipoprotein B levels by 2% to 20%, and decrease lipoprotein(a) levels by 23% ( 4818 , 4886 , 4887 , 4888 , 4889 , 4890 , 12033 , 25567 , 93347 , 96213 ). The effects of higher dose extended-release niacin on LDL cholesterol and triglycerides appear to be greater in females than males ( 25565 ). Experts recommend maximizing statins first because they have the best evidence for improving cardiovascular outcomes ( 97477 , 97336 , 97337 ). However, if patients cannot reach their LDL goal with a statin alone or if they cannot tolerate a statin, niacin might be combined with other cholesterol-lowering drugs when diet and single-drug therapy are not adequately effective ( 8545 , 25566 , 93351 , 94191 , 97337 ). Adding low-dose niacin, 50 mg daily, to statin therapy has no additional benefit on lipid levels ( 8546 ). Population research in adults without dyslipidemia has also found that higher dietary intake of niacin for 3-10 years is associated with a 29% lower risk of developing dyslipidemia when compared with low dietary niacin intake ( 110493 ). more Pellagra. Oral niacin is FDA-approved for the prevention and treatment of pellagra. Population research has found that low consumption of niacin is associated with an increased risk of developing pellagra ( 25903 ). Taking niacin 500-1000 mg daily can resolve symptoms of pellagra within a week of treatment initiation ( 25904 ). However, niacinamide is sometimes preferred for this indication because it lacks the vasodilating effects of niacin ( 15 , 6243 ). more Possibly Effective HIV/AIDS-related dyslipidemia. Oral niacin seems to improve lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia due to HIV/AIDs. Small clinical trials in HIV patients with dyslipidemia associated with antiretroviral therapy shows that taking extended-release niacin (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) titrated up to 2 grams daily for 14-48 weeks improves total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels when compared to baseline ( 25570 , 25902 ). Other preliminary clinical research in this population shows that taking extended-release niacin (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) titrated to 2 grams daily for up to 2 years improves HDL cholesterol levels, but not total cholesterol or triglyceride levels, when compared with no treatment ( 25569 ). more Metabolic syndrome. Oral niacin seems to improve lipid levels in patients with metabolic syndrome. Clinical research shows that taking niacin (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) 2 grams daily orally for 16 weeks reduces triglyceride levels by 39 mg/dL and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 5 mg/dL when compared to baseline in patients with metabolic syndrome. These improvements are significant when compared with placebo and are further increased when niacin is taken along with prescription omega-3 ethyl esters (Lovaza, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals) 4 grams daily orally ( 93353 ). However, niacin does not seem to improve postprandial glucose levels in patients with metabolic syndrome ( 97333 ). more Ineffective Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral niacin does not seem to reduce cardiovascular-related events in patients with or without CVD. Overall, niacin is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. Most clinical trials and meta-analyses conducted prior to 2011 showed a reduction in cardiovascular-related events, cardiovascular-related mortality, and all-cause mortality in patients taking niacin alone or in combination with a statin or clofibrate for primary or secondary prevention of CVD ( 4847 , 7388 , 25095 , 25911 , 25912 , 93349 ). However, recent meta-analyses of these studies and additional moderate-to-high quality research conducted in over 39,000 patients show no effect of niacin on cardiovascular-related events, cardiovascular-related mortality, or overall mortality ( 93346 , 93354 , 96208 , 96211 , 97308 ). Additionally, one meta-analysis shows that patients taking niacin are twice as likely to report side effects when compared with placebo ( 96211 ). Furthermore, an analysis of blood from adults at high cardiovascular risk suggests that higher levels of circulating niacin terminal metabolites are associated with greater risk of major adverse cardiovascular events independent of traditional risk factors ( 113554 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Alzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for reducing Alzheimer disease risk. Observational research has found that consuming higher amounts of niacin (17-45 mg daily) from food and supplements is associated with a slower cognitive decline and a lower risk of developing Alzheimer disease when compared with people who consume less niacin (14 mg daily) ( 12077 ). It is not known if the risk of Alzheimer disease is reduced by taking a stand-alone niacin supplement. more Atherosclerosis. It is unclear if oral niacin prevents atherosclerosis progression. Preliminary clinical studies show that taking niacin orally, in combination with colestipol for up to 2 years, might modestly reduce progression of atherosclerosis as measured by coronary lesions and carotid arterial intima-media thickness in high-risk males with existing coronary atherosclerosis ( 25906 , 25909 , 25910 ). However, niacin does not seem to be better than statins. One clinical study in adults with atherosclerosis and peripheral arterial disease shows that taking extended-release niacin 1500 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, and ezetimibe 10 mg daily for 2 years does not reduce atherosclerosis of the superficial femoral artery when compared with simvastatin alone ( 96208 ). Niacin has also not been shown to prevent cardiovascular events or mortality ( 93346 , 93354 , 96208 , 96211 , 97308 ). more Athletic performance. It is unclear if oral niacin improves athletic performance. Preliminary clinical research in untrained adult males shows that taking niacin 1000 mg orally once before a cycling test does not improve power, respiratory exchange ratio, or time to exhaustion when compared with placebo. In addition, these measures were significantly worse when compared with taking caffeine 5 mg/kg orally as a single dose ( 107942 ). Clinical research in untrained males also shows that taking a supplement containing niacin 40 mg, caffeine 400 mg, capsicum extract 66.7 mg, and black pepper extract 10 mg prior to exercising does not improve strength, time to exhaustion, or maximal oxygen consumption when compared with placebo ( 37873 ). more Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there is interest in using oral niacin for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this condition. Cancer. It is unclear if dietary niacin is beneficial for cancer. Population research in adults with cancer has found that high dietary niacin intake is associated with 49% and 27% lower risk of cancer-related mortality and all-cause mortality when compared with low dietary niacin intake. The same study also found that taking niacin supplements is associated with a lower risk of cancer-related mortality, but not all-cause mortality when compared with not taking niacin supplements ( 110496 ). more Cataracts. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for preventing cataracts. Population research has found that high dietary intake of niacin is associated with a reduced risk of nuclear cataracts ( 6378 ). However, there is no reliable evidence that niacin supplements reduce the risk of cataracts. more Cholera. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for cholera. One small clinical study in adults with severe cholera shows that taking 1-2 grams niacin orally reduces fluid loss in the stool by 31% to 47% in the first 16 hours when compared with control. The 2 gram dose seemed to result in a greater reduction in fluid loss than the 1 gram dose ( 4868 ). more Erectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial in patients with ED and dyslipidemia. Clinical research in patients with erectile dysfunction and dyslipidemia shows that taking extended-release niacin (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) titrated to 1.5 grams nightly for a total of 12 weeks significantly improves penetration frequency and the maintenance of an erection after penetration when compared to baseline ( 25913 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Glaucoma. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for preventing or treating glaucoma. Population research has found that higher dietary intake of niacin is associated with a lower odds of having glaucoma. However, this association was not consistently present when adjusting for confounders. The effects of niacin supplementation on glaucoma have not been evaluated ( 107942 ). more Hyperphosphatemia. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for preventing high levels of phosphorus in the blood. Preliminary clinical research in patients on maintenance dialysis who are no longer using phosphate binders shows that taking niacin 375-750 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces serum phosphorus levels by 2.1 mg/dL, increases calcium levels by 0.4 mg/dL, and decreases serum alkaline phosphatase when compared with baseline ( 25914 ). A small clinical study in Iranian adults on maintenance hemodialysis, with baseline serum phosphorus levels within normal range, shows that adding niacin 600 mg daily to standard of care for 8 weeks slightly reduces serum phosphorus levels when compared with control ( 116763 ). Clinical significance is unlikely. However, clinical research in patients on dialysis with inadequate phosphate control despite standard phosphate-binding therapy shows that taking niacin at the maximum tolerated dose, up to 1000 mg daily, for 12 weeks, does not decrease serum phosphate levels when compared with placebo ( 93341 ). It is possible that this latter study was too small to observe between-group differences in changes in serum phosphate levels. more Hypertension. It is unclear if dietary niacin is beneficial for preventing hypertension. Observational research in Chinese adults found a J-shaped association between dietary niacin intake and development of hypertension, with the lowest risk occurring in those with a daily dietary niacin intake of 14.3-16.7 mg ( 104934 ). more Meniere disease. Although there is interest in using oral niacin for Meniere disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this condition. Migraine headache. It is unclear if dietary niacin is beneficial for preventing migraine headaches. Population research in adults has found that high dietary intake of niacin is associated with a 28% lower likelihood of having migraine headaches when compared with low dietary intake of niacin ( 110495 ). However, the effect of niacin supplementation on migraines has not been studied. more Motion sickness. Although there is interest in using oral niacin for motion sickness, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this purpose. Parkinson disease. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for improving Parkinson disease symptoms. Low-quality clinical research in adults with Parkinson disease shows that taking slow-release niacin 250 mg orally daily for 12 months improves Parkinson disease motor scores and fatigue scores by 17% and 26%, respectively, when compared with baseline ( 107944 ). However, higher quality clinical research shows that taking niacin 250 mg orally daily for 6 months does not improve Parkinson disease motor scores when compared with placebo ( 107943 ). more Retinal vein occlusion. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for improving retinal vein occlusion symptoms. A small case series in patients with chronic retinal vein occlusion shows that taking niacin titrated to 500 mg three times daily for 1 year is associated with reduced central macular thickness and improved visual acuity in over 50% of patients when compared with a control group. The addition of prednisolone eye drops does not alter the outcomes of those taking niacin ( 96212 ). The validity of this finding is limited due to the retrospective nature of this study. more Schizophrenia. Although there is interest in using oral niacin for schizophrenia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this condition. Sickle cell disease. It is unclear if oral niacin is beneficial for improving lipid levels in patients with sickle cell disease. A small clinical study in patients with sickle cell disease shows that taking extended-release niacin titrated to 1.5 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve vascular function or increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or apolipoprotein A-I cholesterol levels when compared with placebo ( 96209 ). more Vertigo. Although there is interest in using oral niacin for vertigo, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of niacin for this condition. More evidence is needed to rate niacin for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Likely Safe when niacin is taken in food or as a supplement in amounts below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 30 mg daily for adults 18 years of age and 35 mg daily for adults 19 years and older ( 6243 ). ...when prescription products are used orally and appropriately in doses of up to 2 grams daily ( 12033 ). Likely Safe when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The ULs of niacin for children are: 1-3 years of age, 10 mg daily; 4-8 years of age, 15 mg daily; 9-13 years of age, 20 mg daily; 14-18 years of age, 30 mg daily ( 6243 ). CHILDREN : PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL of niacin during pregnancy and lactation is 30 mg daily for 14-18 years of age and 35 mg daily for 19 years and older ( 6243 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of larger oral doses of niacin during pregnancy or lactation; avoid using.",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: General : Niacin is expressed on supplement labels as Niacin Equivalents (NE). 1 mg of niacin is the same as 1 mg NE. However, the total niacin content stated on a label can also include other forms of niacin, including niacinamide, inositol nicotinate, and tryptophan. Tryptophan 60 mg, niacinamide 1 mg, and inositol nicotinate 1 mg are all equivalent to 1 mg NE ( 6243 ). The Institute of Medicine publishes a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin B3, which includes niacin and niacinamide. The daily RDA of vitamin B3, expressed as NE, is: males 14 years and older, 16 mg NE; females 14 years and older, 14 mg NE; pregnancy, 18 mg NE; and breastfeeding, 17 mg NE ( 6243 ). Prescription niacin is most often used at a dose of 1-2 grams daily. Research on the use of supplemental niacin is limited. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Concomitant ingestion of hot drinks with niacin may magnify niacin-induced flushing ( 6243 ). Children Oral: General : The daily adequate intake (AI) of vitamin B3 for infants 0-6 months of age is 2 mg of preformed niacin. For all other age groups, the daily recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin B3 (niacin or niacinamide) is expressed as niacin equivalents (NE). The RDA for children is: 7-12 months of age, 4 mg NE; 1-3 years of age, 6 mg NE; 4-8 years of age, 8 mg NE; 9-13 years of age, 12 mg NE; females 14-18 years of age, 14 mg NE; males 14-18 years of age, 16 mg NE ( 6243 ). Research is limited; typical dosing of supplemental niacin is unavailable. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization & Formulation Niacin is available in immediate-release formulations and, by prescription, in extended-release formulations. One specific extended-release niacin prescription formulation (Niaspan, Abbott Laboratories) releases niacin at a rate of 100 mg/hour ( 18 ).",
  "interactions_text": "Expand All | Collapse All ALCOHOL (Ethanol) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Concomitant use of alcohol and niacin might increase the risk of flushing and hepatotoxicity. Alcohol can exacerbate the flushing and pruritus associated with niacin ( 4458 , 11689 ). Large doses of niacin might also exacerbate liver dysfunction associated with chronic alcohol use. A case report describes delirium and lactic acidosis in a patient taking niacin 3 grams daily who ingested 1 liter of wine ( 14510 ). Advise patients to avoid large amounts of alcohol while taking niacin. more ALLOPURINOL (Zyloprim) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence C (Expert opinion) Theoretically, niacin might antagonize the therapeutic effects of uricosurics such as allopurinol. Large doses of niacin can reduce urinary excretion of uric acid, potentially resulting in hyperuricemia ( 4860 , 4863 , 12033 ). Doses of uricosurics such as allopurinol might need to be increased to maintain control of gout in patients who start taking niacin ( 4458 ). People who have frequent attacks of gout despite uricosuric therapy should avoid niacin ( 4863 ). more ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, niacin may have additive effects when used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. Several cases of clotting factor synthesis deficiency and coagulopathy have been reported in patients taking sustained-release niacin ( 25915 ). Also, thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients treated with niacin or niacin plus lovastatin ( 25916 ). more ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Niacin can increase blood glucose levels and may diminish the effects of antidiabetes drugs. Niacin impairs glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, probably by causing or aggravating insulin resistance and increasing hepatic production of glucose ( 4860 , 4863 , 11692 , 11693 ). In diabetes patients, niacin 4.5 grams daily for 5 weeks can increase plasma glucose by an average of 16% and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 21% ( 4860 ). However, lower doses of 1.5 grams daily or less appear to have minimal effects on blood glucose ( 12033 ). In some patients, glucose levels increase when niacin is started, but then return to baseline when a stable dose is reached ( 12033 , 93344 ). Up to 35% of patients with diabetes may need adjustments in hypoglycemic therapy when niacin is added ( 4458 , 4860 , 4863 , 11689 , 12033 ). more ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Clinical cohort study) Theoretically, niacin may increase the risk of hypotension when used with antihypertensive drugs. The vasodilating effects of niacin can cause hypotension ( 4863 , 12033 , 93341 ). Furthermore, some clinical evidence suggests that a one-hour infusion of niacin can reduce systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure in hypertensive patients. This effect is not observed in normotensive patients ( 25917 ). more ASPIRIN Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity INSIGNIFICANT Occurrence LIKELY Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Large doses of aspirin might alter the clearance of niacin. Aspirin is often used with niacin to reduce niacin-induced flushing ( 4458 , 11689 ). Doses of 80-975 mg aspirin have been used, but 325 mg appears to be optimal ( 4458 , 4852 , 4853 , 11689 ). Aspirin also seems to reduce the clearance of niacin by competing for glycine conjugation. Taking aspirin 1 gram seems to reduce niacin clearance by 45% ( 14524 ). This is probably a dose-related effect and not clinically significant with the more common aspirin dose of 325 mg ( 11689 , 14524 ). more BILE ACID SEQUESTRANTS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Bile acid sequestrants can bind niacin and decrease absorption. Separate administration by 4-6 hours to avoid an interaction. In vitro studies show that colestipol (Colestid) binds about 98% of available niacin and cholestyramine (Questran) binds 10% to 30% ( 14511 ). more GEMFIBROZIL (Lopid) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use of niacin and gemfibrozil might increase the risk of myopathy in some patients. A case of myopathy from concomitant use of niacin and gemfibrozil has been reported ( 25920 ). Niacin alone has also been associated with cases of myopathy ( 26100 , 26111 ). Using gemfibrozil with niacin might further increase the risk of developing myopathy. more HEPATOTOXIC DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use of niacin and hepatotoxic drugs might increase the risk of hepatotoxicity. Niacin has been associated with cases of liver toxicity, especially when used in pharmacologic doses ( 4863 , 11689 , 11691 , 25929 , 25930 , 25931 , 113553 ). Sustained-release niacin preparations appear to be associated with a higher risk of hepatotoxicity than immediate-release niacin ( 11691 , 25930 , 25931 , 93342 , 113553 ). more HMG-CoA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS (\"Statins\") Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, concomitant use of niacin and statins might increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis in some patients. Some case reports have raised concerns that niacin might increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when combined with statins ( 14508 , 25918 ). However, a significantly increased risk of myopathy has not been demonstrated in clinical trials, including those using an FDA-approved combination of lovastatin and niacin (Advicor) ( 7388 , 11689 , 12033 , 14509 ). more PROBENECID (Benemid) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence C (Expert opinion) Theoretically, niacin might antagonize the therapeutic effects of uricosurics such as probenecid. Large doses of niacin reduce urinary excretion of uric acid, potentially causing hyperuricemia ( 4863 , 12033 ). Doses of uricosurics such as probenecid might need to be increased to maintain control of gout in patients who start taking niacin ( 4458 ). People who have frequent attacks of gout despite uricosuric therapy should avoid niacin ( 4863 ). more SULFINPYRAZONE (Anturane) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence C (Expert opinion) Theoretically, niacin might antagonize the therapeutic effects of uricosurics such as sulfinpyrazone. Large doses of niacin reduce urinary excretion of uric acid, potentially causing hyperuricemia ( 4863 , 12033 ). Doses of uricosurics such as sulfinpyrazone might need to be increased to maintain control of gout in patients who start taking niacin ( 4458 ). People who have frequent attacks of gout despite uricosuric therapy should avoid niacin ( 4863 ). more THYROID HORMONE Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, niacin might antagonize the therapeutic effects of thyroid hormones. Clinical research and case reports suggests that taking niacin can reduce serum levels of thyroxine-binding globulin by up to 25% and moderately reduce levels of thyroxine (T4) ( 25916 , 25925 , 25926 , 25928 ). Patients taking thyroid hormone for hypothyroidism might need dose adjustments when using niacin. more TRANSDERMAL NICOTINE (Nicoderm) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use of niacin and transdermal nicotine might increase the risk of flushing and dizziness. Niacin and nicotine can both cause flushing and dizziness ( 496 , 96211 ). more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) There is limited evidence that niacin may increase the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. In a case report, a patient on warfarin developed an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 3.9 after taking niacin for two weeks. The patient's INR was previously stable, ranging between 2 and 3 in recent months, and no other medication changes were identified. The elevated INR returned to therapeutic range within 4 days following the discontinuation of niacin ( 116762 ). more",
  "mechanism_text": "General Vitamin B3 includes niacin (nicotinic acid) and niacinamide (nicotinamide) ( 6243 ). Niacin is converted to niacinamide when ingested in amounts that do not exceed physiological requirements. When used in physiological amounts, the effects of niacin and niacinamide are indistinguishable. Niacin is water-soluble and well-absorbed when taken orally ( 505 , 6243 , 11694 ). Dietary sources include meats, beans, cereal grains, fish, and various niacin-fortified foods. In addition, some dietary tryptophan is converted to niacin in the body. Consumption of tryptophan 60 mg equals 1 mg of niacin or one niacin equivalent ( 2677 , 6243 ). Niacin is a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). These coenzymes are essential for oxidation-reduction reactions, ATP synthesis, and ADP-ribose transfer reactions ( 2677 ). Antibacterial effects Evidence from animal research and preliminary clinical research suggests that niacin can prevent fluid loss in patients with cholera by reversing cholera toxin-induced intestinal secretion ( 4868 , 26119 ). Cardiovascular effects Some research suggests niacin has cardioprotective effects while other research suggests the opposite. In patients with hyperlipidemia or peripheral arterial disease, niacin reduces fibrinogen concentrations in plasma and possibly stimulates fibrinolysis ( 4871 , 8547 ). Evidence from animal research suggests that niacin helps preserve the myocardium following cardiac arrest and reperfusion by inhibiting beta-oxidation during preischemia and reperfusion, preventing the degradation of membrane phospholipids, reducing free fatty acid accumulation, and stimulating glycolysis ( 26120 ). Laboratory research suggests that niacin inhibits the formation of some cellular mediators in platelets, and increasing the production of others, resulting in an inhibition in platelet aggregation ( 26121 ). Increased production of some of these mediators plays a role in the visual flushing that occurs with niacin-induced vasodilation ( 6243 ). Despite the potential effects of niacin on vasodilation, any cardiovascular benefits of niacin do not appear to be related to improved endothelial or vascular function in patients with coronary artery disease or metabolic syndrome ( 93351 , 93353 ). Additionally, metabolomics analysis of blood from adults at high cardiovascular risk who had participated in observational studies conducted in Europe and the United States suggests that higher levels of circulating niacin terminal metabolites are associated with greater risk of major adverse cardiovascular events independent of traditional risk factors. Additionally, laboratory research on these identified metabolites shows that, at physiological levels, they elicit expression of vascular adhesion molecule 1 on human vascular endothelial cells and enhanced leukocyte adherence to vascular endothelium ( 113554 ). Central nervous system (CNS) effects There is interest in using niacin for Parkinson disease. Parkinson disease itself, as well as treatment with levodopa, are associated with low plasma levels of niacin ( 107943 , 107944 ). Preliminary clinical research in adults with Parkinson disease shows that taking slow-release niacin 250 mg orally daily for 12 months increases niacin plasma levels; however, there is no association between niacin levels and changes in motor scores ( 107944 ). In addition, clinical research shows conflicting effects of supplemental niacin on Parkinson disease symptoms ( 107943 , 107944 ). Endocrine effects Niacin can impair glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, probably by causing or aggravating insulin resistance ( 4863 , 11692 ). The effects of niacin on triglyceride synthesis may also increase hepatic output of glucose by enhancing fatty acid utilization in the liver at the expense of glucose ( 4860 , 11693 , 26127 ). Hypolipemic effects Niacin 1 gram daily or more can decrease total cholesterol by 8% to 21%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 8% to 25%, lipoprotein(a) by 23%, and triglycerides by 20% to 50%, as well as increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations by 15% to 35% ( 8545 , 96213 ). By binding to a G-protein-coupled receptor on adipocytes, niacin inhibits free fatty acid release from adipose tissue and inhibits cyclic AMP accumulation, which controls the activity of triglyceride lipase and hence lipolysis ( 26127 ). It also decreases the rate of liver synthesis of LDL and VLDL and increases the rate of chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma secondary to increased lipoprotein lipase activity ( 6243 ). Also, clinical research shows that niacin can reduce the number of VLDL particles, particularly the larger VLDL particles; increase the number of large but not small HDL particles; decrease the number of smaller, denser LDL particles; and increase the number of larger LDL particles ( 26123 , 26124 ). In vitro research suggests that niacin increases HDL and apolipoprotein (apo) A-1 levels by reducing the uptake of HDL and apoA-1-containing HDL particles by liver cells, without affecting the removal of cholesterol ester-containing HDL particles ( 26122 ). The liver enzyme diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) plays a key role in the esterification of fatty acids to form triglycerides ( 26126 ). Evidence from in vitro research suggests that niacin reduces the synthesis of triglycerides by inhibiting the activity of DGAT2 ( 26125 ). Niacin deficiency Niacin deficiency causes pellagra, a condition characterized by dermatitis, diarrhea and dementia ( 2677 , 6243 ). Pellagra was common in the early twentieth century, but niacin-fortified foods have virtually eliminated this disease in the West. It can be seen in patients with poor diet, chronic alcoholism, carcinoid tumors that decrease endogenous niacin production, and Hartnup disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that interferes with tryptophan absorption ( 4850 , 6243 ). Conditions that increase niacin requirements, such as hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, pregnancy, and lactation, can sometimes result in deficiency, but this is rare ( 4969 ). Some researchers think that sleep deprivation-induced dermatitis might be caused by niacin depletion because of similarities between this condition and pellagra ( 1350 ).",

Niacin impairs glucose tolerance in a dose-dependent manner, probably by causing or aggravating insulin resistance and increasing hepatic production of glucose ( 4860 , 4863 , 11692 , 11693 ). In diabetes patients, niacin 4.5 grams daily for 5 weeks can increase plasma glucose by an average of 16% and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 21% ( 4860 ). However, lower doses of 1.5 grams dai"
