  "overview_text": "Taurine is often referred to as a non-essential amino acid, but it is actually an amino sulfonic acid. It is present in normal diets, with the highest levels found in meat, seafood, and eggs. Taurine can also be synthesized through oxidation and decarboxylation of cysteine in the liver. Amounts supplied by a typical Western diet range from 40-400 mg daily. Taurine is also a common ingredient in energy drinks.",
  "effectiveness_text": "Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Congestive heart failure (CHF). Oral taurine may improve left ventricular function, heart failure-related symptoms, and exercise capacity in patients with CHF. A meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with heart failure shows that taking taurine 0.5-6 grams daily for up to 1 year modestly improves heart failure severity when compared with placebo ( 114794 , 114796 ). However, the validity of this study limited by high heterogeneity. In individual studies, taking taurine 2-6 grams in two or three divided doses daily for 6-8 weeks seems to improve left ventricular function ( 5248 , 5271 , 8221 ) and symptoms of heart failure ( 5271 , 5306 , 8221 ) when compared with placebo or coenzyme Q10 in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV. Also, taking taurine 500 mg three times daily for 2 weeks seems to improve exercise capacity when compared with placebo in patients with heart failure ( 77176 ). Some patients with severe heart failure rapidly improve from NYHA class IV to II after 4-8 weeks of treatment. Improvement seems to continue for as long as taurine treatment is continued, up to one year ( 5306 , 8217 , 8218 , 8221 ). more Hepatitis. Oral taurine may improve liver function in patients with acute or chronic hepatitis. Several small clinical trials show that taking taurine 1.5-4 grams daily for up to 3 months improves liver function in patients with acute and chronic hepatitis when compared with placebo ( 10454 , 77114 , 77147 ). more Possibly Ineffective Obesity. Oral taurine does not appear to improve body weight in adults who are obese or overweight. A meta-analysis of 12 small clinical trials shows that taurine supplementation does not reduce body weight or body mass index (BMI) when compared with placebo. The studies included in this analysis evaluated taurine doses of 0.5-6 grams daily for 15 days to 6 months. Most of the patient populations evaluated in the included studies had liver or metabolic disorders; three studies specifically evaluated overweight or obese adults ( 104166 ). Additionally, a more recent clinical trial in a small group of females with obesity shows that taking taurine 1 gram three times daily along with a calorie-restricted diet for 8 weeks does not reduce body weight, BMI, or waist circumference when compared with calorie restriction alone ( 104167 ). In contrast, a very small study in adults with type 2 diabetes on antidiabetes medication shows that taking taurine 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces body mass, BMI, and body fat percentage when compared with control ( 112271 ). The validity of these effects is limited by the small sample size. more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Academic performance. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial to improve academic performance. A very small clinical study in college entrance examinees over age 19 shows that taking a jelly containing taurine 3 grams daily for 14 days does not improve academic achievement when compared with baseline or placebo ( 110579 ). Due to its small size, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Although there has been interest in using oral taurine for AMD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of taurine for this purpose. Androgenic alopecia. Oral taurine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with androgenic alopecia or telogen effluvium shows that taking a combination product containing taurine, cysteine, methionine, iron, selenium, and hydrolyzed collagen (GFM Oral, Cantabria Labs) along with conventional therapy, consisting primarily of finasteride or minoxidil, daily for 12 weeks improves hair loss when compared with conventional therapy alone ( 111636 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to taurine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Athletic performance. Research on the use of taurine for improving endurance or power output is limited and conflicting; however, it may improve performance by a small amount in some athletes. Research is conflicting on the effects of taurine on athletic performance. Several clinical studies in trained and untrained athletes show that taking taurine 1-6 grams as a single dose before endurance exercise, or 3 grams daily for 8 weeks after endurance exercise, does not improve endurance or aerobic capacity when compared with placebo ( 77159 , 77203 , 95613 , 98334 ). However, a meta-analysis of 7 small clinical trials shows that taking taurine 1-6 grams daily for up to 2 weeks slightly improves endurance when compared with control. Also, preliminary studies in male cyclists, recreationally active males, Olympic-level athletes, and female athletes habituated to caffeine show that taking taurine 50 mg/kg or 1-6 grams one time 1.5-2 hours prior to a cycling test increases the time to exhaustion and peak, mean, and minimum power output but does not improve perceived exertion, fatigue index, heart rate, or anaerobic capacity when compared with placebo ( 101475 , 103211 , 112265 , 112269 ). The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear; the meta-analysis did not identify a dose or duration-related benefit. One small clinical trial shows that taking taurine 40 mg/kg improves muscle power in caffeine-deprived athletes who regularly use caffeine, but actually seems to worsen muscle power in athletes who do not regularly use caffeine ( 98335 ). Overall, it is not clear which population is most likely to benefit from taurine use ( 98337 , 98338 ). Study results are mixed when taurine has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. One small study shows that taking a specific product containing taurine and caffeine (AdvoCare Spark) does not improve sprint performance in college athletes when compared with placebo ( 77195 ). However, other small studies of cyclists and boxers suggest that taking taurine in combination with a variety of other ingredients including B vitamins, caffeine, and glucuronolactone (Red Bull Energy Drink) or ginseng, kudzu, and soybean, may improve measures such as endurance, power, balance, or agility ( 37815 , 57945 , 110577 , 112269 ). It is unclear if the benefits seen in these studies are due to taurine, other ingredients, or the combinations. more Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although there has been interest in using oral taurine for ADHD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of taurine for this purpose. Autism spectrum disorder. Although there has been interest in using oral taurine for autism spectrum disorder, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of taurine for this purpose. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with CINV. One small clinical trial in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving 6 months of chemotherapy shows that taking taurine (pure powder, Aviforme) 1000 mg twice daily, starting 6 hours after receiving chemotherapeutic agents, significantly improves CINV in 87.5% of patients. Other symptoms, such as reduced appetite and smell and taste impairment, are also improved in some patients ( 91512 ). more Chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for preventing or treating chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. One small clinical trial in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving 6 months of chemotherapy shows that taking taurine (pure powder, Aviforme) 1000 mg twice daily reduces plasma creatinine, urea, bilirubin, and liver enzymes after 4 months when compared with placebo. This suggests a protective effect against chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. A reduction in overall fatigue is also observed ( 95616 ). more Cirrhosis. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with cirrhosis. One small, uncontrolled clinical study in patients with cirrhosis shows that taking taurine 1 gram three times daily for 4 weeks reduces the severity and frequency of muscle cramps when compared to baseline ( 104165 ). Another small clinical trial in patients with cirrhosis shows that taking taurine 6 grams daily for 4 weeks reduces portal hypertension by 12%, compared with a 2% increase in the placebo group ( 98336 ). However, it is unclear if this is associated with a reduced risk for complications such as variceal bleeding and ascites. more Cognitive function. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for improving cognitive function; however, taking an energy drink (Red Bull Energy Drink) containing taurine and other ingredients may modestly improve some measures of cognitive function. Levels of taurine decrease with age, but supplementation does not seem to have neuroprotective effects or cognitive benefits in the elderly ( 101471 , 110574 , 110578 ). In one small crossover study, taurine alone did not reduce errors in sleep-deprived individuals when compared with placebo ( 38154 ). However, taurine taken as part of an energy drink formulation containing taurine, caffeine, glucuronolactone, and B vitamins (Red Bull Energy Drink) improves focused and sustained attention, wakefulness, verbal reasoning, driving ability and quality, and reaction speed when compared with placebo ( 9899 , 38117 , 77088 , 77202 ). Preliminary clinical research in young adults also shows that consuming the Red Bull Energy Drink might improve attention and verbal reasoning, but does not seem to improve memory, when compared with placebo ( 9899 , 77088 ). more Critical illness (trauma). It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with critical illness. A meta-analysis of small clinical trials including adults in the intensive care unit (ICU) shows that receiving enteral nutrition enhanced with taurine for 5-14 days does not reduce mortality or shorten ICU length of stay when compared with control. Taurine was added to enteral nutrition at doses of 30-50 mg/kg or 10 mg total daily ( 114795 ). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Cystic fibrosis. Oral taurine may reduce steatorrhea in children with cystic fibrosis, but it does not seem to improve other measures of nutritional status. Some small clinical studies in children with cystic fibrosis show that taking taurine 30-40 mg/kg daily for 7 days to 6 months might be useful as adjunctive therapy to reduce steatorrhea when compared with baseline or placebo ( 10455 , 77227 , 77231 ). However, it does not seem to improve growth, lung function, muscle protein breakdown, or other symptoms of cystic fibrosis (77224 ,77228). Also, adding taurine 500-1500 mg daily to treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid for up to one year does not improve liver function tests, fat absorption, or nutritional status in patients with cystic fibrosis and associated liver disease when compared with ursodeoxycholic acid alone ( 77246 , 77256 ). more Delirium. It is unclear if oral taurine prevents delirium in patients in the intensive care unit. A large clinical study of hospitalized adults in Iran who underwent liver transplantation shows that taking a specific taurine powder product (100% Taurine Amino Acid, MyProtein) 2 grams daily for 30 days post-transplant reduces the risk of delirium by 73% when compared with placebo. These results also suggest that for every four patients treated with taurine over placebo, one additional case of delirium is prevented. Patients who took taurine also had less time on the ventilator and shorter intensive care and hospital stays ( 110575 ). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to taurine or other factors since ventilator time and intensive care length of stay are risk factors for delirium. more Diabetes. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with diabetes. Plasma levels of taurine are reported to be lower in patients with diabetes than in healthy controls ( 101473 ). However, clinical research evaluating taurine for glycemic control is mixed ( 77074 , 103212 ). One small clinical trial in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking taurine 1 gram three times daily for 8 weeks reduces blood glucose, insulin resistance, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo ( 103212 ). Although there was no improvement in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), the study duration was not long enough to detect a meaningful reduction in HbA1c. Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking taurine 1-1.5 grams twice daily for 2-4 months does not affect fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, or insulin but may improve measures of insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo ( 77074 , 112271 ). However, taking taurine while following an exercise program 3 times weekly does appear to reduce fasting blood sugar and HbA1c when compared with exercise plus placebo ( 112271 ). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear; however, all the included studies were small and potentially inadequately powered to detect a difference in outcomes. A meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with diabetes and other metabolic disorders shows that taking taurine 0.5-6 grams orally daily for up to 1 year reduces fasting blood glucose by approximately 6 mg/mL, when compared with placebo ( 114796 ). However, many of the studies included patients who did not have diabetes. The validity of this study is also limited by high heterogeneity. more Epilepsy. Although there has been interest in using oral taurine for epilepsy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of taurine for this condition. Erectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with erectile dysfunction. An open-label clinical study in adults with mild-to-moderate ED shows that taking a specific combination supplement (Icarifil, Anvest Health S.p.A) containing taurine 50 mg, panax ginseng , L-carnitine, L-citrulline, tribulus, and other ingredients orally daily for 3 months improves patient-reported erectile function when compared to baseline. Additionally, taking the supplement with tadalafil improves some, but not all, patient-reported assessments of erectile function when compared with taking tadalafil alone ( 114989 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to taurine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Exercise-induced muscle soreness. Small clinical studies suggest that oral taurine may modestly improve exercise-induced muscle soreness. One small clinical trial in healthy, untrained adults shows that taking taurine 2 grams in combination with branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) three times daily for 2 weeks reduces subjective muscle soreness by 37% when compared with placebo ( 77212 ). Another small clinical trial in young, untrained males shows that taking taurine (Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., LTD.) 2 grams three times daily after meals before exercise, and continuing for three days after exercise, reduces delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), but not creatine kinase levels, when compared with placebo ( 91513 ). more Fatigue. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for improving fatigue. One small clinical trial shows that taurine seems to reduce fatigue when taken alone, but increases fatigue when taken in combination with caffeine ( 77202 ). However, an observational study in young adults has found that subjective scores for physical and mental fatigue do not seem to correlate with dietary taurine intake ( 101472 ). One small clinical trial shows that drinking 500 mL of an energy drink providing taurine 1 gram plus other ingredients including caffeine and B vitamins decreases measures of driving-related fatigue in a driving simulation when compared with placebo ( 91075 ). more Helicobacter pylori. It is unclear if oral taurine can aid in the eradication of helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). One clinical trial shows that taking taurine 500 mg twice daily in combination with conventional treatment for 6 weeks increases H. pylori eradication and shortens duodenal ulcer scarring time in patients with confirmed H. pylori infection when compared with conventional treatment alone ( 77145 ). more Hyperlipidemia. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for lowering lipid levels. A meta-analysis of 12 small clinical trials in adults with various liver or metabolic disorders, but without a specific diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, shows that taurine supplementation reduces total cholesterol by 11 mg/dL and triglycerides by 13 mg/dL, but does not seem to improve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo. The studies included in this analysis evaluated doses of 0.5-6 grams daily for 15 days to 6 months ( 104166 ). Another meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with various cardiovascular and metabolic disorders shows that taking taurine 0.5-6 grams orally daily for up to 1 year reduces triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by approximately 18 mg/dL and 6 mg/dL, respectively, when compared with placebo. Taking taurine did not affect high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ( 114796 ). However, many of the studies included patients who did not have hyperlipidemia. The validity of this study is also limited by high heterogeneity. The benefits of taurine in adults with hyperlipidemia are unclear. The effect of taurine has also been investigated in combination with exercise. A very small study in adults with type 2 diabetes on antidiabetes medication shows that taking taurine 500 mg twice daily while participating in an exercise program 3 times weekly for 8 weeks reduces triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol when compared with exercise plus placebo ( 112271 ). more Hypertension. Oral taurine may modestly reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension; however, the long-term antihypertensive effects of taurine are unclear. One clinical study in patients with elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension shows that taking taurine 1.6 grams daily for 12 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 3 mmHg when compared with placebo. The benefit is seen after 8 weeks of continued supplementation ( 95614 ). A small clinical trial in patients with stage 2 hypertension (previously classified as borderline hypertension) shows that taking taurine 6 grams daily for 7 days reduces both SBP and DBP when compared to baseline ( 77229 ). The long-term effects of taurine on blood pressure are unclear. A meta-analysis of 12 small clinical trials in adults with various liver or metabolic disorders, but without a specific hypertension diagnosis, shows that taurine supplementation reduces SBP by 5 mmHg and DBP by 3 mmHg when compared with placebo. The studies included in this analysis evaluated doses of 0.5-6 grams daily for 15 days to 6 months ( 104166 ). Two meta-analyses of clinical trials in patients with cardiovascular and other metabolic disorders show that taking taurine 0.5-6 grams orally daily for up to 1 year reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by approximately 4 mmHg and 2 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo ( 114794 , 114796 ). However, many of the studies included patients who did not have hypertension. The validity of this study is also limited by high heterogeneity. Taurine is commonly found in energy drinks, and its effect on blood pressure when used in combination with other ingredients in the form of an energy drink has been evaluated. A small observational study in young adults suggests that drinking a specific combination product containing taurine 100 mg, caffeine, and group B vitamins (Redbull Energy Drink) reduces heart rate but does not change SBP or DBP when compared to baseline ( 112266 ). However, another small observational study in young healthy adults suggests that drinking a specific combination product containing taurine 2000 mg, caffeine, ginseng, glucuronolactone, inositol, guarana, L-carnitine, and B vitamins (Monster Energy Drink) increases both SBP and DBP by about 16 mmHg and raises heart rate by 17 beats per minute 15 minutes after consumption when compared to baseline. However, 90 minutes after consumption only DBP and heart rate remain elevated ( 112268 ). In both studies, the validity of the effects is limited by a lack of a comparator group. Additionally, it is unclear if the effects are due to taurine, other ingredients, or the combination. more Infant development. Higher maternal intake of taurine from the diet may be linked to increased newborn length and weight; however, feeding taurine-containing formula to newborns does not appear to improve infant development. One observational study has found a positive correlation between maternal dietary taurine intake and newborn length. In pregnant patients with high taurine intake (>120 mg/day), neonatal birth weight and length were significantly higher when compared with groups with lower taurine intake ( 101474 ). However, clinical research shows that administering infant formula containing taurine 45 mg/L for up to 12 weeks does not affect weight, length, head circumference, or behavior in preterm and full-term infants when compared with formula without taurine ( 77119 , 77216 , 77218 , 77239 , 77260 ). more Iron deficiency anemia. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with iron deficiency anemia. One small clinical trial in females with iron deficiency anemia shows that taking taurine 1000 mg plus ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily for 20 weeks improves hemoglobin concentrations, red blood cell counts, and serum ferritin levels when compared with ferrous sulfate plus placebo ( 77070 ). more Muscular dystrophy. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with muscular dystrophy. One very small crossover trial in patients with muscular dystrophy shows that taking taurine 100-150 mg/kg for 6 months improves the ability to relax muscles after voluntary use when compared with placebo ( 77235 ). more Physical performance. It is unclear if oral taurine improves physical performance in older adults. A small study in elderly females living in a care facility shows that taking taurine powder 1.5 grams daily for 14 weeks in addition to standardized exercise training may modestly improve some measures of physical fitness (i.e. agility, endurance) when compared to baseline. These measures were not improved in patients who took taurine but did not participate in exercise training or who participated in exercise training but did not take taurine ( 110574 ). The validity of these findings is limited by lack of randomization, blinding, and statistical comparison between groups. more Postoperative recovery. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial for improving postoperative recovery. One small clinical trial in patients recovering from surgery after a hip fracture shows that taking taurine 6 grams daily for 7 days after surgery does not improve morbidity and mortality outcomes after 1 year when compared with placebo ( 95615 ). more Psychosis. It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with psychosis. One small clinical trial in adults up to 25 years of age with first-episode psychosis shows that taking taurine 4 grams daily for 12 weeks in combination with prescribed antipsychotics reduces positive psychotic symptoms, but not negative or cognitive symptoms, when compared with placebo ( 95612 ). more Sleep deprivation. Oral taurine has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination product containing taurine, caffeine, glucuronolactone, and B vitamins (Red Bull Energy Drink) reduces lane drifting and sleepiness and improves driving quality and reaction time during a car-driving simulator exercise in sleep-deprived individuals when compared with placebo ( 38117 , 77066 ). Other preliminary clinical research in sleep-deprived surgical trainees shows that taking taurine 2 grams in addition to caffeine 150 mg improves reaction time during performance of simulated laparoscopic surgery when compared with placebo, although error-making is not reduced ( 38154 ). more Tourette syndrome. Oral taurine may improve tic severity in children with Tourette syndrome who are taking tiapride at a dose of 300 mg or less. Taurine may not be effective in children taking higher doses of tiapride. One clinical trial in children 6-16 years of age with Tourette syndrome or other tic disorders shows that taking taurine along with tiapride reduces the severity of tics when compared with tiapride alone. For every 6 children taking taurine, one additional child saw a 60% or greater reduction in tic severity as measured on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale when compared with placebo. However, taurine did not improve tic severity in children taking tiapride at a dose greater than 300 mg daily ( 103210 ). Taurine was taken in age-dependent doses of 2.4 grams daily in those 6-8 years, 3.6 grams daily in those 9-13 years, and 4.8 grams daily in those 14-16 years. more Traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is unclear if oral taurine is beneficial in patients with a TBI. A small clinical study of adults in Iran receiving treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) following TBI shows that adding a specific taurine powder product (Nutricost) 30 mg/kg/day up to 3 grams daily to enteral nutrition for 14 days may modestly improve disease severity scores, but does not reduce days on the ventilator, ICU length of stay, or mortality at 30 days when compared with usual enteral nutrition ( 110573 ). Due to its small size, this study may have been underpowered to detect differences between groups. more More evidence is needed to rate taurine for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Likely Safe when used in amounts found in foods. Typical daily intakes for adults range from 40-400 mg ( 101471 ). Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts. Taurine 2-4 grams daily in two or three divided doses has been used safely in studies lasting up to 3 months ( 5248 , 5271 , 8217 , 8221 , 10454 , 77147 , 95612 , 98337 , 104165 , 104167 ). Higher doses of taurine 6 grams daily have been used safely in studies lasting up to 4 weeks ( 98336 , 98337 ). A risk assessment of orally administered taurine has identified an Observed Safe Level (OSL) of up to 3 grams daily for healthy adults ( 31996 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used in amounts found in foods. CHILDREN: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts. Taurine 2.4-4.8 grams daily in three divided doses has been safely used in children 6-16 years of age for up to 12 weeks ( 103210 ). PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Likely Safe when used in amounts found in foods. There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of taurine when used in medicinal amounts during pregnancy and lactation; avoid using.",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: Taurine has most often been used in doses of 1.5-6 grams daily, taken in divided doses. The duration of therapy depends on the condition being treated. Doses of up to 6 grams daily have been used for up to one year. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Concomitant use of taurine supplements or taurine-containing energy drinks with alcohol should be avoided if possible. Some research suggests that consuming taurine might increase alcohol consumption, potentially increasing the risk for alcohol poisoning ( 101471 ). Children Oral: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Standardization & Formulation Energy drinks typically contain taurine 750-1000 mg per serving ( 101471 ). Pediatric amino acid formulations such as Aminosyn-PF and Trophamine contain taurine 70 mg/100mL and 25 mg/100mL respectively ( 77083 ).",

  "mechanism_text": "General Taurine is a non-essential amino acid also known as 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. It is found in high levels in protein-rich foods, such as meat, fish, and eggs, as well as in breast milk. Taurine is normally synthesized in the human body in adequate amounts by oxidation and decarboxylation of cysteine ( 5280 , 101473 ). Taurine is important in several metabolic processes in the body, including stabilizing cell membranes in electrically active tissues, such as the brain and heart, and supporting proliferation of neural progenitor cells and synapse formation in the brain. It is found in high concentrations in the developing brain, and also in the adult hippocampus, cerebellum, and hypothalamus ( 101471 ). Taurine also has functions in the gallbladder, eyes, and blood vessels, and may have some antioxidant and detoxifying properties. Taurine is also a vasorelaxant in the retina ( 77106 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Taurine has been shown to ameliorate inflammation in vitro and in vivo ( 77090 , 103213 ). In cellular research, taurine inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 ( 77155 ). A similar reduction in IL-6 has been seen clinically ( 77187 ), although conflicting research exists ( 103209 , 110576 ). In humans, taurine down-regulates inflammatory mediators, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and malondialdehyde (MDA), protecting and regenerating damaged tissue ( 77099 , 103209 , 110576 ). However, research related to the effect of taurine on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha has mixed results ( 103209 , 110576 ). Antiallergy effects In a mouse model of allergic rhinitis, taurine ameliorated the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis, likely through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects ( 103213 ). Antidiabetic effects In animal research, intraperitoneal administration of taurine dose-dependently attenuated streptozotocin-induced elevations in blood glucose ( 77162 ). In humans, plasma taurine levels have been found to be lower in people with type 2 diabetes than in controls, and they are lowest in those with type 2 diabetes who also have neuropathy ( 101473 ). Taurine is thought to act on beta cell secretion and to interfere with insulin signaling pathways. In animals it improves glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia ( 101473 ). Antiemetic effects The inhibitory effect of taurine on nausea and vomiting may result from its neuroprotective or inhibitory neurotransmitter actions. At the presynaptic site, taurine may inhibit voltage gated calcium channels and/or open the chloride channels and suppress the release of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate. It may also increase K+ efflux to decrease the postsynaptic depolarization. Taurine may also act as an inhibitory neurotransmitter to lead to a reduction of nausea and vomiting ( 91512 ). Taurine displays inhibitory activity in the olfactory bulb by decreasing excitability and modulating release of GABA. GABA acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in taste buds, and taurine acts as an agonist for GABA receptors. Therefore, taurine may play a role in decreasing taste sensation and improving hypergeusia. Taurine may also help reduce bitter tastes ( 91512 ). Antiepileptic effects Possible mechanisms for an antiepileptic effect of taurine include modulation of calcium homeostasis ( 77060 , 77261 ), prevention of glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity ( 77171 ), establishing equilibrium between inhibitory and excitatory brain processes ( 77144 ), or activating GABA-A receptors ( 77063 , 77072 , 77219 ). The results of preliminary studies using taurine in humans with epilepsy are mixed, which could be due to variable penetration of taurine into the brain ( 77059 , 77232 , 77240 , 77243 , 77252 ). Antihypertensive effects An inverse correlation between plasma taurine levels and systolic blood pressure has been reported ( 101473 ). Taurine inhibits sympathetic nervous system activity, dilates blood vessels, and suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( 77229 , 101473 ). In laboratory studies, taurine significantly upregulates expression of cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-lyase in human mesenteric arteries. This increases production of hydrogen sulfide, resulting in vascular relaxation via inhibition of calcium influx ( 95614 ). Antineoplastic effect In cellular research, taurine inhibited doxorubicin efflux from M5076 tumor cells and decreased the weight of tumors by 40% compared to doxorubicin alone ( 77148 ). Antioxidant effects In preliminary research in vitro, taurine has demonstrated both direct and indirect antioxidant activity, via the scavenging of reactive oxygen species and the stabilization of membrane permeability, respectively ( 77112 , 77118 ). In cancer cells, taurine has been shown to scavenge oxidant and cytotoxic agents, thus protecting against carcinogenesis ( 77191 ). Various clinical studies also suggest that taurine has antioxidant effects ( 77107 , 77192 , 103209 ). In one observational study, plasma taurine levels have been linked to improvements in oxidative stress makers in people taking hypolipidemic agents, possibly due to reduced superoxide anion production at the respiratory chain level ( 77192 ). In another human study, lipoperoxidation following coronary artery bypass grafting was reduced by taurine, indicating that it may be a free-radical scavenger ( 77107 ). In patients with type 2 diabetes, taurine 1000 mg three times daily for 8 weeks increased the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase when compared with placebo ( 103209 ). Antitoxin effects In preclinical research, taurine prevents methamphetamine-induced developmental angiogenesis defects, possibly due to its antioxidant effects ( 77198 ). Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, cytoprotective, osmoregulatory, and membrane stabilizing effects of taurine may contribute to its protective effects against toxicity of drugs and other compounds ( 77205 ). Antiulcer effects In individuals with Helicobacter pylori-induced duodenal ulcers, adjunct taurine (Dibicor) contributes to eradication of H. pylori, shortening of duodenal scarring time, improvement in KI-67, BCL-2 expression, and stimulation of apoptotic activity of epitheliocytes compared with conventional omeprazole and antibiotic treatment alone ( 77145 ). Athletic performance enhancement effects Some evidence from animal research suggests that the quantity of taurine in the muscle tissue may impact exercise performance. The mechanism for this activity may involve reduction of oxidative stress, increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the muscle interstitial space, and the stabilization and hyperexcitement of the cell membrane. Additional research suggests that taurine may influence the amount of energy provided by the glycolytic pathway during high-intensity exercise, reducing blood lactate accumulation during exercise and improving anaerobic capacity ( 95613 ). Biliary effects Taurine seems to stimulate bile acid synthesis ( 3467 ). Cardiovascular effects Taurine has been explored as a potential preventative factor for various cardiovascular conditions ( 3467 ), including coronary heart disease ( 77146 , 77169 ), cardiac remodeling ( 77150 ), and ischemic disease ( 77111 , 77128 ), due in part to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, bile acid-conjugating, blood pressure-regulating, and intracellular calcium-modulating activities. Taurine might also lower blood pressure and might normalize excessive sympathetic nervous system activity that often occurs in people with hypertension and heart failure ( 3467 , 8219 , 8221 , 8222 ). It also has an inotropic effect on cardiac myocytes and increases stroke volume ( 101475 ). Additionally, taurine seems to modestly lower the heart rate in patients with cardiovascular or other metabolic disorders ( 114794 ). Decreased and increased heart rate and increased blood pressure have been reported following the co-administration of taurine and caffeine in human research ( 77088 , 112268 ). Decreased and increased heart rate and increased blood pressure have been reported following the co-administration of taurine and caffeine in human research ( 77088 , 112268 ). The concentration of taurine increases in the left ventricle of patients with CHF ( 9900 ). Preliminary studies also suggest taurine might have natriuretic and diuretic activity ( 3467 ). Despite evidence of taurine's possible cardioprotective effects, some conflicting evidence exists. One observational study in patients suffering from cardiac arrest has found that patients with serum taurine levels in the upper quartile have around 4-fold higher odds of in-hospital mortality when compared with patients with taurine levels in the lower three quartiles ( 103208 ). Another study in young healthy adults suggests that taurine taken as part of an energy drink impairs endothelial cell function, decreases velocities of carotid arteries, and reduces cardiac output but does not seem to impact electrocardiogram parameters ( 112268 ). In an animal model, heart perfusion with higher doses of taurine shortens cardiac repolarization, QT interval, and ventricular effective refractory periods, facilitating re-entry and leading to an increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. Researchers theorize that this mechanism may give insight into fatal outcomes secondary to intoxication with energy drinks reported in humans ( 112267 ). Effects in traumatic brain injury (TBI) Taurine levels increase in the brain in response to stress and it is released from swollen cells as normal volumes are re-established in people with TBI. Taurine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with TBI almost double, then return to baseline within 3 days ( 101471 ). GABA modulating effects Taurine stimulates action potentials in GABAergic neurons, specifically targeting GABA-A receptors ( 101471 ). It has been suggested that effects of taurine on GABA receptors may contribute to seizures occurring after consumption of taurine-containing energy drinks. Taurine may decrease expression of beta 2/3 subunits of GABA receptors, lowering the seizure threshold ( 77196 ). Hormonal effects In preliminary human research, a supplement containing taurine and other ingredients taken before exercise increased the post-exercise serum concentration of growth hormone ( 46700 , 77122 ). Hypersensitivity Taurine can be metabolized to sulfites, acetaldehyde, and aminoacetaldehyde which may cause hypersensitivity-type reactions ( 91514 ). Lipid metabolism effects In healthy people, taurine seems to reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein, but increases very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol ( 77061 , 77114 , 77258 ). Studies have shown both increases and decreases in serum triglycerides ( 77076 , 77114 , 77258 ). These effects may be mediated by an effect of taurine on lipoprotein lipase. In people with liver injury, taurine decreases total cholesterol and triglycerides ( 77114 ). Muscle effects Taurine has been reported to decrease oxidative stress. It is possible that it prevents increases in carbonyl protein and lipoperoxide levels which contribute to muscle soreness ( 91513 ). Thermoregulatory effects In tests where cycling in a hot environment (35°C, 40% relative humidity) is continued to exhaustion, taurine slows the rise in core temperature and increases sweating rate at the end of the test by about 13%. Its vasodilatory effects may be contributing to heat dissipation, and it also seems to have central effects. It acts as an agonist at GABA-A receptors in the hypothalamus, affecting thermoregulation ( 101475 ).",
