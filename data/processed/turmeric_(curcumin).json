  "overview_text": "Turmeric is a spice commonly used in Asian food that is derived from the root of the turmeric plant. The plant is a perennial herb and a member of the Zingiberaceae (ginger) family, and is cultivated in India and Southeast Asia. It is used in traditional Chinese and Indian medicine, and in Indian religious ceremonies (11140). Curcumin is the yellow-colored primary active constituent derived from turmeric. This turmeric constituent is commonly used to color foods and cosmetics.",
  "effectiveness_text": "Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Allergic rhinitis (hay fever). Oral turmeric seems to improve symptoms in people with allergic rhinitis. A large clinical study in people with allergic rhinitis shows that taking a specific curcumin product (Organika Health Products) 500 mg daily for 2 months reduces nasal symptoms, including sneezing, itching, runny nose, and congestion, when compared with placebo ( 96138 ). more Depression. Most research shows that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, when used at doses of at least 1 gram daily for at least 6 weeks improves symptoms of depression when taken alone or in combination with antidepressant medications. Curcumin appears to be most beneficial for depression in middle aged patients compared to older patients, when taken for at least 6 weeks, and when used at a dose of at least 1 gram daily. In adults with major depressive disorder, a meta-analysis of data from 6 clinical studies, as well as individual studies not included in this analysis, show that taking curcumin 1 gram daily along with an antidepressant moderately improves depression symptoms when compared with placebo ( 96131 , 96139 ). Another meta-analysis of 10 studies shows symptom reductions in patients with major depression when combined with conventional antidepressants, but not when used alone in patients with milder depressive symptoms. However, the quality of the evidence is low ( 104971 ). Additionally, a large clinical study in adults with mild-moderate symptoms of depression shows that taking curcumin 750 mg twice daily for 12 months modestly reduces depression symptoms when compared with placebo ( 114898 ). When used alone, one clinical study shows that curcumin 1 gram daily for 6 weeks may be similarly effective to fluoxetine 20 mg daily. Taking both products together seems to be more effective than either product alone, increasing the response rate from 65% to 78% ( 89728 ). Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that curcumin extract at doses of 500-1000 mg daily is provisionally recommended for monotherapy or adjunctive use in mild to moderate depression ( 110318 ). more Dyspepsia. Oral turmeric may be modestly beneficial for some patients with dyspepsia. In patients with functional dyspepsia, small clinical studies show that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is similarly effective when compared with the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole. Clinical research shows that taking turmeric 500 mg four times daily for 7 days can relieve overall symptoms of dyspepsia in 64% more patients than taking placebo ( 11144 ). A small, unblinded clinical study in patients with a type of dyspepsia called postprandial distress syndrome shows that taking turmeric 250 mg or 500 mg orally three times daily after meals for 4 weeks is associated with reductions in symptom scores which are similar to those seen with simethicone 60 mg three times daily for 4 weeks. However, the recurrence rate upon stopping therapy was about 14% with simethicone, compared with 43% to 46% with turmeric ( 104963 ). In patients with functional dyspepsia, taking the constituent curcumin appears similarly effective when compared with omeprazole, but might not provide further symptom reduction in those also taking famotidine or omeprazole ( 106063 , 106801 , 111599 ). One small clinical study in Iran shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg daily in addition to famotidine 40 mg daily for 30 days is no more effective for reducing overall symptoms of dyspepsia, such as abdominal pain, heartburn, bloating, and nausea, when compared with famotidine alone ( 106063 ). Another small clinical study in Thailand shows that taking curcumin 500 mg four times daily for 4 weeks is similarly effective for reducing dyspepsia severity and improving satisfaction when compared with an unspecified dose of omeprazole and more effective when compared with placebo ( 106801 ). Similarly, a moderate-size clinical study in Thailand shows that taking curcumin 500 mg four times daily for 4 weeks is similarly effective for reducing dyspepsia severity when compared with omeprazole 20 mg daily. However, taking curcumin and omeprazole in combination did not provide further symptom reduction ( 111599 ). The validity of these results is limited by the high rate of study dropouts. more Hyperlipidemia. Research is conflicting on whether oral turmeric, curcumin, or curcuminoids can reduce serum lipids. Any improvement in lipids is likely to be small. Reasons for the conflicting findings may relate to turmeric formulation, duration of treatment, and/or the baseline cholesterol status of the included patients. Results from meta-analyses of clinical research show inconsistent and conflicting results. One large meta-analysis of over 50 clinical studies in healthy adults and those with a variety of conditions shows that supplementation with turmeric or curcumin 80-4000 mg daily for 4-24 weeks reduces total cholesterol by 4 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 5 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 7 mg/dL and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 2 mg/dL when compared with placebo ( 112119 ). Two other meta-analyses of 27 clinical studies agree that taking turmeric, curcumin, or curcuminoids moderately reduce triglyceride levels but suggest that turmeric does not improve total cholesterol when compared with placebo. However, the meta-analyses contradict one another on whether turmeric and its constituents reduce LDL cholesterol or increase HDL cholesterol. ( 96128 , 96135 ). Additionally, a third meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials shows that taking up to 2400 mg daily of curcumin or curcuminoids, from turmeric or isolated sources, for up to 12 weeks, does not significantly improve triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or total cholesterol ( 110220 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, seems to attenuate fat deposition and improve some metabolic parameters in adults with NAFLD. Clinical research shows that taking curcumin daily reduces NAFLD severity in 30% to 79% of patients, compared to 5% to 27.5% of patients receiving placebo. Curcumin also reduces the quantity of additional fat deposition in the liver to 0% to 4.5%, compared to 17.5% to 26% in those taking placebo. Most research shows that taking curcumin also reduces liver enzyme levels, body mass index (BMI), blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and total cholesterol when compared with placebo. Although some clinical research shows that taking curcumin improves levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that these lipid levels are not improved in patients with NAFLD, specifically ( 97430 , 97431 , 100258 , 102350 , 106062 , 107120 , 109279 , 111349 , 114901 ). However, another meta-analysis of 14 small, heterogeneous clinical studies in adults with NAFLD, that included some of these studies, shows that taking various doses and forms of turmeric or curcumin modestly reduces liver enzyme levels, improves measures of insulin resistance, reduces waist circumference, and improves LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels when compared with placebo ( 111348 ). A small clinical trial in patients with NAFLD given specific lifestyle recommendations shows that taking curcumin modestly reduces the frequency of metabolic syndrome and fatty liver but does not have beneficial effects on fatty liver-associated indices, adiposity, or the atherogenic index, when compared with placebo ( 109285 ). Findings for specific endpoints are mixed between individual studies and may depend on the dose and formulation of curcumin used or the duration of treatment. These studies have used various doses and formulations. In one study, 500 mg of a dispersion formulation equivalent to 70 mg of curcumin daily for 8 weeks was used ( 97430 ). Also, 250 mg once daily or 500 mg twice daily of a specific phytosomal formulation (Meriva, Indena) containing curcumin and soy phosphatidylcholine in a 1:2 ratio and standardized to an overall curcuminoid content of 20% was taken for 8 weeks ( 97431 , 106062 ). Another study used 1 gram of powdered turmeric rhizome taken three times daily with meals for 12 weeks ( 102350 ). One study used a curcumin-piperine complex (Curcumin C3 complex 500 mg plus Bioperine 5 mg) daily for 8 weeks ( 107120 ). One study used curcumin (Arjuna Natural Extract) 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks ( 109285 ). Despite positive results with curcumin in several small clinical studies of patients with NAFLD, there is some concern that curcumin might cause hepatotoxicity in rare cases, especially when highly bioavailable formulations are used in high doses ( 103633 ). There is also evidence that the risk for hepatotoxicity with curcumin may be increased in individuals with the HLAB*35:01 allele ( 109288 ). Curcumin-induced hepatotoxicity has not been reported in clinical trials of patients with NAFLD, and its potential mechanism is unclear. However, patients seeking to take curcumin for NAFLD should be advised to monitor for symptoms of hepatotoxicity, including abdominal pain, dark urine, fatigue, jaundice, nausea, and pruritus. more Oral mucositis. Oral curcumin or curcumin-containing mouthwash seem to reduce the development of severe oral mucositis, as well as reduce the severity and pain of oral mucositis, associated with cancer treatment. Clinical research in patients receiving radiotherapy following recent radical surgery for oral cancer shows that taking turmeric (BCM-95, Arjuna Natural Pvt. Ltd., India) during radiotherapy reduces the incidence of severe oral mucositis to 25% or 20% in those taking turmeric 500 mg two or three times daily, respectively, compared with 65% in those taking placebo. The incidences of severe oral pain, dysphagia, and dermatitis were also reduced by at least 50% ( 105398 ). A small clinical study in patients receiving chemotherapy with or without head and neck radiotherapy shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg twice daily for 7 weeks improves severity of oral mucositis at weeks 1, 4, and 7 and reduces pain at week 7 when compared with placebo. Effects were more pronounced in those with chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis than radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis ( 106800 ). In patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy, preliminary clinical research shows that swishing with 10 mL of turmeric solution (prepared by dissolving turmeric 400 mg in 80 mL of water) six times daily for 6 weeks delays mucositis and reduces the number of cases of intolerable mucositis by 49% when compared to swishing with 10 mL of povidone-iodine solution twice daily for 6 weeks ( 89726 ). Another small clinical study shows that swishing with 10 mL of nanoparticulate curcumin 0.1% mouthwash three times daily for 6 weeks is associated with a 50% lower risk of developing oral mucositis, and a delay of 2 weeks in the onset of mucositis, when compared with benzydamine 0.15% mouthwash ( 104969 ). A small clinical study in patients with mucositis due to head and neck radiotherapy shows that taking curcumin nanoparticles (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 40 mg daily or using 10 mL of a curcumin 0.1% mouthwash three times daily for up to 21 days improves scores related to pain, burning, ulceration, and erythema when compared with placebo. Results with either oral or topical curcumin were similar ( 111350 ). more Osteoarthritis. Some oral turmeric extracts and combination products containing turmeric seem to improve certain symptoms of knee osteoarthritis. However, it is unclear how turmeric compares to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Several meta-analyses of clinical studies show that turmeric extracts and/or curcuminoid products reduce knee pain and stiffness, improve physical function, and reduce the need for rescue medication when compared with placebo ( 104970 , 106792 , 109280 , 110222 ). However, a reduced effect was noted in patients with increasing age or body mass index ( 104790 ). The studies evaluated in these meta-analyses are heterogeneous, of low- to moderate-quality, and utilized a variety of products and/or dosing strategies ( 104970 , 106792 , 109280 , 110222 ). Small to moderate-sized clinical studies show that specific products (Meriva, Indena; Theracurmin, Theravalues Corp) containing curcumin 90-100 mg twice daily for up to 6 months, or specific turmeric extracts (Turmacin, Natural Remedies Pvt. Ltd.; Curcugen, DolCas Biotech, LLC) 500 mg twice daily for 6-12 weeks, reduce pain and analgesic use and improve functionality when compared with placebo ( 17953 , 80988 , 89721 , 97424 , 104148 , 107118 ). A specific turmeric extract (CuraMed, EuroPharma USA) 1500 mg daily for 12 weeks improves functionality, but not pain, when compared with placebo ( 96127 ). Also, a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina), 40 mg twice daily for 6 weeks, improves pain, stiffness, and physical activity scores and reduces intake of rescue acetaminophen by about 60% when compared with placebo ( 102349 ). However, not all turmeric products seem to be effective for improving symptoms of osteoarthritis. One small clinical study shows that taking a specific turmeric extract (B-Turmactive, PLAMECA S.A.) 500 mg daily for one week does not reduce knee pain when compared with placebo ( 104147 ). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that benefits are limited to bio-optimized forms of curcuminoids, and benefits related to pure extracts are lacking ( 110222 ). Turmeric has also been compared with conventional treatments for knee osteoarthritis in small meta-analyses, a network meta-analysis, and individual clinical studies. However, the evidence is mixed as to whether turmeric is as effective or more effective than NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen 400 mg taken 2-3 times daily, diclofenac 25-100 mg daily, or chondroprotective drugs ( 17952 , 89720 , 89722 , 106792 , 109280 , 110222 , 113607 ). A network meta-analysis comparing 6 interventions in adults with knee osteoarthritis suggests that curcumin monotherapy, curcumin with chondroprotective agents, or curcumin with NSAIDs improves scores related to pain, function, and stiffness while reducing the need for rescue medication and the incidence of adverse events ( 113607 ). Individual studies are heterogenous with respect to comparator medication and dosing schedule. Doses included a non-commercial turmeric extract 500 mg 3-4 times daily for 4-6 weeks ( 17952 , 89720 ) or turmeric extract 500 mg twice daily for 3 months ( 89722 ). Topical turmeric has also been evaluated. One clinical study shows that applying curcumin topically as a 5% ointment in Vaseline twice daily for 6 weeks reduces pain associated with knee osteoarthritis by a mean of about 11 on a 100-point visual analog scale when compared with placebo ( 104964 ). Another clinical study in patients with knee osteoarthritis shows that applying curcumin in a self-nano-emulsifying polyethylene glycol organogel 1.5 grams to the knee twice daily for 8 weeks reduces pain, stiffness, and difficulty with physical function scores by 72%, 62%, and 46%, respectively, when compared to baseline, with improvements superior to placebo for all outcomes ( 113357 ). Research also shows that taking specific combination products containing turmeric and other ingredients can improve pain and functionality in patients with osteoarthritis. These combination products have combined turmeric with chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride (CartiJoint Forte, Fidia Farmaceutici SpA); boswellic acid (Curamin, EuroPharma USA; Rhulief); Boswellia serrata (Rhulief); ashwagandha, Boswellia serrata, and zinc (Articulin-F, Eisen Pharmaceutical Co. Pvt. Ltd.); devil's claw and bromelain (AINAT, Laboratoire de Rhumatologie Appliquée); Boswellia serrata, guggul, and valerian (Phytoproflex, OPTM Healthcare); Boswellia serrata and terminalia (LI73014F2, Laila Nutraceuticals); ashwagandha, Boswellia serrata, and ginger (Artrex, Mendar); or extracts of ginger rhizome, devil's claw tuber, Boswellia serrata resin, and celery seed (Tregocel, Max Biocare) ( 19276 , 51950 , 81466 , 89717 , 89719 , 96127 , 97419 , 97421 , 97428 , 106078 )( 109280 ). more Pruritus. Oral turmeric has been evaluated for the management of pruritus of various etiologies, with promising results. Clinical research in patients with kidney failure shows that taking turmeric 500 mg orally three times daily for 8 weeks decreases symptoms of uremic pruritus by 1.9-fold when compared with placebo ( 89724 ). Also, a small clinical study in patients with sulfur mustard-induced chronic pruritus shows that taking a specific combination product (C3 Complex, Sami Labs LTD) containing curcumin 1 gram plus extract from black pepper or long pepper (Bioperine) daily for 4 weeks reduces pruritus severity and improves quality of life when compared with placebo ( 81120 , 81176 ). more Possibly Ineffective Alzheimer disease. Neither oral turmeric nor its constituent curcumin appears to improve cognitive function or attenuate cognitive decline in adults with this condition. A small clinical trial shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, 1-4 grams daily for 6 months does not improve mental state examination scores when compared with placebo ( 17096 ). Furthermore, a meta-analysis of this study and another small clinical study in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that the turmeric group experienced greater cognitive decline when compared with placebo ( 100261 ). While this research is limited by small study sizes and heterogeneous patient populations, the current evidence does not support the use of turmeric in patients with this condition. more Peptic ulcers. Oral turmeric does not seem to improve the healing of peptic or gastric ulcers when compared with placebo or liquid antacids. Some clinical research shows that taking turmeric 2 grams three times daily for 8 weeks does not improve the healing of peptic ulcers when compared with placebo in Vietnamese patients ( 81444 ). Also, taking powdered turmeric rhizome 250 mg four times daily for 6 weeks seems to be less effective than a liquid aluminum-magnesium-hydroxide antacid for promoting gastric ulcer healing ( 81284 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acne. Although there has been interest in using topical turmeric for acne, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose. Age-related cognitive decline. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may modestly improve cognition in elderly patients experiencing cognitive decline. A meta-analysis of three small clinical trials shows that curcumin modestly improves cognition in the elderly ( 100261 ). One of these clinical trials shows that taking a specific brand of curcumin (Theracurmin, Theravalues Corp.) 90 mg twice daily for 18 months improves long-term memory and attention when compared with placebo in middle-aged and older adults with or without mild cognitive impairment ( 96161 ). more Amenorrhea. Although there has been interest in using oral turmeric for amenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose. Ankylosing spondylitis. Although there has been interest in using oral turmeric for ankylosing spondylitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose. Anxiety. Some clinical research show that oral curcumin reduces symptoms of anxiety. A meta-analysis of 8 mostly low-quality clinical studies in adults with anxiety symptoms or an anxiety disorder diagnosis shows that taking curcumin 500-1000 mg daily for up to 12 weeks modestly reduces symptoms of anxiety when compared with placebo ( 114902 ). The validity of the meta-analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies, including differences in the patient populations, form and doses curcumin, treatment durations, and types of anxiety scales used. Additionally, all studies were conducted in either Iran or Australia which may limit generalizability of results to other populations. more Aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. A small clinical trial in patients experiencing aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia shows that taking curcuminoids as a nanoemulsion (Curcumin C3 Complex, Sabinsa Corporation) 200 mg daily for 3 months does not improve grip strength or joint symptoms when compared with placebo ( 113345 ). However, this study may have been underpowered to detect a difference between groups. more Asthma. Some small clinical studies suggest that oral turmeric, as an adjunct to conventional asthma treatment, does not improve lung function or symptoms in adults and children with asthma. One small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate asthma shows that adjuvant therapy with turmeric as curcumin 500 mg twice daily for 30 days does not improve lung function based on FEV1, or improve symptoms such as dyspnea, wheezing, cough, or tightness, when compared to standard treatment alone ( 99349 ). A small clinical trial in children 7-18 years of age with moderate to severe asthma shows that adding turmeric 500-1000 mg (containing 20-40 mg curcuminoids) daily for 6 months to standard therapy does not improve overall asthma symptoms when compared with placebo and standard therapy, although it may decrease the frequency of nighttime awakenings and the use of rescue inhalers ( 99348 ). Due to their small sizes and high drop-out rates, these studies may have been underpowered to detect a difference between groups. more Athletic performance. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for athletic performance. Preliminary clinical research in middle-aged male long-distance runners shows that taking a turmeric extract providing 2 grams of curcumin 95% and piperine 5% daily for 6 weeks does not improve aerobic capacity when compared with placebo ( 109286 ). more Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial in BPH. A clinical study in patients with BPH shows that taking curcumin 2250 mg once daily along with tamsulosin and finasteride for 6 months improves lower urinary tract symptoms related to storage, but not overall symptoms or symptoms related to voiding, by about 35%, compared with 25% in those receiving tamsulosin and finasteride alone. Periprostatic fat thickness, quality of life, and erectile function also were improved ( 106799 ). more Beta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for iron overload in patients with beta-thalassemia. A small clinical study in patients with beta-thalassemia major and iron overload shows that taking turmeric extract containing curcumin 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) by 0.6 micromol/L, but not hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, total iron binding capacity, ferritin, or hepcidin, when compared with placebo ( 99306 ). Another small clinical study in adult males with beta-thalassemia intermedia and iron overload shows that taking a higher dose of curcumin 500 mg three times daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces serum iron and ferritin turmeric levels and transferrin saturation when compared with placebo ( 108871 ). more Bruises. Although there has been interest in using topical turmeric to alleviate bruising, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose. Cachexia. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for cancer cachexia. A small clinical trial in patients with cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome shows that taking curcumin 800 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not reduce weight loss or improve body composition or handgrip strength when compared with placebo ( 109283 ). more Canker sores. Some preliminary research suggests that topical curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for minor canker sores. Preliminary clinical research in young adults with minor canker sores shows that applying a 2% curcumin oral gel for 6 months reduces ulcer size, pain, and recurrence rate and increases healing rate similarly to 0.1% triamcinolone oral paste ( 104962 ). The validity of the study is limited by a lack of investigator blinding and the lack of an intention to treat analysis. Another small clinical study shows that applying a 1% curcumin nanomicelle gel (SinaCurcumin Pharmaceuticals) on lesions three times daily for one week is modestly more effective than applying a 2% curcumin gel for reducing pain and ulcer size ( 109282 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a non-curcumin comparator group. more Carpal tunnel syndrome. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. It is unclear if topical curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for carpal tunnel syndrome. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking a combination product containing turmeric, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, phosphatidylserine, and vitamins C, E, B1, B2, B6, and B12 twice daily for 60 days reduces symptom severity and pain but does not improve measures of hand and wrist function when compared with control ( 111702 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding. The study may also be inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Additionally, it is unclear if the effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination. Topical turmeric has also been investigated. A small clinical study in patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that applying a 1% curcuminoid gel (Sinanomin) to the wrists twice daily for 8 weeks modestly decreases symptom severity and improves function when compared with a placebo gel. However, there was no change in electrodiagnostic testing of the injury. All patients also used a night splint ( 113356 ). more Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema. It is unclear if oral or topical turmeric reduces the risk for acral erythema from capecitabine. A small clinical trial in adults with cancer shows that taking turmeric 4 grams daily for 6 weeks starting at the beginning of treatment with capecitabine does not reduce the incidence of acral erythema overall; however, it does seem to reduce acral erythema grade 2 or higher when compared with expected incidence rates ( 99309 ). Topical turmeric has also been evaluated. A clinical study in patients with colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, or breast cancer receiving capecitabine shows that applying a specific ointment (Alpha) standardized to contain curcumin extract 0.5% and henna extract 10% to the soles and palms twice daily, beginning on day 1 of chemotherapy and continued for 4 cycles, does not prevent acral erythema or improve World Health Organization severity scores when compared with placebo. A post-hoc analysis suggests that there may have been a trend toward delayed onset and progression; however, this study was not structured to assess these outcomes ( 108874 ). more Chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral curcumin reduces symptoms of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. A small clinical study in patients with various forms of cancer receiving standard chemotherapy for that cancer type shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg twice daily for 9 weeks does not reduce symptoms of diarrhea when compared with placebo ( 107111 ). more Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). It is unclear if oral curcumin reduces CINV. A small clinical study in patients with various forms of cancer receiving standard chemotherapy for that cancer type shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg twice daily for 9 weeks modestly reduces symptoms of nausea, but not vomiting, in the second and third months after the start of treatment when compared with placebo ( 107111 ). more Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. It is unclear if oral curcumin reduces symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. A small clinical study in patients with various forms of cancer receiving standard chemotherapy for that cancer type shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg twice daily for 9 weeks modestly reduces symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy over a three-month period when compared with placebo ( 107111 ). more Chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for CKD. A meta-analysis of four small clinical trials in patients with CKD related to diabetic nephropathy or lupus nephritis shows that taking curcumin or turmeric for 0.5-4 months moderately reduces proteinuria when compared with placebo ( 109276 ). Also, a small clinical trial in children and young adults ages 6-25 years with vascular dysfunction related to autosomal dominant polycystic disease (PKD) shows that curcumin powder 25 mg/kg daily for 12 months does not improve vascular function or kidney function when compared with placebo ( 107117 ). more Colorectal adenoma. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for managing colorectal adenoma. Preliminary clinical research in adults with familial adenomatous polyposis shows that taking curcumin 1500 mg twice daily for 12 months does not reduce the quantity or size of lower intestinal adenomatous polyps when compared with placebo ( 97427 ). A very small clinical trial in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis shows that taking 8 capsules daily of a turmeric extract, in a formulation also containing pepper fruit, spirulina, seaweed, and ginger root, for 6 months does not affect total polyp number or burden when compared with placebo. However, both number and burden were modestly reduced in the left colon. Each capsule provided curcuminoids 123.65 mg and turmerones 26.79 mg ( 110223 ). more Colorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of colorectal cancer. A small clinical trial in patients undergoing chemotherapy following colorectal cancer surgery shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg daily for 8 weeks modestly improves some measures of quality of life when compared with placebo ( 107109 ). In addition, a small clinical study in people at high risk for colorectal cancer, such as those who smoke, shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, 4 grams daily for 30 days can reduce the number of precancerous rectal aberrant crypt foci ( 18204 ). It is not clear if this results in a reduced risk for colorectal cancer. more Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. One small study suggests that oral turmeric may reduce the risk for myocardial infarction after CABG surgery. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcuminoids, 4 grams daily in four divided doses, beginning 3 days prior to surgery and continuing for 5 days post-surgery, decreases the relative risk of myocardial infarction following CABG by approximately 56% when compared with placebo ( 81143 ). more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral turmeric or its constituent, curcumin, is beneficial for reducing symptoms of COVID-19. Small studies have evaluated curcumin as an adjunctive therapy in adults hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. Patients in these studies also received treatments such as antimicrobials, anti-inflammatory medications, anticoagulants, antiretrovirals, and immunosuppressants ( 104966 , 105393 , 107119 ). One study shows that adding curcumin reduces the duration of shortness of breath by 6-9 days when compared with patients who received other treatments in combination with probiotics. However, there were no differences in the duration of other symptoms, including fever, cough, or sore throat. Subgroup analyses suggest that taking curcumin may improve oxygenation and reduce the need for supplemental oxygen or ventilation ( 105393 ). Another study shows that adding curcumin modestly reduces the time to resolution of COVID-19 symptoms, the length of supplemental oxygen use, and the likelihood for deterioration in the patients' condition when compared with patients who received other treatments alone ( 104966 ). A third study shows some benefit of curcumin on fever and cough when compared with baseline; however, it is unclear if any changes were significant when compared with placebo ( 107119 ). Doses of curcumin used in these studies include curcumin 525 mg with piperine 2.5 mg (C3 Complex, SamiDirect) twice daily, starting at admission and continuing for 14 days ( 105393 ), or a specific nanocurcumin product (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg twice daily for 2 weeks or 240 mg daily in divided doses for 7 days ( 104966 , 107119 ). Limitations of these studies include the small number of patients with severe symptoms, the large number of outcomes evaluated, the inconsistencies in other treatments used, the lack of clarity related to presentation of some results, and, in most cases, a lack of blinding. Turmeric has also been evaluated in adults in the outpatient setting with suspected or confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19. One small clinical study shows that taking curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg twice daily for 14 days in addition to other COVID-19 treatments (mainly hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin) reduces the duration of cough, chills, myalgia, and smell and taste disturbance, but not dyspnea, fever, sore throat, or others, by 1-2 days when compared with placebo with other treatments ( 106802 ). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of confirmatory diagnosis at baseline and lack of consistency with other treatments, as well as the unclear reporting of symptom duration in relation to the initiation of treatment. Another small clinical study in outpatients confirmed to have COVID-19 shows that taking curcumin 1000 mg plus piperine 10 mg (Sami Labs Limited) daily for 14 days modestly improves weakness, but not cough, pain, headache, difficulty breathing, or biochemical indices, when compared with placebo ( 109278 ). However, a clinical study in adults with confirmed asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 shows that taking curcumin (curcuRouge®, TheraBioPharma) 360 mg twice daily for 7 days within 5 days of COVID-19 diagnosis does not reduce the risk of fever or oxygen saturation below 96% when compared with placebo ( 114905 ). Some research has also examined the effect of turmeric as part of a polyherbal combination. Clinical research in patients hospitalized for moderate COVID-19 symptoms shows that using an Ayurvedic formulation 1776 mg twice daily containing turmeric, ashwagandha, ginger, and Boswellia serrata (BV-4051) for 14 days modestly reduces the duration of illness and reduces the severity of fever, cough, and smell and taste dysfunction when compared to placebo. There was no beneficial effect on other symptoms, including nasal congestion, breathing difficulty, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. More than half of the patients were also treated with remdesivir which did not impact the majority of these findings ( 109899 ). more Crohn disease. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for improving symptoms of active Crohn disease. Some clinical research shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, 1.08 grams daily for one month, then 1.44 grams daily for one month, can reduce bowel movements, diarrhea, and abdominal pain when compared to baseline in patients with Crohn disease ( 79730 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Denture stomatitis. Topical turmeric may be beneficial for treating denture stomatitis. A small clinical study in patients with denture stomatitis shows that applying topical curcumin gel (Curenext, Abbott Laboratories) three times daily for 2 weeks resolves denture stomatitis lesions similarly to clotrimazole ointment ( 106797 ). more Diabetes. Lower quality clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may modestly improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes. A meta-analysis of small clinical trials in patients with diabetic kidney disease shows that curcumin reduces levels of fasting glucose by approximately 8.3 mg/dL when compared with placebo. Curcumin was used in doses of 66.3-1670 mg daily for 2-6 months ( 107114 ). Preliminary clinical research included in the analysis shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by about 20 mg/dL ( 104149 ). Other meta-analyses of low- to moderate-quality clinical studies in patients with a variety of conditions including type 2 diabetes show that taking turmeric extract, curcumin, or curcuminoids for 4-36 weeks improves glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.4-0.7% and reduces fasting glucose by approximately 13 mg/dL when compared with placebo or conventional treatment ( 106806 , 108877 , 113604 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies and broad curcuminoid doses ranging from 46-1500 mg daily. Conversely, other meta-analyses in patients with type 2 diabetes show that curcumin does not reduce HbA1c or insulin levels when compared with placebo ( 104965 , 108877 , 113604 ). more Diabetic foot ulcers. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Preliminary clinical research in patients with grade 3 diabetic foot ulcers shows that taking nanocurcumin 80 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or change the rate of ulcer healing when compared with placebo. Taking turmeric did result in modest decreases in fasting blood glucose, insulin levels, and insulin resistance ( 104972 ). more Diabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Meta-analyses of two to four small clinical trials in patients with diabetic kidney disease show that curcumin modestly improves serum levels of creatinine, total cholesterol, and fasting glucose, and reduces systolic blood pressure by 4 mmHg, when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on diastolic blood pressure, proteinuria, or serum levels of other plasma lipids or blood urea nitrogen. Curcumin was used in doses of 66.3-1670 mg daily for 2-6 months ( 107114 ). One small study included in this analysis, which evaluated patients receiving hemodialysis, shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by about 20 mg/dL when compared with placebo ( 104149 ). more Dry eye. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A clinical study in adults with dry eye disease shows that taking a combination supplement containing curcumin extract that provides 200 mg curcuminoids plus lutein, vitamin D3, and zeaxanthin daily for 8 weeks improves tear production and overall patient-reported symptoms (e.g., burning or sore eyes, blurred vision, difficulty reading) when compared with placebo ( 116214 ). However, the clinical significance is unclear, and the use of artificial tears did not differ between groups. It is unclear if these benefits are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination. more Dysmenorrhea. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A clinical study in university students aged 18 to 24 in Iran with mild to severe primary dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) shows that taking a specific combination product containing curcumin 500 mg plus extract from black pepper 5 mg (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) daily, starting 7 days prior to menstruation and continuing for 3 days after menstruation for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles, does not improve the severity of symptoms when compared with placebo ( 106805 ). Conversely, a small clinical study in adults with moderately painful dysmenorrhea shows that taking a single dose of a combination product containing turmeric, Boswellia serrata, and sesame (Rhuleave-K, Arjuna Natural Private Ltd.) 1000 mg at the start of menstruation relieves menstrual cramp pain and reduces pain intensity for up to 6 hours when compared with placebo ( 112806 ). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combinations. more Endometriosis. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for reducing pain due to endometriosis. A small clinical study in adults with endometriosis shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not affect pain associated with endometriosis or quality of life when compared with placebo ( 113603 ). more Erythema. Although there has been interest in using topical turmeric for reducing erythema, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this purpose. Exercise-induced muscle damage. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial for reducing muscle damage from exercise. A meta-analysis of 12 small, lower-quality clinical studies in adults shows that taking curcumin 150-500 mg as a single dose before or after exercise or 180-5000 mg daily for up to 56 days reduces markers of muscle damage (i.e. serum creatine kinase levels) when compared with placebo. Curcumin seems most beneficial for this effect in untrained adults and when administered as a single dose. Additionally, a meta-analysis of 3 of these clinical studies shows that curcumin improves range of motion ( 114897 ). The interpretation of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity. more Exercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral turmeric or its constituent, curcumin, is beneficial for reducing muscle soreness from exercise. A meta-analysis of 12 small, lower-quality clinical studies in trained and untrained adults shows that taking curcumin 150-500 mg as a single dose before or after exercise or 180-5000 mg daily for up to 56 days time reduces muscle soreness when compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis indicated that the largest effect size is observed at 96 hours post-exercise with progressively smaller effect sizes at earlier time points ( 114897 ). The interpretation of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity. Turmeric has also been examined in combination with other ingredients. Clinical research in healthy active adults with moderate to severe exercise-induced muscle pain shows that taking a single, 1000-mg dose of turmeric and Boswellia serrata extracts in black sesame oil (Rhuleave-K; Arjuna Natural Private Ltd.) improves pain relief when compared with placebo, with maximal benefits within about 3 hours. The number of people needed to treat to obtain pain relief of at least 50% over a 6-hour period was 1.1 ( 109277 ). more Gingivitis. Small clinical studies suggest that oral turmeric and turmeric mouthwash may reduce the severity of gingivitis. Turmeric mouthwash appears to be similarly effective to chlorhexidine mouthwash. A meta-analysis of generally preliminary clinical research shows that rinsing with a mouthwash containing curcumin for 3-4 weeks is as effective as rinsing with chlorhexidine for reducing the severity of gingivitis or plaque ( 106059 ). Mouthwashes in these studies contained 0.05% to 20% curcumin and were usually used twice daily for 3-4 weeks ( 81127 , 89723 , 106059 ). One mouthwash contained 0.05% turmeric extract and 0.005% eugenol ( 89723 ). Another small clinical trial shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg daily by mouth after breakfast for 4 weeks reduces the severity of gingivitis and gingival bleeding, but not plaque, when compared with placebo in patients with gingivitis and mild periodontitis ( 104146 ). more Gout. Although there is interest in using oral turmeric for gout, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this condition. Gulf war syndrome. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial in patients with Gulf war syndrome. A small preliminary clinical trial in patients with Gulf war syndrome shows that taking curcumin (Meriva, Indena, S.p.A.) 500 mg twice daily for 30 days reduces overall symptoms, including pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal distress, and others, by 19% when compared with baseline. Taking a higher dose of 2000 mg twice daily for an additional 30 days appears to be no more effective than the lower dose ( 105395 ). more Hearing loss. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for treating hearing loss. A small clinical study in adults with mild to moderate hearing impairment shows that taking curcumin 500 mg daily for 12 weeks improves some measures of auditory function, such as auditory brain stem response threshold, when compared with placebo ( 114906 ). more Helicobacter pylori. Small clinical studies suggest that oral turmeric is not beneficial for eradicating H. pylori when used alone or in combination with standard triple therapy or famotidine. One small clinical study in patients with H. pylori gastritis shows that taking turmeric 2.1 grams daily for 4 weeks is less effective for eradicating H. pylori than taking an omeprazole-based triple regimen for one week ( 80957 ). Another small study in adults with peptic ulcers shows that taking a specific curcumin product (C3 Complex, Sami Labs LTD) 500 mg daily for 7 days, in conjunction with standard triple therapy, does not improve H. pylori eradication rates when compared with standard triple therapy alone. The addition of curcumin increased the resolution of dyspepsia symptoms by an additional 21%, but the clinical significance of this outcome is unclear ( 97420 ). In patients with dyspepsia, most of whom tested positive for fecal H. pylori antigen, clinical research shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg daily in addition to famotidine 40 mg daily for 30 days is no more effective for reducing fecal H. pylori antigen levels than taking famotidine alone ( 106063 ). more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial in patients with hypertension. A meta-analysis of approximately 30 clinical studies in healthy adults or patients with a variety of conditions shows that taking turmeric, curcumin, curcuminoids, or nano-curcumin for 4 to 24 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure by about 2 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by about 0.8 mmHg when compared with placebo ( 113602 ). However, these blood pressure reductions may not be clinically meaningful. In addition, most of the included studies were small and utilized heterogeneous dosing regimens. more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Oral turmeric may modestly improve glucose control in some patients with prediabetes. In overweight or obese individuals with prediabetes, clinical research shows that taking a turmeric extract (BCM95 or Cucugreen; M/s Arjuna Natural Pvt Ltd.) 500 mg daily, providing 95% curcuminoids and at least 65% curcumin, for 90 days, either alone or in combination with zinc 30 mg as zinc gluconate, results in a small reduction in fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared with placebo. There was also a small benefit in insulin sensitivity ( 105391 ). Other preliminary clinical research in adults with prediabetes shows that taking 500 mg of a combination of turmeric extract and Indian gooseberry extract in a 1:2 ratio along with phosphatidylcholine (EmbliQur) twice daily for 6 months modestly reduces fasting glucose and improves insulin resistance, when compared with placebo. However, changes in most other endpoints were not significantly different from placebo. Each 500 mg capsule contained turmeric extracts 29.86% and turmeric oil 1.27% ( 113355 ). The effect of turmeric on progression to type 2 diabetes in patients with prediabetes has also been investigated. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a turmeric extract containing curcumin 750 mg twice daily for 9 months reduces the percentage of patients with prediabetes who develop type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo ( 81163 ). more Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for improving symptoms of IBS. Preliminary clinical research in otherwise healthy adults with IBS shows that taking a turmeric extract (Cynara Turmeric, Lichtwer Pharma) 72-144 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces IBS symptoms by about 40% to 60% when compared to baseline ( 79565 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Taking a combination product (CU-FEO, Alfa Wasserman S.p.A.) containing curcumin 42 mg and fennel essential oil 25 mg per capsule twice daily for 60 days improves overall ratings of abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and quality of life by 24% when compared with placebo ( 97422 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, fennel, or the combination. Observational research suggests that adding a supplement (Enterofytol PLUS) providing curcumin 42 mg and berberine 200 mg twice daily for 2 months to conventional IBS treatment is associated with improvements in symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, distension, and stool status, by up to 48% when compared with conventional treatment alone. Use of the supplement was also associated with a 64% reduced need for conventional treatments ( 113354 ). more Joint pain. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research shows that taking capsules of a specific combination product (Instaflex Joint Support, Direct Digital) containing glucosamine sulfate 1500 mg, methylsulfonylmethane 500 mg, white willow bark extract 250 mg, ginger root concentrate 50 mg, Boswellia extract 125 mg, turmeric root extract 50 mg, cayenne 40 m H.U. 50 mg, and hyaluronic acid 4 mg in three divided doses daily for 8 weeks reduces joint pain severity by 37% compared to only 16% with placebo. However, it does not improve joint stiffness or function when compared with placebo ( 89560 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination. more Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Although there is interest in using oral turmeric for JIA, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this condition. Knee pain. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for knee pain. Clinical research in individuals with knee pain not related to existing arthritis shows that taking turmeric extract (TurmXTRA 60N; Inventia Healthcare Ltd. and Laila Nutraceuticals) 250 mg, providing 60% curcuminoids, once daily for 90 days modestly reduces pain associated with walking 80 meters when compared with placebo. The time taken to walk 80 meters and to climb nine steps was reduced by 4-5 seconds ( 105396 ). more Lichen planus. Evidence is conflicting on whether turmeric is beneficial for lichen planus. A meta-analysis of several small, heterogeneous, mostly low-quality clinical and observational studies in adults with oral lichen planus shows that oral or topical curcumin with or without corticosteroids for 2-12 weeks does not improve erythema, lesion size, or pain when compared with control ( 113605 ). Similarly, a network meta-analysis of small clinical trials in patients with oral lichen planus shows that applying topical turmeric gel does not improve symptoms, clinical resolution, clinical scores, or reduce pain when compared with other available interventions ( 111640 ). However, small individual clinical studies have shown some benefit in using turmeric orally or topically for lichen planus. A small clinical study shows that taking a specific turmeric extract (Curcumin C3 Complex, Sabinsa Corporation) containing curcuminoids 6000 mg daily in three divided doses for 12 days can reduce erythema and ulceration associated with lichen planus when compared with placebo ( 81109 ). Another small clinical study shows that taking a nanocurcumin product (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg orally once daily for 1 month reduces oral lichen planus lesion size, pain, and burning similarly to prednisolone 10 mg taken orally once daily for 1 month ( 104961 ). Additionally, a small clinical study shows that applying turmeric twice daily for 4 months reduces burning, pain, and lesion size when compared to baseline. Turmeric reduces these outcomes similarly to topical ashwagandha or aloe vera ( 115931 ). more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for metabolic syndrome. Research is conflicting on how turmeric, curcumin, and other formulations affect various measures of metabolic syndrome. Some clinical research and a meta-analysis of 13 clinical studies in patients with metabolic syndrome show that taking turmeric or curcumin decreases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, waist circumference by 2 cm, fasting blood glucose by 9 mg/dL, and diastolic blood pressure by 3 mmHg and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 5 mg/dL when compared with placebo. However, other research shows that turmeric or curcumin have no effect on body weight, lipids, blood pressure, or blood glucose when compared with placebo ( 98999 , 99311 , 105400 , 109284 , 111347 , 112118 ). The validity of these effects is limited by high heterogeneity within the included studies and incomplete information about randomization and blinding. Studies have used turmeric, curcumin, and curcumin extract 80-2400 mg, in divided doses, daily for 4-12 weeks, nano-curcumin 80 mg daily for 12 weeks, or calebin A (CurCousin, Sabinsa), which is a constituent of turmeric, 25 mg twice daily for 3 months ( 98999 , 99311 , 105400 , 109284 , 111347 , 112118 ). Also, taking crude or phosphorylated curcuminoids 1 gram daily for 6 weeks does not improve sleep or reduce weight in these patients ( 105397 ). more Migraine headache. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial for migraine headache. A small clinical trial in females with regular migraines shows that taking curcumin 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces the severity and duration, but not the frequency, of migraine headaches when compared with placebo. In individuals taking curcumin, the duration of headache per month was reduced by approximately 10.3 hours from baseline ( 107116 ). more Myocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial for reducing myocardial injury following a MI. Clinical research in patients with an acute MI shows that taking curcuminoids 500 mg plus piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg daily (Sami Labs) for 8 weeks does not improve ejection fraction, serum levels of cardiac troponin 1, blood pressure, levels of fasting blood glucose, or kidney function parameters when compared to placebo. However, there were some modest benefits on levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, and certain liver enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ( 107115 ). The validity of this study is limited by its short duration and relatively small sample size. more Obesity. Oral turmeric might modestly improve weight loss, although any effect is unlikely to be clinically significant. Multiple meta-analyses of small, mostly low-quality clinical studies in adults with a variety of comorbid conditions show that taking various forms and doses of turmeric or curcumin results in an average weight loss of about 0.6-1 kg, a decrease in body mass index (BMI) of about 0.2-0.5 kg/m2, and a decrease in waist circumference of about 1.3 cm when compared with control ( 102345 , 111351 , 111352 ). A sub-analysis of dose and duration shows that a reduction in waist circumference only occurs with curcumin daily doses above 1000 mg, and duration of treatment longer than 8 weeks ( 102345 ). more Oral submucous fibrosis. Small studies suggest that topical or oral curcumin might be beneficial for oral submucous fibrosis. However, the research is heterogenous with respect to outcomes, comparators, and the turmeric preparations, doses, and routes of administration utilized. A meta-analysis of 3 small clinical trials shows that turmeric modestly improves mouth opening when compared with control. In addition, a systematic review of 11 studies shows that turmeric improves overall symptoms, including mouth opening, tongue protrusion, burning sensation, and cheek flexibility. However, studies were small with short duration and used variable dosing strategies. Most trials have studied oral turmeric 300-400 mg, either alone or with black pepper 100 mg or piperine 5 mg, for 3-6 months. Less commonly, turmeric was provided in lozenge form ( 105399 ). Also, a network meta-analysis suggests that the turmeric constituent curcumin with or without piperine is most the effective for reducing tongue protrusion when compared indirectly with various medical and antioxidant therapies; however, this analysis suggests that curcumin does not rank among the most effective interventions for improving mouth opening, burning sensation, or cheek flexibility ( 113514 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific oral product containing curcumin 300 mg and piperine 5 mg (Turmix tablets, Sanat Products), three times daily for 12 weeks, improves mouth opening, burning sensation, and tongue protrusion when compared with baseline, but not when compared with an antioxidant product containing alpha-lipoic acid, beta-carotene, copper, lycopene, selenium, and zinc. Mouth opening is further improved by concurrent use of a mouthwash (Turmix mouthwash, Sanat Products), containing 0.1% w/v turmeric extract (standardized to 95% curcumin), with thymol, eucalyptol, clove oil, mentha oil, and tea tree oil, twice daily for 12 weeks ( 102347 ). A small clinical study shows that applying topical curcumin gel (Curenext, Abbott Laboratories) 5 mg daily in 3-4 divided doses for 6 weeks, in combination with oral physical therapy, improves mouth opening similarly to using an aloe vera gel in combination with oral physical therapy. However, decreases in burning sensation are greater with aloe gel than curcumin gel ( 104967 ). It is not clear whether the gels, oral physical therapy, or the combination of both is responsible for the outcome. Finally, clinical research shows that applying a paste providing turmeric and holy basil 10 grams each, mixed in 10 mL of honey, to the oral mucosa 4 times daily for 3 months modestly improves mouth opening, tongue protrusion, and burning sensation and reduces the presence of fibrous bands when compared with taking a vitamin B supplement. There was no effect on the shape of the uvula ( 113325 ). more Pain (acute). Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in adults with acute musculoskeletal pain shows that taking a specific combination product containing turmeric and Boswellia serrata extracts in black sesame oil (Rhuleave-K; Arjuna Natural Private Ltd.) 1000 mg daily for 7 days is as effective as acetaminophen 1000 mg daily for pain relief, onset of pain relief, and onset of maximal pain relief ( 109287 ). This study is limited by its lack of blinding and placebo control. Additionally, the dose of acetaminophen used in this study is below the standard recommended daily dose. more Periodontitis. There is limited evidence on the oral or topical use of turmeric or its constituent curcumin in patients with periodontitis. A meta-analysis of heterogenous clinical studies in patients with chronic periodontitis suggests that use of local delivery gel products, usually turmeric 2% or a specific product containing curcumin (Curenext), modestly reduces pocket depth when compared with routine products, such as chlorhexidine. However, limited research suggests that curcumin products do not affect plaque or gingivitis measures, and curcumin irrigation does not affect pocket depth based on limited research ( 107108 ). A small preliminary clinical study in patients with severe chronic periodontitis shows that placing curcumin gel 2 mg on one side of the mouth along with scaling and root planing (SRP) reduces plaque and probing pocket depth, but not gingival index, when compared with SRP alone ( 101339 ). The use of oral curcumin has also been investigated. A small clinical trial in patients with gingivitis and mild periodontitis shows that taking a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg daily after breakfast for 4 weeks reduces the severity of gingivitis and gingival bleeding, but not plaque, when compared with placebo ( 104146 ). more Physical performance. It is unclear if oral turmeric may be beneficial for improving physical performance in older adults. A very small clinical study in moderately functioning, sedentary adults over age 65 with low-grade chronic inflammation shows that that taking a specific turmeric extract (Curcumin C3 Complex, Sabinsa Corporation) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve measures of physical function, walking speed, or muscle strength when compared with placebo ( 111357 ). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect any possible differences between groups. more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Small clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin may improve some metabolic parameters in patients with PCOS, but these improvements may not be considered clinically significant. Clinical research in patients with PCOS shows that taking curcumin 500 mg one to three times daily for 6-12 weeks improves some metabolic parameters ( 104968 , 105394 , 106795 ). Conversely, a small clinical study in patients aged 18 to 45 with PCOS in Iran shows that taking curcumin 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fasting glucose but does not improve other metabolic parameters when compared with placebo. Taking curcumin also did not improve testosterone levels or hirsutism scores ( 111355 ). Meta-analyses show that taking curcumin modestly decreases body mass index (BMI) and improves measures of glycemic control, including fasting glucose and insulin resistance, and levels of total cholesterol when compared with placebo or metformin alone. However, effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were mixed and there was no effect on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels ( 105394 , 106795 , 110219 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking curcumin decreases plasma dehydroepiandrosterone and fasting plasma glucose levels when compared with placebo ( 104968 ). Curcumin has also been evaluated in combination therapy. Some clinical research in adults with PCOS also shows that taking nano-curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80-240 mg daily for 3 months in combination with metformin 1500 mg daily modestly improves some metabolic parameters including fasting insulin, insulin resistance, as well as HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with metformin alone or placebo alone ( 106060 , 116944 ). Furthermore, combination therapy with metformin also showed slight improvements in fasting blood glucose and body weight when compared with placebo ( 116944 ). Clinical research in patients with PCOS shows that taking curcumin 500 mg one to three times daily for 6-12 weeks improves some metabolic parameters ( 104968 , 105394 , 106795 ). Conversely, a small clinical study in patients aged 18 to 45 with PCOS in Iran shows that taking curcumin 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fasting glucose but does not improve other metabolic parameters when compared with placebo. Taking curcumin also did not improve testosterone levels or hirsutism scores ( 111355 ). Meta-analyses show that taking curcumin modestly decreases body mass index (BMI) and improves measures of glycemic control, including fasting glucose and insulin resistance, and levels of total cholesterol when compared with placebo or metformin alone. However, effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were mixed and there was no effect on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or triglyceride levels ( 105394 , 106795 , 110219 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking curcumin decreases plasma dehydroepiandrosterone and fasting plasma glucose levels when compared with placebo ( 104968 ). more Postoperative pain. Small clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may modestly reduce pain in various postoperative recovery settings. One small clinical study in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy shows that taking curcumin 2 grams daily reduces postoperative pain, fatigue, and the need for analgesics by the second postoperative week when compared with placebo ( 81099 ). In patients undergoing surgery for inguinal hernia and/or hydrocele, taking curcumin 1.2 grams daily for 5 days reduces inflammation and tenderness by the sixth postoperative day when compared with placebo ( 81206 ). Curcumin was taken in 3-4 divided doses daily in these studies. Finally, taking a single dose of curcumin 200 mg after surgical removal of impacted third molars modestly reduces acute postoperative pain when compared with taking mefenamic acid 500 mg ( 99305 ). more Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is unclear if oral turmeric may be beneficial for improving symptoms of PMS. Some preliminary clinical research in patients with PMS shows that taking curcumin 100 mg twice daily, starting 7 days prior to menstruation and continuing for 3 days after menstruation, improves physical, behavioral, and mood symptoms, as well as overall severity of symptoms, when compared with placebo ( 97433 ). Conversely, in university students aged 18 to 24 in Iran with mild to severe PMS and primary dysmenorrhea, a clinical study shows that taking a specific combination product containing curcumin 500 mg plus extract from black pepper 5 mg (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) daily, starting 7 days prior to menstruation and continuing for 3 days after menstruation for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles, does not improve the severity of symptoms when compared with placebo ( 106805 ). more Prostate cancer. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of prostate cancer. One small clinical study shows that taking curcumin 1.8 grams orally three times daily for 7 days, starting 4 days prior to docetaxel and prednisone treatment and continuing for up to 6 cycles, reduces PSA levels by at least half in 59% of patients when compared to baseline. Also, all patients with measurable lesions showed at least stable disease after treatment, and 40% of patients showed partial response when compared with baseline ( 96132 ). It is unclear if the addition of turmeric is beneficial when compared with docetaxel and prednisone alone. In contrast, an additional small clinical trial shows that taking curcumin 6 grams daily for 7 days every 3 weeks, starting four days before docetaxel, does not improve PSA levels or progression-free or overall survival when compared with docetaxel alone ( 105392 ). more Psoriasis. Evidence is limited to one small study of topical use in patients with scalp psoriasis. Preliminary clinical research in adults with scalp psoriasis shows that applying a tonic of turmeric to the scalp twice daily for 9 weeks modestly improves overall symptoms and quality of life when compared with a placebo tonic ( 97429 ). more Quality of life. Some preliminary clinical research suggests that oral curcumin might improve quality of life in patients with various chronic conditions. Small or low-quality clinical trials in various patient populations show that taking curcumin improves at least some measures of quality of life when compared with placebo. Research has been conducted in patients with cancer, sulfur mustard-induced chronic pruritus, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Studies have evaluated curcumin 2250 mg once daily for 6 months, a specific combination product (C3 Complex, Sami Labs LTD) containing curcumin 500-1000 mg plus piperine (Bioperine) daily for 4-9 weeks, or a combination product (CU-FEO, Alfa Wasserman S.p.A.) containing curcumin 42 mg and fennel essential oil 25 mg per capsule twice daily for 60 days ( 81120 , 81176 , 97422 , 106799 , 107109 , 107111 ). Also, in patients with scalp psoriasis, applying a tonic of turmeric to the scalp twice daily for 9 weeks modestly improves quality of life when compared with a placebo tonic ( 97429 ). more Radiation dermatitis. It is unclear if oral or topical turmeric is beneficial for reducing the severity of radiation dermatitis. A meta-analysis of 4 clinical studies in patients with breast cancer shows that taking curcumin 500-2000 mg three times daily for 3-7 weeks or applying curcumin gel 500 mg three times daily for 7 weeks reduces the radiation dermatitis severity score by about 0.5 points (on a 4-point scale) when compared with placebo or other control ( 111354 ). The validity of this analysis is limited by the heterogeneity of the included studies. However, a small clinical study in patients with breast cancer shows that taking nanocurcumin 80 mg twice daily during and for up to 2 weeks after treatment does not reduce skin reaction severity overall, but does modestly reduce pain, when compared with taking placebo. Also, there was a small reduction in skin reaction severity near the end of the study. All patients also used aloe vera leaf as part of the hospital protocol ( 109281 ). Another small preliminary clinical study in head and neck cancer patients shows that a specific cream (Vicco turmeric cream, Vicco Laboratories) containing turmeric and sandalwood oil, applied 5 times daily during radiation therapy, seems to reduce frequency and severity of radiation dermatitis when compared with baby oil ( 99307 ). more Radiation proctopathy. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for preventing proctitis or cystitis in patients receiving radiotherapy for prostate cancer. A small clinical study in patients with prostate cancer shows that taking a specific nanocurcumin product (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 120 mg daily, for 3 days before and also during a course of radiotherapy, does not reduce the occurrence of proctitis or cystitis when compared with placebo ( 100259 ). This study may have been underpowered to detect small treatment effects. more Respiratory tract infections. Although there is interest in using oral turmeric for various respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and the common cold, it has not been clinically evaluated. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Small clinical studies suggest that oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may modestly improve some symptoms of RA. Meta-analyses of small clinical trials in patients with RA show that taking curcumin alone or with other treatments modestly reduces overall RA symptoms, pain, and markers of inflammation when compared with control groups, including placebo or other treatments. However, some research shows that there is no beneficial effect on tender or swollen joint count from the limited available clinical research ( 109280 , 111358 ), while other research shows that there is a benefit ( 112117 ). Clinical studies have evaluated curcumin 120-1200 mg daily for 2 weeks to 3 months ( 11149 , 18205 , 96129 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the small size of the studies, and in some cases, the lack of a comparator group. more Sarcopenia. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in elderly patients with sarcopenia shows that taking a specific slow-release product containing turmeric, protein, carbohydrate, and fiber (Cureit, Aurea Biolabs), 500 mg orally daily for 3 months, increases handgrip strength by about 1% and distance walked before feeling tired by about 6% when compared with placebo. It also increases weightlifting capacity by about 6% from baseline, compared with a 5% decrease from baseline in those taking placebo ( 104973 ). It is unclear whether these small changes are clinically meaningful. more Schizophrenia. Although there is interest in using oral turmeric for improving cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this use. Sepsis. It is unclear if oral curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, is beneficial in patients with sepsis. A small clinical trial in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with sepsis shows that a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina), 80 mg dissolved in water and administered via gastric tube following lavage twice daily for 10 days does not affect length of ICU stay, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, blood pressure, or heart rate when compared with placebo ( 108873 ). more Smoking cessation. Oral turmeric has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with a history of smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily for at least 3 years shows that taking a specific combination product containing turmeric 50 mg, ashwagandha, Indian gooseberry, tribulus, bacopa, Albizia lebbeck, licorice, clove, ginger, cowhage, and holy basil (Smotect, Smotect India) daily for 3 months reduces the number of cigarettes smoked by approximately 3 per day when compared with placebo. This product also reduces levels of alveolar carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin but does not improve lung capacity ( 112115 ). However, only data from patients who completed treatment were analyzed, which limits the validity of this study. It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with a history of smoking 5 or more cigarettes daily for at least 3 years shows that taking a specific combination product containing turmeric 100 mg, ashwagandha, Indian gooseberry, tribulus, bacopa, Albizia lebbeck, licorice, clove, ginger, cowhage, and holy basil (Smotect, Smotect India) twice daily for 3 months reduces the number of cigarettes smoked by approximately 3 per day when compared with placebo. This product also reduces levels of alveolar carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin but does not improve lung capacity ( 112115 ). However, only data from patients who completed treatment were analyzed, which limits the validity of this study. It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, other ingredients, or the combination. more Stress. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for reducing occupational stress in healthy adults. A small clinical trial in healthy adults with occupational stress-related anxiety and fatigue shows that taking a specific type of turmeric (CurQfen, Akay Flavours and Aromatics Pvt Ltd.) that contains fenugreek dietary fiber for improved bioavailability at a dose of 500 mg twice daily for 30 days reduces stress and fatigue and improves quality of life when compared with placebo, and also when compared with a standard curcumin supplement with lower bioavailability ( 99308 ). more Stroke. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial for stroke. A small clinical study conducted in Iran in adults with a recent ischemic stroke shows that taking curcumin 500 mg and piperine, a pepper constituent, 5 mg (Sami Lans, India) daily for 12 weeks reduces carotid intima-media thickness, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, but does not improve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or quality-of-life indicators when compared with placebo ( 113601 ). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons which can lead studies to erroneously show differences between treatment groups. more Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There is limited evidence on the oral use of turmeric in adults with lupus nephritis. Preliminary clinical research in adults with lupus nephritis shows that taking turmeric 1.5 grams daily in three divided doses for 3 months reduces systolic blood pressure and improves kidney function when compared to baseline ( 81104 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Tuberculosis. It is unclear if oral turmeric is beneficial in patients receiving treatment for tuberculosis. A small clinical study in adults receiving antituberculosis treatment shows that taking a formulation containing turmeric 0.5 grams and Tinospora cordifolia 0.5 grams twice daily for 4 months can reduce levels of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum and improve lesion healing when compared with antituberculosis treatment alone. Also, liver toxicity associated with the antituberculosis treatment seems to be reduced when administered with this formulation ( 80424 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to turmeric, Tinospora cordifolia, or the combination. more Ulcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral or rectal turmeric, or its constituent, curcumin, is beneficial in adults with ulcerative colitis. Although two small clinical studies in adults with ulcerative colitis show that taking oral turmeric extract 2-3 grams daily for 1-6 months improves the rate of remission and reduces relapse rate ( 79966 , 97423 ), a meta-analysis of these studies and one additional clinical study shows that turmeric does not improve remission rates when compared with placebo ( 99000 ). A specific product (Cur-Cure, Bara Herbs Inc) was used in some of these studies. Reasons for the conflicting findings are unclear, but may be due to small patient populations, concerns about blinding, and the inclusion of patients who were also taking immunomodulating drugs. It may also be due to differences in how a study measures remission. A meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis shows that adding oral curcumin 0.5-3 grams daily to standard treatment for 1-6 months may improve clinical remission rates, but not endoscopic remission rates, when compared with placebo ( 108872 ). However, the validity of this finding is limited by the small number of studies that evaluated endoscopic remission. A small clinical study shows that administering an enema form of turmeric extract (NCB-02, Himalaya Drug Company) as 20 mL, containing turmeric extract 140 mg, daily for 8 weeks increases response rate from 50% to about 93% and increases remission rate from about 31% to 71% when compared with placebo in patients with active ulcerative colitis. However, patients using the turmeric extract enema for shorter durations did not improve when compared with placebo ( 89729 ). Turmeric has also been investigated in combination with the Mediterranean diet. A small clinical trial shows that taking curcumin (VeNatura Curcumin Supplement) 800 mg twice daily while following the Mediterranean diet for 8 weeks is no more effective for improving ulcerative colitis symptom severity than following the Mediterranean diet without supplemental curcumin ( 113339 ). more Uveitis. It is unclear if oral curcumin is beneficial for uveitis. Observational research in patients with acute non-infectious uveitic macular edema shows that taking a specific hydrophilic curcumin product (Cucrcuwin, Diabec, Alfa Intes) 60 mg twice daily for 6 months, in conjunction with standard corticosteroid treatment, and then alone for an additional 6 months, modestly improves best corrected visual acuity, but not macular thickness or intraocular pressure, when compared with standard treatment alone for 6 months ( 107110 ). more Wound healing. Although there is interest in using topical turmeric for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of turmeric for this condition. Chemotherapy-induced constipation . It is unclear if oral curcumin reduces symptoms of chemotherapy-induced constipation. A small clinical study in patients with various forms of cancer receiving standard chemotherapy for that cancer type shows that taking curcuminoids (C3 Complex, Sami Labs) 500 mg with piperine (Bioperine) 5 mg twice daily for 9 weeks does not reduce symptoms of constipation when compared with placebo ( 107111 ). more More evidence is needed to rate turmeric for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Turmeric products providing up to 8 grams of curcumin have been safely used for up to 2 months ( 10453 , 11144 , 11150 , 17953 , 79085 , 89720 , 89721 , 89724 , 89728 , 101347 )( 81036 , 101349 , 107110 , 107116 , 107117 , 107118 , 107121 , 109278 , 109283 , 114899 ) and products providing up to 1500 mg of curcumin daily have been safely used for up to 12 months ( 114898 ). Additionally, turmeric in doses up to 3 grams daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 3 months ( 102350 , 104146 , 104148 , 113357 , 114906 ). ...when used topically and appropriately ( 11148 ). Possibly Safe when used as an enema, short-term. Turmeric extract in water has been used as a daily enema for up to 8 weeks ( 89729 ). ...when used topically as a mouthwash, short-term. A mouthwash containing 0.05% turmeric extract and 0.05% eugenol has been used safely twice daily for up to 21 days ( 89723 ). PREGNANCY: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts commonly found in food. PREGNANCY: Likely Unsafe when used orally in medicinal amounts; turmeric might stimulate the uterus and increase menstrual flow ( 12 ). LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts commonly found in food. There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of using turmeric in medicinal amounts during lactation.",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: Turmeric extract has most often been used in doses of 1.5 grams daily for up to 3 months. Turmeric extract has also been used in doses of up to 6 grams daily for a shorter duration of up to 12 days. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Turmeric extract is typically standardized to curcuminoid content, with concentrations ranging from 75% to nearly 100% ( 81109 , 89719 , 89720 , 89721 , 89728 , 89729 , 97426 , 99311 ). Many commercial products also contain piperine, an active constituent of pepper, to improve turmeric bioavailability. This ingredient may or may not be listed on the label ( 97426 ). Topical: Turmeric has been used in various topical formulations, including as a mouthwash, gel, cream, and tonic. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Children Oral: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Standardization & Formulation An evaluation of randomly selected turmeric products available in the United States found that turmeric root products contain 2.5-fold higher concentrations of lead than turmeric-derived curcuminoid extracts ( 97426 ). A specific turmeric extract (NCB-02, Himalaya Drug Company), which has been used in an enema, is standardized to 72% curcumin, 18.08% demethoxycurcumin, and 9.42% bisdemethoxycurcumin ( 89729 ). A specific turmeric extract (Acumin, Aurea Biolabs Ltd) based on a natural turmeric matrix contains 50% curcuminoids by weight ( 96129 ). Another turmeric extract (C3 complex, Sami Labs LTD), which has been used orally, is standardized to 95% curcuminoids comprised of 70-80% curcumin, 15-25% demethoxycurcumin, and 2.5-6.5% bisdemethoxycurcumin ( 81109 ). A specific turmeric extract (Meriva, Indena), marketed as a phytosomal formulation, is standardized to contain 20% curcuminoids (providing 75% curcumin) complexed with soy phosphatidylcholine in a 1:2 weight ratio ( 17953 , 80988 , 97431 , 106062 ). Another specific turmeric extract (BCM-95, Arjuna Natural Extracts) has been standardized to contain 86% to 91% total curcuminoids and 7% to 8% turmeric oils ( 89719 , 89728 , 96127 , 96130 , 105398 ). This extract is used in two products used in clinical research (Curamin and CuraMed). CuraMed contains 552-578 mg of BCM-95 providing 500 mg curcuminoids, 376 mg of curcumin, 124 mg demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin, and 49-52 mg volatile oil. Curamin contains 350 mg BCM-95, as well as 150 mg boswellia extract, 75% boswellic acids and 10% 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-boswellic acid (AKBA) ( 96127 ). This extract has also been used in another product (Biocurcumax) ( 96130 ). A specific turmeric extract containing curcumin-galactomannoside complex (CurQfen, standardized to contain not less than 35% of curcuminoids) 500 mg has been used ( 99308 , 106804 ). Finally, a specific turmeric rhizome extract (Turmacin, Natural Remedies Pvt. Ltd.) is standardized to contain 12.6% polysaccharides ( 89721 ).",
  "interactions_text": "Expand All | Collapse All ALKYLATING AGENTS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Turmeric has antioxidant effects. Theoretically, this may reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals. However, research is conflicting. In vitro research suggests that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, inhibits mechlorethamine-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells by up to 70%. Also, animal research shows that curcumin inhibits cyclophosphamide-induced tumor regression ( 96126 ). However, some in vitro research shows that curcumin does not affect the apoptosis capacity of etoposide. Also, other laboratory research suggests that curcumin might augment the cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents. Reasons for the discrepancies may relate to the dose of curcumin and the specific chemotherapeutic agent. Lower doses of curcumin might have antioxidant effects while higher doses might have pro-oxidant effects ( 96125 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, turmeric might have on alkylating agents. more AMLODIPINE (Norvasc) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Taking turmeric with amlodipine may increase levels of amlodipine. Animal research shows that giving amlodipine 1 mg/kg as a single dose following the use of turmeric extract 200 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks increases the maximum concentration and area under the curve by 53% and 56%, respectively, when compared with amlodipine alone ( 107113 ). Additional animal research shows that taking amlodipine 1 mg/kg with a curcumin 2 mg/kg pretreatment for 10 days increases the maximum concentration and area under the curve by about 2-fold when compared with amlodipine alone ( 103099 ). more ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Turmeric may have antiplatelet effects and may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. However, research is conflicting. Curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, has demonstrated antiplatelet effects in vitro ( 11143 , 81204 , 81271 ). Furthermore, two case reports have found that taking turmeric along with warfarin or fluindione was associated with an increased international normalized ratio (INR) ( 89718 , 100906 ). However, one clinical study in healthy volunteers shows that taking curcumin 500 mg daily for 3 weeks, alone or with aspirin 100 mg, does not increase antiplatelet effects or bleeding risk ( 96137 ). It is possible that the dose of turmeric used in this study was too low to produce a notable effect. more ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, taking turmeric with antidiabetes drugs might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Animal research and case reports suggest that curcumin, a turmeric constituent, can reduce blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes ( 79692 , 79984 , 80155 , 80313 , 80315 , 80476 , 80553 , 81048 , 81219 ). Furthermore, clinical research in adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking curcumin 475 mg daily for 10 days prior to taking glyburide 5 mg decreased postprandial glucose levels for up to 24 hours when compared with glyburide alone, despite the lack of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction ( 96133 ). Other clinical studies in patients with diabetes show that taking curcumin daily can reduce blood glucose levels when compared with placebo ( 104149 , 114898 , 114900 ). more ANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Turmeric has antioxidant effects. Theoretically, this may reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals. However, research is conflicting. In vitro and animal research shows that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, inhibits doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells by up to 65% ( 96126 ). However, curcumin does not seem to affect the apoptosis capacity of daunorubicin. In fact, some research shows that curcumin might augment the cytotoxic effects of antitumor antibiotics, increasing their effectiveness. Reasons for the discrepancies may relate to the dose of curcumin and the chemotherapeutic agent. Lower doses of curcumin might have antioxidant effects while higher doses might have pro-oxidant effects ( 96125 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effects, if any, antioxidants such as turmeric have on antitumor antibiotics. more CYTOCHROME P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase or decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1A1. However, research is conflicting. Most in vitro and animal research suggests that the turmeric constituent, curcumin, INHIBITS CYP1A1, primarily in the liver ( 15823 , 21495 , 80876 , 81411 ). However, some evidence from in vitro research suggests that curcumin may INDUCE CYP1A1 in the intestines ( 21500 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2. However, research is conflicting. In vitro and animal research show that the turmeric constituent, curcumin, inhibits CYP1A2 ( 15823 , 21497 , 81304 ). However, other in vitro research suggests that curcumin does not significantly affect CYP1A2 ( 22000 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Turmeric might increase or decrease levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. In vitro and animal research show that turmeric and its constituents curcumin and curcuminoids inhibit CYP3A4 ( 21497 , 21498 , 21499 ). Also, 8 case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) adverse drug reaction database describe increased toxicity in patients taking turmeric and cancer medications that are CYP3A4 substrates, including everolimus, ruxolitinib, ibrutinib, and palbociclib, and bortezomib ( 111644 ). In another case report, a transplant patient presented with acute nephrotoxicity and elevated tacrolimus levels after consuming turmeric powder at a dose of 15 or more spoonfuls daily for ten days prior. It was thought that turmeric increased levels of tacrolimus due to CYP3A4 inhibition ( 93544 ). Conversely, other in vitro research suggests that turmeric induces CYP3A4 activity, leading to reduced levels of CYP3A4 substrates ( 111404 ). An animal model suggests that induction of CYP3A4 occurs after daily curcumin use for 1 week ( 116945 ). However, the induction of CYP3A4 by turmeric has not been reported in humans. more DOCETAXEL (Taxotere) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase blood levels of oral docetaxel. Animal research suggests that the turmeric constituent, curcumin, enhances the oral bioavailability of docetaxel ( 80999 ). However, the significance of this interaction is unclear, as this drug is typically administered intravenously in clinical settings. more ESTROGENS Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, large amounts of turmeric might interfere with hormone replacement therapy through competition for estrogen receptors. In vitro research shows that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, displaces the binding of estrogen to its receptors ( 21486 ). more GLYBURIDE (Diabeta, others) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, taking turmeric and glyburide in combination might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Clinical research shows that taking curcumin 475 mg daily for 10 days prior to taking glyburide 5 mg increases blood levels of glyburide by 12% at 2 hours after the dose in patients with type 2 diabetes. While maximal blood concentrations of glyburide were not affected, turmeric modestly decreased postprandial glucose levels for up to 24 hours when compared to glyburide alone, possibly due to the hypoglycemic effect of turmeric demonstrated in animal research ( 96133 ). more HEPATOTOXIC DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, turmeric might increase the risk of liver damage when taken with hepatotoxic drugs. There is concern that turmeric might cause hepatotoxicity, especially when highly bioavailable formulations are used in high doses ( 103633 , 107122 , 109288 , 110221 ). more LOSARTAN (Cozaar) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase the effects of losartan. Research in hypertensive rats shows that taking turmeric can increase the hypotensive effects of losartan ( 110897 ). more METHOTREXATE (Trexall, others) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, turmeric might have additive effects when used with hepatotoxic drugs such as methotrexate. In one case report, a 39-year-old female taking methotrexate, turmeric, and linseed oil developed hepatotoxicity ( 111644 ). more NORFLOXACIN (Noroxin) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase the effects and adverse effects of norfloxacin. Animal research shows that taking curcumin, a turmeric constituent, can increase blood levels of orally administered norfloxacin ( 80863 ). more ORGANIC ANION-TRANSPORTING POLYPEPTIDE SUBSTRATES (OATP) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase blood levels of OATP4C1 substrates. In vitro research shows that the turmeric constituent curcumin competitively inhibits OATP4C1 transport. This transporter is expressed in the kidney and facilitates the renal excretion of certain drugs ( 113337 ). Theoretically, taking turmeric might decrease renal excretion of OATP substrates. more P-GLYCOPROTEIN SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase the absorption of P-glycoprotein substrates. In vitro and animal research shows that curcuminoids and other constituents found in turmeric can inhibit P-glycoprotein expression and activity ( 21472 , 21473 , 21474 , 21475 , 21476 , 21477 , 21478 , 21479 , 21480 )( 21482 , 21484 , 111644 ). more PACLITAXEL (Abraxane, Onxol) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might alter blood levels of paclitaxel, although any effect may not be clinically relevant. Clinical research in adults with breast cancer receiving intravenous paclitaxel suggests that taking turmeric may modestly alter paclitaxel pharmacokinetics. Patients received paclitaxel on day 1, followed by either no treatment or turmeric 2 grams daily from days 2-22. Pharmacokinetic modeling suggests that turmeric reduces the maximum concentration and area under the curve of paclitaxel by 12.1% and 7.7%, respectively. However, these changes are not likely to be considered clinically relevant ( 108876 ). Conversely, animal research suggests that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, enhances the oral bioavailability of paclitaxel ( 22005 ). However, the significance of this interaction is unclear, as this drug is typically administered intravenously in clinical settings. more SULFASALAZINE (Azulfidine) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Turmeric might increase the effects and adverse effects of sulfasalazine. Clinical research shows that taking the turmeric constituent, curcumin, can increase blood levels of sulfasalazine by 3.2-fold ( 81131 ). more TACROLIMUS (Prograf) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Turmeric might increase the effects and adverse effects of tacrolimus. In one case report, a transplant patient presented with acute nephrotoxicity and elevated tacrolimus levels of 29 ng/mL. The patient previously had tacrolimus levels within the therapeutic range at 9.7 ng/mL. Ten days prior to presenting at the emergency room the patient started consumption of turmeric powder at a dose of 15 or more spoonfuls daily. It was thought that turmeric increased levels of tacrolimus due to cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibition ( 93544 ). In vitro and animal research show that turmeric and its constituent curcumin inhibit CYP3A4 ( 21497 , 21498 , 21499 ). more TALINOLOL Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Turmeric may reduce the absorption of talinolol in some situations. Clinical research shows that taking curcumin for 6 days decreases the bioavailability of talinolol when taken together on the seventh day ( 80079 ). The clinical significance of this effect is unclear. more TAMOXIFEN (Nolvadex) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, turmeric might reduce the levels and clinical effects of tamoxifen. In a small clinical trial in patients with breast cancer taking tamoxifen 20-30 mg daily, adding curcumin 1200 mg plus piperine 10 mg three times daily reduces the 24-hour area under the curve of tamoxifen and the active metabolite endoxifen by 12.8% and 12.4%, respectively, as well as the maximum concentrations of tamoxifen, when compared with tamoxifen alone. However, in the absence of piperine, the area under the curve for endoxifen and the maximum concentration of tamoxifen were not significantly reduced. Effects were most pronounced in patients who were extensive cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 metabolizers ( 107123 ). more TOPOISOMERASE I INHIBITORS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Turmeric has antioxidant effects. There is some concern that this may reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals. However, research is conflicting. In vitro research shows that curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, inhibits camptothecin-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells by up to 71% ( 96126 ). However, other in vitro research shows that curcumin augments the cytotoxic effects of camptothecin. Reasons for the discrepancies may relate to the dose of curcumin and the chemotherapeutic agents. Lower doses of curcumin might have antioxidant effects while higher doses might have pro-oxidant effects ( 96125 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, turmeric might have. more TRAMADOL (Ultram) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, turmeric might increase or decrease levels of tramadol. Animal research suggests that a single dose of curcumin, a constituent of turmeric, may increase tramadol's maximum concentration (Cmax) by inhibiting metabolism, while continued daily use for 7 days may reduce the area under the curve (AUC) due to the induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) ( 116945 ). However, this interaction has not been reported in humans. more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Turmeric might increase the risk of bleeding with warfarin. One case of increased international normalized ratio (INR) has been reported for a patient taking warfarin who began taking turmeric. Prior to taking turmeric, the patient had stable INR measurements. Within a few weeks of starting turmeric supplementation, the patient's INR increased to 10 ( 100906 ). Additionally, curcumin, the active constituent in turmeric, has demonstrated antiplatelet effects in vitro ( 11143 , 81204 , 81271 ), which may produce additive effects when taken with warfarin. more",
  "mechanism_text": "General The applicable part of turmeric is the rhizome or roots. Turmeric's major active constituents are the curcuminoids ( 80713 , 80809 ), which include the polyphenol curcumin (diferuloylmethane) ( 80405 , 80434 , 80599 , 80642 , 80691 , 102345 ), demethoxycurcumin ( 80405 , 80434 , 80599 , 80642 , 80691 ), bisdemethoxycurcumin ( 80405 , 80434 , 80599 , 80642 , 80691 ), calebin, and other diarylheptanoids ( 79809 ). Turmeric rhizomes or roots also contain tumerin, tumerones ( 78963 , 79338 , 79465 , 79924 , 80125 , 102350 ) and turmeronols ( 102350 ), and sesquiterpenes ( 79124 , 79924 , 80095 , 80125 , 80454 ). Other constituents of turmeric include minerals such as iron and potassium ( 79427 , 80521 ); fatty acids, such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid ( 49742 ); and the polysaccharides ukonans A-D ( 79468 , 79587 , 81186 ). Analgesic effects Orally, turmeric and its constituent curcumin have been shown to reduce pain, particularly the late phase of pain, in animal models ( 80451 , 80511 ). Although the exact mechanism of action is not clear, some evidence from in vitro research suggests that curcumin can inhibit transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-mediated pain hypersensitivity ( 80898 ). Anti-allergy effects Human research suggests that treatment with curcumin decreases the production of inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins from monocytes and neutrophils ( 96138 ). Anti-Alzheimer effects There is preliminary evidence that curcumin might have activity in Alzheimer disease. In middle-aged and elderly adults, taking curcumin prevents measures of amyloid and/or tau accumulation in the amygdala and hypothalamus ( 96161 ). In animal models, curcumin caused disaggregation of amyloid beta, and decreased brain amyloid, plaque, and oxidized protein levels ( 17096 , 79074 , 79941 , 80080 , 80534 ). In vitro evidence suggests that curcumin reduces beta-amyloid production by inhibiting the upregulation of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which is the rate-limiting enzyme for beta-amyloid production ( 80368 , 80409 ). Other in vitro research suggests that curcuminoids increase the clearance of amyloid beta from mononuclear cells and enhance the uptake of amyloid beta by macrophages from patients with Alzheimer disease ( 79941 , 80144 , 80520 ). In addition to reducing the production and increasing the clearance of amyloid beta, in vitro and animal research also suggest that curcuminoids from turmeric protect against impairment by, or toxicity of, amyloid protein ( 79023 , 79096 , 79179 , 80913 , 81030 ). Evidence from animal research also suggests that curcuminoids have acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities ( 80469 , 80971 ). Anti-arthritic effects In human research, some research has found that curcumin inhibits levels of inflammatory markers associated with arthritis, including C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and/or the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( 96129 , 110222 ). It also has antioxidant effects ( 110222 ) and may inhibit interleukin 1-beta (IL-1-beta) stimulated inflammatory and catabolic mediators, including prostaglandin E2, IL-6, IL-8, and nitric oxide ( 102349 , 110222 ). Animal models suggest that turmeric extract reduces arthritis-associated joint inflammation by inhibiting NF-kB activation ( 79961 ). Curcumin also seems to suppress the production of matrix metalloproteinases, which are involved in cartilage degradation ( 79010 , 80787 , 102349 ). It also has a protective effect against degradation and the catabolic function of IL-1-beta, lipopolysaccharides, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in chondrocytes and cartilage ( 102349 ). Curcumin also stimulates matrix regeneration by restoring synthesis of collagen type II and glycosaminoglycan ( 102349 ). In vitro evidence suggests that turmeric rhizome extract inhibits the growth and promotes apoptosis in synovial fibroblasts, which are generally characterized by hyperplasia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( 80153 ). Also, in vitro evidence suggests that curcumin inhibits the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which is involved in rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis ( 70963 ). Anti-gingivitis effects Preliminary clinical research suggests that turmeric-containing mouthwashes may help reduce gingivitis severity in patients with this condition ( 81127 , 89723 ). Potential mechanisms of action may include a reduction of the inflammatory cell infiltrate and increased collagen content and fibroblastic cell numbers ( 81062 ), inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta gene expression induced by a specific periodontopathic bacterium ( 80466 ), and inhibition of nicotine-induced ERK expression, which is involved in periodontal disease ( 79576 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Curcumin seems to have anti-inflammatory activity, possibly by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other cytokines involved in pro-inflammatory signaling pathways ( 11138 , 11139 , 11140 , 12482 , 18205 , 79251 , 79661 , 80480 , 81203 , 96139 )( 102347 , 107116 ). Curcumin also seems to inhibit inflammatory enzymes such as collagenase, elastase, and hyaluronidase ( 79251 ). Additionally, clinical research in mixed populations, including healthy adults as well as patients with a variety of comorbidities or autoimmune disorders, shows that turmeric or curcumin reduces the inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), high-sensitivity (hs)-CRP, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, the effect of turmeric or curcumin on IL-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is inconsistent ( 100260 , 106793 , 106794 , 106795 , 106804 , 107109 , 107116 , 107119 , 108873 , 108875 )( 110218 , 110219 , 111353 , 114898 , 114899 , 114900 , 114903 ). Other research in humans has found no effect of curcumin on these or other inflammatory mediators ( 105396 , 107109 , 107117 , 107119 ). Anti-lithogenic effects In humans, curcumin can induce gallbladder contractions ( 11145 , 78882 ). Theoretically, this may prevent gallstone production, as shown in animal models ( 79339 , 81094 ). Anticancer effects Turmeric exhibits chemopreventive and growth inhibitory activity against several tumor cell lines ( 79042 , 79580 , 79689 , 81110 , 81209 , 81273 , 81331 , 81349 , 81350 , 81440 ). It seems to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, possibly by upregulating p53 expression, and may inhibit angiogenesis ( 11141 , 11142 , 12482 , 81065 ). Curcumin might reduce activity of procarcinogenic eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin-E2 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), via inhibition of cyclooxygenases and 5-lipoxygenase ( 18204 , 80504 , 80834 , 80917 ). Preliminary evidence suggests curcumin can also reduce precancerous rectal aberrant crypt foci ( 18204 , 81294 ). Some laboratory evidence suggests that curcumin can inhibit the cellular pathways leading to tumor metastasis, invasion, and angiogenesis ( 96132 ). Turmeric may also reduce the carcinogenic effect of other drugs or chemicals. In animal models, benzo(a)pyrene-related CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 induction is normalized by a 1% turmeric diet, suggesting that turmeric might inhibit activation of carcinogens that are metabolized by CYP enzymes ( 15823 , 15824 ). The turmeric diet also appears to increase glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity in some tissues ( 15823 ). Antidepressant effects In humans, the antidepressant effects of curcumin were related to decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines and increased levels of serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Decreased cortisol levels also suggest the role of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis in the anti-depressant effects of curcumin ( 96139 , 114898 ). Evidence from in vitro and animal research suggests that the antidepressant effects of turmeric extract stem from its ability to inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and possibly MAO B, which leads to increased levels of serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline ( 79192 , 79652 , 79707 , 80432 ). The turmeric constituent curcumin also appears to increase adenylyl cyclase activity and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration, which has been associated with antidepressant effects ( 80607 ). Antidiabetic effects Evidence from animal and clinical research suggests that turmeric and its constituents reduce levels of glucose and HbA1c ( 79114 , 79591 , 79692 , 79970 , 79984 , 80785 , 114898 , 114900 ) and elevate plasma insulin levels ( 80785 , 81048 ), which may improve blood glucose control in diabetics. Evidence from animal models suggests that turmeric may reduce diabetic neuropathic pain by inhibiting the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide (NO) ( 79842 ). In addition to reducing diabetic neuropathic pain, turmeric may also prevent the development of diabetes-associated neuronal damage. Animal models suggest that turmeric may reduce neuronal damage associated with diabetes by reducing the expression of cerebellar proteins associated with cholinergic and insulin receptor activity, as well as glucose transport ( 80810 ). Curcuminoids from turmeric also appear to reduce diabetes-associated neuronal injury via antioxidant effects ( 80493 ). Animal models suggest that curcumin may protect against the development of diabetic nephropathy by decreasing dephosphorylation and increasing acetylation of histone H3 and attenuating the increased expression of HSP-27 and MAP kinase p38 in the diabetic kidney ( 80249 ). Curcumin may also prevent diabetes-associated kidney dysfunction by inhibiting the histone acetyltransferase p300 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) ( 80594 , 80742 ). Animal models suggest that curcumin may help prevent the development of diabetic retinopathy by inhibiting diabetes-induced increases in interleukin-1beta, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and NF-kB levels in the retina ( 80071 , 80147 ). A meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, migraine, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or kidney failure shows that nanocurcumin supplementation improves fasting blood glucose levels, but not glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), regardless of baseline fasting blood glucose levels, trial duration, or body weight. Fasting insulin levels and insulin resistance also are improved ( 106793 ). Antimicrobial effects Turmeric or its curcuminoid constituents seem to have activity against some bacteria, including Eschericia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ( 36131 , 39892 , 43458 , 51912 , 80183 , 80481 , 80569 , 80798 ). Some in vitro evidence suggests that the antibacterial action of curcumin against E. coli results from curcumin's inhibition of enoyl-ACP reductase from E. coli ( 80871 ). Other in vitro evidence suggests that curcumin inhibits the bacterial cell proliferation of Bacillus subtilis by inhibiting the assembly of FtsZ ( 80192 ). Additional in vitro evidence shows that turmeric constituents inhibit sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus cells, which prevents these cells from adhering to fibronectin; this may reduce S. aureus invasion of endothelial cells ( 79742 ). Other in vitro research shows that curcumin inhibits Ikappa B kinase-alpha and -beta and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase in Neisseria gonorrhoeae cells, which prevents the bacteria from adhering to mucosal epithelial cells ( 79637 ). Turmeric also appears to have activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ( 11140 , 79359 ), hepatitis C ( 80886 ), hepatitis B ( 79694 , 80644 ), herpes simplex ( 78899 , 80244 ), and Epstein-Barr ( 79116 , 81376 ) viruses. Also, animal models show that curcumin may have activity against the protozoan Leishmania amazonensis ( 11140 , 79309 ), Toxoplasma gondii ( 80570 ), Schistosomiasis mansoni ( 80586 ), Giardia lamblia ( 79865 ), and Plasmodium ( 79980 , 80619 , 81011 ). In vitro evidence suggests that curcumin has antiparasitic activity against Cryptosporidium parvum ( 80706 ). Antioxidant effects Preliminary research suggests that turmeric and its constituent curcumin might have antioxidant effects ( 11140 , 11147 ). Both turmeric and its constituents have been found to scavenge free radicals and phenolic oxidants and decrease levels of reactive oxygen species ( 39885 , 49430 , 71907 , 79090 , 79204 , 80370 , 102347 ). Curcumin has been shown to increase levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and other antioxidant enzymes in vitro and in animal research ( 80306 , 80370 , 80891 , 81055 , 81070 ). However, results of research in humans is mixed regarding the effect of turmeric or curcumin on levels of SOD or total antioxidant capacity, and some research shows that it reduces levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of oxidation ( 100260 , 106804 , 109286 , 111353 , 114898 , 114899 , 114903 ). In one study, plasma vitamin E increased after 6 months of treatment with 1-4 grams/day of curcumin, possibly indicating that antioxidant effects of curcumin were sparing vitamin E ( 17096 ). Antishiga toxin effects In vitro evidence suggests that curcumin can reduce cell death associated with shiga toxin (stx)1 by enhancing expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) ( 79028 ) or blocking the binding of stx to cells ( 79903 ). Theoretically, this may contribute to the antidiarrheal effects of curcumin. Antithrombotic effects Curcumin might have antithrombotic effects. Preliminary research suggests it might inhibit platelet-activating factor and arachidonic acid platelet aggregation, possibly by interfering with thromboxane synthesis ( 11143 , 46897 , 81217 ) or by blocking TNF-alpha-induced expression of thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor ( 79578 ). Cardiovascular effects In human research, curcuminoids decrease the risk of myocardial infarction following coronary artery bypass grafting ( 81143 ). Laboratory evidence suggests that turmeric may protect against myocardial infarction by reducing inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix proteases ( 79382 , 79588 , 79607 , 80371 , 80653 , 80802 ). Other cardiovascular effects induced by turmeric in laboratory research include blood pressure reduction ( 79673 , 107113 ), vasorelaxation ( 79544 , 79645 , 80075 , 81078 ), antithrombosis ( 78888 , 79701 ), lipid level lowering ( 80325 , 80640 ), and endothelial function improvement ( 80371 , 80662 ).. Meta-analyses show that curcumin increases flow-mediated dilation, but not other measures of endothelial function ( 102348 , 114903 ). Clinical studies show that turmeric or curcumin reduce some measures of arterial stiffness, including pulse wave velocity ( 101340 , 114900 , 114903 ). In atherosclerotic animal models, curcumin reduced atherosclerotic lesions ( 79150 , 80325 ), improved left ventricular function ( 79382 , 80802 , 80924 ), and reversed cardiac hypertrophy ( 80724 ). Inhibition of migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), and promotion of cell differentiation, have also been reported in animal and in vitro research ( 79073 , 79325 , 79426 , 79729 , 81419 ). There is also interest in using turmeric to reduce cardiovascular risk. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, migraine, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or kidney failure shows that nanocurcumin supplementation improves levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol among those with elevated baseline levels and obesity. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is also improved, regardless of baseline levels or trial duration, particularly in those with metabolic syndrome or obesity and those who are overweight. Systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic blood pressure, is also improved, particularly in those with elevated baseline systolic blood pressure, with trial duration less than 12 weeks, and in those with metabolic syndrome ( 106793 ). Fertility effects Evidence from in vitro and animal research suggests that curcumin can decrease sperm motility and density; cause degenerative changes in the seminiferous tubules; reduce luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated production of testosterone in adult Leydig cells; and reduce fertility when administered orally ( 79335 , 79404 , 80650 , 80944 , 81069 ). These effects are attributed to the inhibition of Leydig cell function or the hypothalamus-pituitary axis ( 79404 ). However, some evidence suggests that curcumin has positive effects on fertility. Laboratory research suggests that curcumin protects against the death of follicular cells and improves oocyte maturation in immune ovarian failure ( 81031 ). It also protects against ischemia-reperfusion induced injury of the testicles ( 80259 ). Gastrointestinal effects In both human and animal research, turmeric or its constituents increased bowel motility ( 80494 , 81075 ). In animal research, curcumin improved activity of digestive enzymes ( 49538 ). In animal research, turmeric and its constituent curcumin reduced the incidence of gastrointestinal ulcers and increased intestinal wall mucus and nonprotein sulfhydryl content ( 80042 , 80560 , 81187 ). Evidence from animal models also suggests that turmeric and its constituent curcumin reduce injury related to inflammatory colitis ( 79199 , 79247 , 79267 , 79891 ). Hematologic effects Clinical research in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis shows that administering a specific nanoparticle formulation of curcumin (SinaCurcumin, ExirNanoSina) 80 mg twice daily for 10 days decreases white blood cell, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts, all of which were elevated at baseline, when compared with placebo. Curcumin also reduced platelet counts when compared with placebo, although these levels remained in the normal range throughout the study ( 108873 ). Hepatoprotective effects Turmeric is traditionally used for liver health and for the treatment of jaundice and hepatitis. In animal models, turmeric constituents have been shown to attenuate induced liver damage and fibrosis ( 78957 , 79322 , 79439 , 80416 , 80699 , 80705 , 80831 , 80846 , 80857 , 80923 ). Potential mechanisms of action include beneficial effects on levels and activity of inflammatory cytokines or matrix metalloproteases ( 79551 , 79915 , 80055 , 80216 , 80416 , 80699 , 80831 , 80846 , 80942 ). While most animal research shows that turmeric is hepatoprotective, some toxicity studies in animals suggests that turmeric extracts can increase liver enzymes and liver weight, especially when given in high doses for longer durations. Rarely, turmeric has been linked to cases of acute non-infectious cholestatic hepatitis, and most often these cases are related to the use of highly bioavailable formulations at high doses ( 103633 ). There is also evidence that the risk for hepatotoxicity with turmeric may be increased in individuals with the HLAB*35:01 allele ( 109288 ). However, the mechanism of turmeric-induced hepatotoxicity is unclear. Hypolipidemic effects Clinical research suggests turmeric reduces levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides ( 78995 , 89725 , 114900 ). Curcumin and other constituents of turmeric also decrease levels of oxidized LDL ( 81268 , 81306 ). Animal research suggests that turmeric may lower cholesterol by stimulating the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids by increasing the activity of hepatic cholesterol-7 alpha hydroxylase ( 80225 , 81086 , 81338 , 81445 ). Other animal research suggests that turmeric decreases levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), which limits the formation of cholesterol in the body ( 81086 ). In vitro evidence suggests that the turmeric constituent curcumin upregulates the expression of LDL receptors on the surface of mouse macrophage and human hepatoma cells, which increases cholesterol uptake by these cells ( 79782 , 79873 , 80415 ). Immunomodulatory effects Preliminary research suggests that turmeric and curcumin might have immunostimulatory effects ( 11140 , 11147 ). Iron chelating effects Human research in adults with beta-thalassemia intermedia shows that taking curcumin 500 mg three times daily for 3 months in addition to the iron chelator deferasirox and standard treatment downregulates mRNA expression of growth differentiating factor 15 (GDF-15), which may in turn reduce suppression of hepcidin levels. Elevated hepcidin promotes internalization and degradation of the transmembrane iron exporter ferroportin, thereby inhibiting the release of iron from enterocytes, hepatocytes, and macrophages into the plasma, resulting in iron-chelating effects ( 113606 ). Musculoskeletal effects A small clinical study in healthy young adult females with moderate physical activity levels shows that taking curcumin 500 mg daily for 8 weeks decreases muscle damage, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase, and improves maximum oxygen update (VO2 max) when compared with placebo ( 106804 ). Radioprotective effects Preliminary clinical and animal research suggests that turmeric or its constituent curcumin can decrease radiation-induced mucositis ( 79436 , 89726 ). Potential mechanisms of action may involve a reduction in chromosomal aberrations, chromosomal fragments, and DNA strand breaks ( 78880 , 79140 , 79435 , 80376 , 81265 , 81435 ). The protective effects may also be related to the antioxidant effects of turmeric ( 78877 , 80955 ). Renal protective effects In animal models, turmeric or curcumin prevented renal injury and reduced inflammation induced by ischemia/reperfusion or by agents such acetaminophen or cyclosporine ( 79663 , 79725 , 79798 , 80579 , 80622 , 80624 , 80857 , 80948 , 81413 ). Also, curcumin has been shown to inhibit the accumulation of collagen IV and fibronectin in the glomeruli of animals with nephritis ( 79488 ). Respiratory effects Turmeric is commonly used for bronchitis and respiratory infections. Although there is inadequate human research investigating curcumin for this purpose, laboratory research has been conducted in both animals and in vitro models. Curcumin has been found to prevent fibrosis following induced lung injury ( 78982 , 79295 , 79889 , 80118 , 80912 ). Curcumin also appears to inhibit lung inflammation ( 80806 , 80909 ), airway hyperreactivity ( 79284 , 80956 ), and pulmonary emphysema ( 80548 ). Potential mechanisms of action included the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines ( 78982 , 79133 , 79295 , 79555 , 80045 , 80212 ), reduced neutrophil levels ( 80548 ), antioxidant effects ( 78982 , 79295 , 79539 , 79552 , 79555 , 80203 , 80909 , 80956 ), effects on NF-kappa B cell signaling ( 79555 ), protection of the anti-inflammatory protein histone deacetylase-2 ( 80322 ), and decreased nitric oxide synthase activity ( 78982 , 80417 , 80956 ). Skin effects In human research, taking curcumin was found to reduce pruritus severity ( 81120 , 81176 , 89724 ). Also, topical curcumin was of benefit in patients with skin lesions due to cancer ( 11148 ). Topical curcumin is commonly used for various skin conditions. Potential benefits of turmeric have been shown in animal models of skin damage, such as chronic ultraviolet B (UVB)-irradiated skin damage ( 80716 ). Benefits have included prevention of skin thickness increase and prevention of reduction in skin elasticity and the formation of wrinkles ( 80716 ). The inhibition of NF-kappaB may play a role in curcumin-induced beneficial effects in keratinocytes ( 79154 ). Would healing may also be improved. In animal research, topical curcumin increased cellular proliferation and collagen synthesis and crosslinking at the wound site, resulting in faster healing and increased tensile strength ( 79884 ). In the wound bed, curcumin resulted in alterations of TGF-beta and increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( 79213 ). Weight loss effects Curcumin may have a beneficial effect in obesity through downregulation of Janus kinase, which is thought to have a role in the pathogenesis of obesity, and inhibition of an enzyme that activates cortisol in adipocytes, playing a role in central obesity. Curcumin may also inhibit adipocyte differentiation through suppression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), and enhance monophosphate activated protein kinase and lipolysis ( 102345 ).",

Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, taking turmeric with antidiabetes drugs might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Animal research and case reports suggest that curcumin, a turmeric constituent, can reduce blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes ( 79692 , 79984 , 80155 , 80313 , 80315 , 80476 , 80553 , 81048 , 81219 ).
