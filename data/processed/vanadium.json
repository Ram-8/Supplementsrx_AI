  "overview_text": "Vanadium is a trace mineral. It is regularly consumed in the diet and is found in mushrooms, shellfish, black pepper, parsley, dillseed, grains and grain products, and beverages such as beer, wine, and artificially sweetened drinks. Drinking water can also contain trace amounts of vanadium.",
  "effectiveness_text": "Expand All | Collapse All Likely Effective Vanadium deficiency. Oral vanadium is effective for the prevention of vanadium deficiency. Taking vanadium is effective for preventing vanadium deficiency ( 7135 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Athletic performance. Although there has been interest in using oral vanadium for improving athletic performance, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vanadium for this purpose. Cancer. Although there has been interest in using oral vanadium for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vanadium for this purpose. Diabetes. Small clinical studies suggest that high doses of oral vanadium may improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes; however, these high doses may be unsafe. It is unclear if lower doses of vanadium have the same effects. Five very small clinical studies including fewer than 40 patients with type 2 diabetes show that taking high oral doses of vanadyl sulfate (50-75 mg twice daily; 31-46 mg elemental vanadium daily) for up to 6 weeks can improve hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity and might reduce blood glucose levels when compared to baseline ( 3055 , 3056 , 3057 , 12557 , 12558 ). However, prolonged use of these high doses might not be safe ( 7135 ). It is not known if lower doses have the same benefit. more Hyperlipidemia. Although there has been interest in using oral vanadium for hyperlipidemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vanadium for this purpose. Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral vanadium is beneficial in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. A very small clinical study in overweight or obese adults with impaired glucose tolerance shows that taking vanadyl sulfate 50 mg twice daily for 30 days does not improve insulin sensitivity or glucose metabolism when compared with placebo ( 92819 ). more Tuberculosis. Although there has been interest in using oral vanadium for tuberculosis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vanadium for this purpose. More evidence is needed to rate vanadium for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Vanadium is safe when taken in amounts below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1.8 mg daily ( 7135 ). Possibly Unsafe when used orally in high doses. Taking more than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1.8 mg daily can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and theoretically, kidney toxicity ( 7135 ). In some cases, patients with diabetes have used very high doses (100 mg daily) safely for up to 4 weeks ( 3055 , 3056 , 3057 ). However, there is concern that prolonged use of high doses might cause serious side effects including kidney damage ( 7135 ). Doses of 22.5 mg daily for five months can cause cramps and diarrhea ( 3012 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts found in foods ( 7135 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of vanadium when used in amounts greater than those typically found in foods. PREGNANCY: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts found in foods ( 7135 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in medicinal amounts. Epidemiological research has found that increased urinary levels of vanadium are associated with an increased risk of both term and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM). When comparing tertiles of urinary vanadium levels, patients in the middle tertile had 1.66 times the risk of term PROM when compared with the lowest tertile, and those in the highest tertile had 3.75 times the risk. For preterm PROM (rupture prior to 37 weeks' gestation), those in the highest tertile had an 8.14 times increased risk when compared with those in the lowest tertile ( 99052 ). Epidemiological research has also found that higher prenatal serum levels of vanadium are associated with impaired fetal growth, particularly in male newborns. The risk appears greatest with vanadium exposure in the second trimester ( 102096 ). LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts found in foods ( 7135 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of vanadium when used in amounts greater than those typically found in foods; avoid using.",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: The vanadyl sulfate form of vanadium is most often used at a dose of 50 mg twice daily for up to 4 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. The National Institute of Medicine has set the tolerable upper intake level (UL) at 1.8 mg daily of elemental vanadium for adults ( 7135 ). An average diet provides 6-18 mcg vanadium daily ( 7135 ). Children Oral: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. No recommended dietary allowance (RDA) or tolerable upper intake level (UL) has been set for infants and children. Vanadium intake should be limited to what is found naturally in food or infant formula ( 7135 ). Standardization & Formulation Vanadium supplements are available in various salt forms. Vanadyl sulfate contains 31% elemental vanadium. Sodium metavanadate contains 42% elemental vanadium. Sodium orthovanadate contains 28% elemental vanadium ( 16 ). The vanadium pentoxide form, which is considered toxic, is not found in foods or supplements.",

  "mechanism_text": "General Vanadium is a trace mineral. Good dietary sources of vanadium include mushrooms, shellfish, black pepper, parsley, dill seed, grains and grain products, and beverages such as beer, wine, and artificially sweetened drinks ( 7135 ). Drinking water can also contain trace amounts of vanadium ( 3011 ). An average diet provides 6 to 18 mcg vanadium daily. Antidiabetes effects Some evidence suggests that vanadium can mimic the actions of insulin, possibly by causing phosphorylation of insulin receptor proteins. Vanadium activates the receptor, stimulates glucose oxidation and transport, inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue, stimulates glycogen synthesis in the liver, inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis, inhibits intestinal glucose transport; and increases glucose uptake, utilization, and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle ( 3012 , 3013 ). It appears to augment the effects of insulin in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes, but might not have an effect in type 1 diabetes ( 482 ). Preliminary evidence suggests that L-glutamic acid gamma-monohydroxamate might activate endogenous vanadium, facilitating glucose metabolism through conversion of intracellular vanadium into an active insulinomimetic compound ( 388 ). Bone effects Vanadium appears to be important in normal bone growth and as a cofactor for various enzyme reactions. Vanadium inhibits ATPases, phosphatases, and phosphoryl-transfer enzymes ( 7135 ). Cardiovascular effects Vanadium seems to have cardiovascular effects. There is some evidence that prolonged administration might be associated with dose-dependent increases in blood pressure ( 3012 ). Vanadium also inhibits cholesterol synthesis from mevalonic acid ( 3012 ). Dental effects There is some evidence that vanadium might protect against dental caries ( 3012 ).",
