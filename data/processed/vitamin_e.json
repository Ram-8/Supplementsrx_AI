  "overview_text": "Vitamin E is an essential fat-soluble vitamin. In 1925, vitamin E was recognized as the fifth vitamin. Due to its effects on fertility, it was named tocopherol, based on the Greek words toc and phero, which mean child and to bring forth, respectively. It occurs naturally in many foods including vegetable oils, wheat germ oil, cereal grains, animal fats, meat, poultry, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. Vitamin E exists as two distinct chemical analogues: tocopherols and tocotrienols. Tocopherols are saturated vitamin E derivatives, while tocotrienols are unsaturated vitamin E derivatives that possess an isoprenoid side chain. Each isomer may have a different role in the action of vitamin E. This monograph focuses on vitamin E provided as tocopherols.",
  "effectiveness_text": "Expand All | Collapse All Effective Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED). Oral vitamin E is effective for treating vitamin E deficiency due to the genetic disorder AVED. This genetic disorder occurs when the gene that produces alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) is defective. This causes severe vitamin E deficiency. Symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, absence of deep tendon reflexes, and sensory loss usually appear between 4 and 18 years of age. Vitamin E supplements are used in the treatment of AVED ( 13498 , 101437 , 101438 ). more Vitamin E deficiency. Oral vitamin E is effective for preventing or treating vitamin E deficiency and associated conditions. Taking vitamin E orally is effective for preventing and treating vitamin E deficiency ( 4844 ). However, vitamin E deficiency is rare in humans. It most commonly occurs in people with malabsorption disorders such as abetalipoproteinemia; cystic fibrosis; gastrectomy; hepatic-biliary tract disease including chronic cholestasis, hepatic cirrhosis, biliary atresia, and obstructive jaundice; in infants receiving formula with insufficient vitamin E; intestinal diseases including celiac and tropical sprue; and regional enteritis ( 4844 , 104411 ). more Possibly Effective Alzheimer disease. Oral vitamin E might slow functional decline in some patients with this condition. However, it does not seem to prevent Alzheimer disease onset. A clinical study in patients with moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 2000 IU daily for 2 years might be similar to selegiline (Eldepryl), and superior to placebo, for slowing cognitive decline. Benefit was only apparent when outcomes were adjusted for baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. This study is limited by attrition bias, or incomplete outcome reporting ( 4635 , 97070 ). Another clinical study in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol 2000 IU daily reduces the annual rate of decline in activities of daily living by 19% when compared with placebo. This translates to a delay in disease progression of 6.2 months. This is comparable to the effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., rivastigmine) in this population. Despite these positive findings, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends against the use of vitamin E for the management of dementia due to the increased risk for adverse effects with the extended use of high-dose vitamin E ( 104823 ). Interestingly, the combination of vitamin E and memantine (Namenda) 20 mg per day is not superior to placebo in this population. Researchers speculate that this lack of effectiveness may be due to an interaction between vitamin E and memantine, but this proposed interaction has not been validated in research ( 19060 , 97070 ). Vitamin E supplementation doesn't seem to prevent Alzheimer disease or slow progression of mild cognitive impairment. Patients with mild cognitive impairment who take vitamin E 2000 IU daily for 3 years progress to Alzheimer disease at the same rate as those who take placebo ( 13060 , 97070 ). Furthermore, although population research has found that greater intake of foods high in vitamin E is associated with a lower risk of developing Alzheimer disease ( 34597 , 90082 ), taking vitamin E supplements does not seem to help. Evidence from a large clinical study that was later converted into an observational study shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU orally daily does not prevent Alzheimer disease when compared with placebo in cognitively intact men ( 93570 ). However, this study is limited by the fact that the participants were well-educated and were assessed for dementia in their 60s; the prevalence of dementia is typically low in this age group ( 93571 ). more Beta-thalassemia. Oral vitamin E seems to be beneficial for children with this condition. A small clinical study in children with beta-thalassemia and low vitamin E plasma concentrations shows that taking vitamin E orally seems to correct erythrocyte membrane abnormalities when compared with control ( 4642 ). Another small clinical trial in children 5-18 years of age with beta-thalassemia shows that taking an age-based dose of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 200-600 mg daily for 4 weeks seems to increase haptoglobin levels, suggesting reduced hemolysis, when compared with placebo ( 104412 ). more Dysmenorrhea. Oral vitamin E seems to reduce pain in adults with dysmenorrhea. Small clinical studies in younger adults with primary dysmenorrhea show that taking vitamin E 200-500 IU daily, starting 2 days before menstruation and continuing through the first 3 days of bleeding for 2-4 cycles, decreases the severity and duration of pain and reduces blood loss when compared with placebo ( 10361 , 14432 , 99367 ). One study also shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU with fish oil provides better pain relief when compared with taking either vitamin E or omega-3 fatty acids alone ( 99367 ). A meta-analysis of 8 small clinical studies, including those described above, in individuals with dysmenorrhea shows that taking vitamin E reduces the severity of pain when compared with placebo ( 112170 ). more Exercise-induced muscle damage. Oral vitamin E seems to modestly reduce exercise-induced muscle damage. A meta-analysis of 17 very small clinical studies in trained and untrained adults shows that taking vitamin E 300-1200 IU daily for up to 12 weeks reduces markers of exercise-induced muscle damage, including creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, when compared with placebo. Vitamin E appears to be most beneficial in athletes and at doses under 500 IU daily ( 112160 ). However, a small clinical study in endurance-trained runners, not included in the analysis above, shows that taking vitamin E (as alpha-tocopherol) 235 mg and vitamin C 1000 mg 2 hours prior to an exercise protocol does not reduce delayed onset muscle soreness or improve markers of exercise-induced muscle damage when compared with placebo ( 109961 ). more Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Oral vitamin E seems to be beneficial in patients with G6PD deficiency. Individual clinical studies evaluating the use of vitamin E in patients with G6PD deficiency show mixed results ( 4682 , 4683 , 4684 ). However, a meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies in patients with G6PD deficiency shows that taking vitamin E improves hemoglobin levels and reduces reticulocyte levels when compared with placebo in the setting of both acute and chronic hemolysis ( 112164 ). more Intracranial hemorrhage. Oral vitamin E might reduce the risk of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants. Clinical research shows that giving premature neonates vitamin E orally might reduce the risk of intracranial hemorrhage when compared with control ( 4655 , 85074 ). more Intraventricular hemorrhage. Oral vitamin E might reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants. Intravenous vitamin E does not provide this benefit. A meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that oral, but not intravenous, administration of vitamin E can reduce the risk for intraventricular hemorrhage in premature neonates when compared with control. However, it might not reduce the risk for severe (grade III-IV) intraventricular hemorrhage. Additionally, high serum levels of vitamin E have been associated with an increased risk for sepsis in premature infants ( 85062 ). more Nitrate tolerance. Oral vitamin E might reduce tolerance to nitrates. Nitrate tolerance might involve increased vascular superoxide anion production, and antioxidants may help prevent this ( 4705 ). Clinical research in patients with ischemic heart disease shows that taking vitamin E 447-894 IU daily can help prevent nitrate tolerance when compared with placebo ( 4705 , 11543 ). more Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Oral vitamin E seems to improve outcomes in patients with NASH. Clinical studies and meta-analyses in adults with NASH shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU daily for up to 24 months improves liver enzymes, hepatic fibrosis, steatosis, and lobular inflammation ( 14005 , 17517 , 97077 , 104413 ). Taking vitamin E 400-1200 IU in children with NASH also seems to improve liver enzyme levels after 4-10 months of treatment ( 89 ). Furthermore, a small study in patients with NASH shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU daily for 1 year seems to improve liver histology to a similar degree as taking telmisartan 40 mg daily ( 104405 ). In fact, practice guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommend taking vitamin E 800 IU daily as a first-line therapy in non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH. However, vitamin E isn't recommended in NASH patients with diabetes, cirrhosis, or cryptogenic cirrhosis ( 98130 ). more Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Oral vitamin E seems to improve PMS symptoms. Clinical research in adults with PMS shows that taking vitamin E 400-600 IU daily for 3 cycles reduce subjective reports of symptoms, including anxiety, craving, and depression, when compared with placebo ( 4719 , 4720 ). Another small clinical study in Japanese patients with PMS shows that taking vitamin E, as gamma-tocopherol 180 mg, twice daily for 7 days during the luteal phase of 2 consecutive cycles reduces fatigue, irritability, and leg swelling when compared with placebo ( 112337 ). more Tardive dyskinesia. Oral vitamin E might attenuate worsening of tardive dyskinesia in patients taking antipsychotic medications. Small clinical studies suggest that taking vitamin E orally improves Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores in patients with tardive dyskinesia. It seems to be more effective in higher doses and in people who have had tardive dyskinesia for less than 5 years ( 3942 , 3943 , 3944 , 3945 , 3946 , 3948 , 85323 ). Both RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) and unspecified forms were used in clinical trials. However, some conflicting findings have been reported. A meta-analysis suggests that vitamin E does not improve symptoms of tardive dyskinesia when compared with placebo; however, taking vitamin E seems to prevent the deterioration of symptoms when compared with placebo ( 97079 ). more Possibly Ineffective Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Oral vitamin E does not seem to slow AMD progression. Results from clinical trials and meta-analyses of clinical trials show that vitamin E when taken alone or in combination with other antioxidants does not prevent the development ( 4667 , 7303 , 7304 , 34625 ) or progression of AMD ( 34633 ). In contrast, taking vitamin E 400 IU orally with elemental zinc 80 mg, vitamin C 500 mg, and beta-carotene 15 mg daily does seem to be beneficial. When taken for 5 years, this combination reduces visual acuity loss and reduces the risk of progression of AMD by 25% in patients with advanced AMD ( 7303 , 11326 ). A 10-year follow-up on this study confirmed these findings ( 90069 ). It is not known if this combination is beneficial for people with less advanced macular disease or for preventing AMD. Additionally, it is not clear if this benefit is due to vitamin E, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Oral vitamin E does not seem to slow ALS progression. Clinical research in patients with ALS shows that taking alpha-tocopherol 1490 IU daily for up to 12 months in addition to riluzole does not influence survival or motor function when compared with riluzole alone. However, these patients seem to be less likely to progress to a more severe disease state from a milder disease state ( 83180 ). Additionally, a large population study has found that dietary intake of vitamin E is not associated with risk of developing ALS ( 90087 ). more Angina. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce angina symptoms. Clinical research shows that taking vitamin E orally may have some effect on endothelial dysfunction, but does not improve angina in nonsmokers or smokers, when compared with placebo ( 3896 , 4634 , 4649 , 4650 , 4651 , 4652 ). more Atherosclerosis. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce atherosclerosis progression. Taking RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) orally does not appear to have any effect on atherosclerosis progression or mortality in patients with atherosclerosis when compared with placebo ( 3899 , 3936 ). However, there is preliminary evidence that a combination of vitamin E and vitamin C might help prevent the progression of atherosclerosis in men, particularly smokers and cardiac transplant patients ( 1918 ). more Atopic dermatitis (eczema). Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce eczema symptoms. Clinical research shows that taking vitamin E 600 IU in combination with selenium daily for 12 weeks does not improve symptoms of atopic eczema when compared with placebo or selenium alone ( 74456 ). Also, while some clinical research shows that taking 600 IU of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) daily for 60 days with vitamin D 1600 IU improves overall atopic dermatitis symptoms, pruritus, and erythema when compared with placebo, taking vitamin E alone does not seem to have this effect. However, vitamin E alone does improve hard, leathery skin symptoms and dryness when compared with placebo ( 84491 ). more Breast cancer-related hot flashes. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce hot flashes related to breast cancer. Clinical research shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU daily for 4 weeks does not reduce hot flashes in females who have had breast cancer when compared with placebo ( 454 ). more Bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. Clinical research in premature infants weighing less than 1500 grams at birth shows that taking vitamin E orally does not prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia when compared with placebo ( 4657 , 85062 ). more Cataracts. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce cataract risk. Some population research has found that dietary and supplemental vitamin E intake is associated with a reduced risk of developing age-related cataracts ( 4208 , 4663 , 4665 , 4759 ). However, other population research has not found this association ( 2395 , 4664 , 92902 ). Additionally, higher quality evidence from clinical trials and a meta-analysis consistently shows that vitamin E, taken alone or with other vitamins, does not prevent the progression of age-related cataracts or decrease vision loss when compared with control ( 4666 , 7304 , 34626 ). However, a meta-analysis of observational research suggests that higher dietary intake of vitamin E is weakly associated with a 27% reduction in the odds of developing cataracts when compared with low dietary intake of vitamin E ( 112095 ). more Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce peripheral neuropathy due to chemotherapy. Although some small, low-quality clinical studies and a meta-analysis of these studies suggest that vitamin E 600 mg daily for 3 months might be beneficial for preventing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy induced by cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin when compared with placebo ( 10366 , 85117 , 90072 ), these studies have found no effect with lower doses of vitamin E or in those receiving paclitaxel chemotherapy ( 107862 ). In addition to the low methodological quality of the studies, the validity of these finding is limited by high heterogeneity, as the studies included patients with several different cancer types. Also, a large, high-quality clinical study shows that taking vitamin E 400 mg daily is not beneficial for preventing peripheral neuropathy induced by taxanes or platinum analogues when compared with placebo ( 101457 ). The American Society of Clinical Oncology does not recommend the use of vitamin E for the prevention or management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( 101434 ). more Colorectal cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce colorectal cancer risk. Some population research has found that intake of vitamin E and multivitamins is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer ( 1047 ). Some preliminary clinical research also shows that taking vitamin E orally in combination with other vitamins might have a protective effect in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas ( 3954 , 3956 , 92903 ). However, higher quality evidence from larger clinical trials and meta-analyses of clinical research consistently show that taking vitamin E supplements alone, or in combination with other vitamins, does not prevent colorectal cancer incidence or recurrence when compared with control ( 3953 , 3955 , 3957 , 12185 , 13036 , 13131 , 34594 , 90361 ). Despite this conflicting research, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim in 2009 regarding vitamin E and colorectal cancer risk. However, the FDA has determined that it is highly unlikely that vitamin E supplements reduce the risk of colorectal cancer ( 102332 ). more Congestive heart failure (CHF). Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce CHF symptoms or prevent CHF development. Clinical research in adults with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV heart failure shows that taking vitamin E (RRR- α tocopherol) 500 IU orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve prognostic or functional indices of CHF or quality of life measurements when compared with placebo ( 3906 ). Additionally, population research shows that taking vitamin E 600 IU every other day does not affect the risk of developing heart failure in healthy females 45 years or older when compared with placebo ( 90068 ). more Head and neck cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of head and neck cancer recurrence. In fact, it might increase recurrence risk. A large clinical trial in patients with stage I or II head and neck cancer shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 400 IU daily, during radiation therapy and for 3 years after the end of radiation therapy, does not reduce the risk of recurrence of the first tumor or development of a second primary tumor when compared with placebo. In fact, there is some concern that patients taking vitamin E seem to have an increased risk of tumor recurrence or a second primary tumor when compared with patients taking placebo ( 13055 ). Advise patients with head and neck cancer to avoid taking vitamin E supplements in doses of 400 IU/day or more. more Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Oral vitamin E during pregnancy does not seem to reduce IUGR risk. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E along with other ingredients throughout pregnancy does not reduce the risk for IUGR when compared with placebo ( 97075 ). more Liver disease. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce liver disease-associated mortality. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E does not reduce all-cause-or liver related-mortality or morbidity in patients with liver diseases, including autoimmune liver diseases, viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis ( 34608 ). Additional clinical research in male smokers over 50 years old shows that taking vitamin E 75 IU orally, alone or with beta-carotene 20 mg orally, daily for 5-8 years does not reduce the risk of mortality due to chronic liver disease when compared with placebo ( 91383 ). more Oral leukoplakia. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk for oral leukoplakia in male smokers. Although there is some conflicting evidence ( 3951 , 4708 ), the largest randomized controlled trial indicates that supplementation with all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 55.6 IU daily for 5-7 years has no effect on the incidence of oral lesions in male cigarette smokers when compared with placebo ( 3951 ). more Osteoarthritis. Oral vitamin E does not seem to be beneficial for osteoarthritis treatment or prevention. Taking vitamin E 500 IU daily for 6 months does not seem to decrease symptoms of pain or stiffness in patients with osteoarthritis when compared with placebo ( 5264 ). Additional clinical research show that taking vitamin E 500 IU daily for up to 2 years does not slow cartilage loss when compared with placebo ( 13066 ). Population research has shown that taking vitamin E supplements does not reduce the risk of developing osteoarthritis or slow the progression of existing osteoarthritis ( 5881 ). more Pancreatic cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce pancreatic cancer risk. Taking vitamin E supplements alone or in combination with other antioxidants such as beta-carotene and vitamin C does not reduce the risk of developing pancreatic cancer ( 12185 , 85147 ). Taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 55.6 IU daily for 5 to 8 years also does not seem to reduce the incidence of or mortality from carcinoma of the pancreas in male smokers ( 3961 ). more Parkinson disease. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce Parkinson disease symptoms or progression, although the risk of developing the disease may decrease with increased dietary vitamin E intake. Observational research has found that dietary vitamin E intake might be associated with a decreased occurrence of Parkinson disease ( 4712 ). A meta-analysis of 12 studies evaluating the risk of developing Parkinson disease has found that the highest daily intake of vitamin E is associated with a 20% lower risk than those with the lowest intake ( 107858 ). However, clinical research in patients with stage I or II Parkinson disease shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 2000 IU daily for up to 24 months doesn't seem to have any benefit when compared with baseline or control ( 4709 , 4710 , 4711 , 85318 ). more Pharyngeal cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces the risk of developing cancer of the pharynx. A sub-group analysis of a large-scale clinical trial (The HOPE Trial) in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease suggests that taking RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 400 IU daily for about 7 years is not linked with a reduced risk of developing oral or pharyngeal cancer when compared with placebo ( 13036 ). more Pre-eclampsia. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce pre-eclampsia risk. The majority of clinical research shows that taking a combination of vitamins E and C, at the same doses, does not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia in low-, moderate-, or high-risk patients, when compared with placebo or no treatment. Also, the risk of gestational hypertension might increase in some cases, although results are inconsistent ( 83312 , 83356 , 83383 , 83472 , 83474 , 97075 , 97059 ). Other researchers using vitamin E in combination with vitamin C and allopurinol beginning at 24-32 weeks gestation found the combination similar to placebo ( 4718 ). However, some clinical research suggests that taking a combination of vitamin E 400 IU and vitamin C 1000 mg daily reduces the risk of proteinuric hypertension in high-risk patients when started in weeks 16-22 of pregnancy ( 3236 ). more Preterm labor. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce risk for premature labor. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E along with other ingredients throughout pregnancy does not reduce the risk for preterm labor when compared with placebo ( 97075 ). more Prostate cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. A meta-analysis of over 30 large clinical trials and observational studies shows that neither dietary nor supplemental vitamin E reduces the risk of prostate cancer when compared with a control ( 112159 ). However, individual study results are mixed. Population research on the use of dietary or supplemental vitamin E intake for prostate cancer risk reduction is conflicting ( 12872 , 14124 , 12873 , 15607 ). Although one large-scale study in smokers found that taking 55.6 IU daily of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) reduced the risk of prostate cancer and mortality ( 3959 , 11303 ), most large-scale randomized, controlled trials show that vitamin E is not beneficial. A sub-group analysis of a large-scale clinical study (The HOPE trial) in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease suggests that taking 400 IU of RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) daily for about 7 years is not linked with a decreased risk of developing prostate cancer when compared with placebo ( 13036 ). Another large scale study (Physician's Health Study II) shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU every other day for an average of 8 years does not reduce the risk of prostate cancer when compared with placebo ( 16708 , 90097 ). Similarly, another large clinical study (The SU.VI.MAX study) shows that a combination of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 44.7 IU, vitamin C 120 mg, beta-carotene 6 mg, selenium 100 mcg, and zinc 20 mg daily for an average of 8 years does not reduce the risk of prostate cancer overall when compared with placebo ( 14135 ). A fourth large-scale clinical trial (The SELECT trial) in men over the age of 50 years shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 400 IU daily, alone or in combination with selenium 200 mcg daily, for an average of about 5.5 years does not reduce prostate cancer risk when compared with placebo ( 16707 ). Also, an extension of this initial study found that taking vitamin E alone was associated with a 17% increased of developing prostate cancer ( 17688 ). more Respiratory tract infections. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce respiratory infections in most patients. However, there's some evidence that it might reduce incidence of the common cold in patients living in long-term care facilities. Taking oral vitamin E 298 IU daily, alone or in supplemental multivitamin form, does not appear to decrease the incidence, duration, or severity of upper or lower respiratory infections in elderly persons when compared with placebo ( 10788 , 12094 ). However, some research shows that taking vitamin E reduces the incidence of the common cold in elderly long-term care patients when compared with placebo ( 12094 ). More evidence is needed to determine how effective vitamin E might be for reducing the incidence of the common cold. more Retinitis pigmentosa. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce retinitis pigmentosa and related visual decline. Taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) orally does not appear to slow visual decline is people with retinitis pigmentosa and has been associated with more rapid loss of visual acuity, although the validity of the study with these findings has been questioned ( 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 ). more Scarring. Topical vitamin E does not seem to improve scar appearance. Some clinical research shows that applying ointment containing vitamin E topically does not reduce surgical wound scarring when compared with a placebo ointment ( 4721 , 4722 ). more Stillbirth. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce risk of a stillborn baby. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E along with other ingredients during pregnancy does not reduce the risk for stillbirth when compared with placebo ( 97075 ). more Likely Ineffective Breast cancer. Oral vitamin E does not reduce breast cancer risk. Some evidence suggests that higher serum levels of vitamin E might be associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer ( 10132 ). However, increasing vitamin E intake from the diet or supplements does not seem to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer ( 4658 , 4659 , 85147 , 112334 ). Also, a large-scale randomized trial in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease shows that patients who take 400 IU of RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) daily do not have a reduced risk of developing breast cancer ( 13036 ). In other large-scale studies, females who take RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 600 IU every other day for up to 10 years also do not have a lower risk of developing breast cancer ( 13131 , 34580 ). more Cancer. Oral vitamin E does not reduce the risk of cancer in most patients. Some research suggests that a combination of vitamin E 44.7 IU daily with vitamin C, beta-carotene, selenium, and zinc does not lower the overall risk of cancer, although it might reduce the risk of cancer when only males are evaluated ( 14109 ). However, clinical research from a large scale study (Physician's Health Study II) shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU every other day for an average of 8 years does not reduce the overall risk of cancer in males when compared with placebo ( 16708 , 90097 ). Also, clinical research published in a meta-analysis shows that taking vitamin E does not reduce the overall risk of cancer ( 85147 ). In 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding antioxidant vitamins, such as vitamin E and overall cancer risk. However, the FDA has determined that the evidence is limited and inconclusive ( 102334 ). The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) states that there is no net benefit to supplementation with vitamin E for the prevention of cancer in general and therefore recommends against its use ( 108641 , 112166 ). more Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most evidence shows that oral vitamin E does not reduce the risk for CVD events or complications. Most clinical research in various populations shows that taking vitamin E supplements orally is not effective for preventing heart disease or adverse cardiovascular outcomes such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, hospitalizations for unstable angina, morbidity, or cardiovascular death ( 12492 , 12493 , 13036 , 14108 , 66140 , 83050 , 85084 , 85224 ). The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) states that there is no net benefit to supplementation with vitamin E for the prevention of CVD in general and therefore recommends against its use ( 108641 , 112166 ). With few exceptions ( 3357 , 3936 ), large-scale controlled clinical trials show that vitamin E supplements offer no benefit for primary prevention in healthy or high-risk patients ( 3907 , 3935 , 3937 , 13036 , 13131 ), or for secondary prevention of heart disease and cardiovascular events such as MI, stroke, and death ( 3896 , 3899 , 13036 ). While one analysis of clinical research found that in mostly healthy patients 70 years or younger without CVD, vitamin E supplementation reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality, the authors performed more than 20 statistical tests and did not adjust for multiple comparisons. Therefore, it possible that the positive effect was due to chance. This analysis was also limited because it excluded adults older than 70 years of age and adults that are more likely to suffer an exacerbation from a chronic condition. Furthermore, the analysis showed that vitamin E supplementation does not reduce the risk of all-cause mortality or the risk of CVD compared with placebo or no intervention ( 97078 ). There's additional conflicting evidence. One large-scale trial shows that healthy females who take RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 600 IU every other day for up to 10 years also do not have a lower risk of major cardiovascular events but might have a 24% lower risk of cardiovascular death when compared with placebo ( 13131 ). This finding is contradictory to previous findings. One notable limitation of this trial is a lack of systematic assessment of the use of statins or other cardiovascular therapies by the participants throughout the 10-year period. Meta-analyses of clinical trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes and the haptoglobin 2-2 genotype show that taking vitamin E, up to 600 IU daily for up to 8 years, reduces the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction and death due to CVD ( 85179 , 85221 ). Because these meta-analyses included only specific patients, the generalizability of the results is questionable. There is debate about whether some forms of vitamin E might work differently than others. Some people suggest that RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) is more effective than all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E). This has not been verified by studies. A meta-analysis of vitamin E studies indicates that there is no significant difference in cardiovascular outcomes based on the form of vitamin E used ( 13132 ). The FDA has refused to allow labeling claims for vitamin E supplements for prevention of CVD ( 3939 ). A Science Advisory from the American Heart Association also states that the evidence doesn't justify use of antioxidants such as vitamin E for reducing the risk of CVD ( 12142 ). Advise patients not to rely on vitamin E supplements for preventing heart disease. more Fetal and premature infant mortality. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce death in preterm infants. Meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking vitamin E throughout pregnancy does not affect morbidity or mortality in preterm infants when compared with placebo ( 85074 , 97075 ). more Fibrocystic breast disease. Oral vitamin E does not improve fibrocystic breast disease in most patients. Clinical research shows that taking alpha-tocopherol 150 IU, 300 IU, or 600 IU daily for 2-3 months does not improve subjective or objective measures of fibrocystic breast disease when compared with placebo ( 4660 , 4661 , 4662 ). more Lung cancer. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce lung cancer risk. Taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 55.6 IU daily for 5-8 years is not associated with a lower risk of developing lung cancer for male smokers ( 3949 ). A sub-group analysis of a large scale clinical trial in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease who take RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 400 IU daily for about 7 years do not have a lower risk of developing lung cancer when compared with placebo ( 13036 ). In another large-scale study, females who take RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 600 IU every other day for up to 10 years also do not have a lower risk of developing lung cancer ( 13131 ). Meta-analyses of clinical research suggest taking vitamin E as alpha-tocopherol for up to approximately 10 years does not prevent lung cancer or reduce the incidence of lung cancer mortality when compared with placebo ( 34632 , 85147 ). However, a large epidemiological cancer screening trial with a mean follow-up of over 12 years suggests that higher dietary intake of vitamin E, but not total intake or supplementation with vitamin E, is associated with a modest reduction in development of lung cancer ( 112096 ). more Overall mortality. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of mortality from all causes. Although some population research suggests that increased dietary vitamin E intake is associated with reduced overall mortality ( 98260 ), most meta-analyses of clinical research in adults show that taking vitamin E supplements for at least 1 year does not affect all-cause mortality ( 34622 , 85164 , 85200 ). Furthermore, when only high quality clinical trials were analyzed, mortality was increased by 3% in adults taking vitamin E when compared with control ( 34622 ). more Prematurity. Oral vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of premature birth and complications. Clinical research shows that vitamin E does not improve blood parameters or prevent the development of anemia in premature infants ( 4648 , 10362 ). One clinical study in premature infants weighing less than 1500 grams at birth shows that giving vitamin E 25 IU daily for six weeks does not improve hemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte counts, or platelet counts when compared with placebo ( 4648 ). Another clinical study in premature infants weighing less than 1250 grams at birth shows that giving vitamin E 50 IU daily for eight weeks does not increase the response to erythropoietin and iron when compared with placebo ( 10362 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Aging skin. Topical vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in Asian females aged 30-65 years shows that applying a specific liquid product, (Antioxidant and Collagen Booster Serum, Max Biocare Pty Ltd.) containing vitamin E 1%, vitamin C 20%, and red raspberry leaf cell culture extract 0.0005%, to the face nightly for 8 weeks, in addition to regular facial skin products, improves skin color, elasticity, radiance, smoothness, and appearance of wrinkles when compared with regular facial skin products alone ( 102355 ). more Aluminum phosphide poisoning. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in the management of aluminum phosphide poisoning. A small clinical study in patients in Iran admitted to the intensive care unit with aluminum phosphide poisoning shows that administering vitamin E 400 mg intramuscularly twice daily reduces malondialdehyde levels, mechanical ventilation duration, and mortality when compared with supportive care alone ( 114119 ). more Anemia of chronic disease. Small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin E might improve response to anemia treatment in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Two small studies in adults and children on chronic hemodialysis have shown improved response to erythropoietin with vitamin E supplementation ( 4640 , 4647 ). In one study, children given vitamin E 22.4 IU/kg in combination with erythropoietin had significantly increased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels after 2 weeks of combination treatment, compared with eight and five weeks in patients receiving erythropoietin alone ( 4640 ). In a study of adults, concurrent supplementation with vitamin E 745 IU daily allowed dose reductions of erythropoietin from an average of 93 U/kg/week to 74 U/kg/week with the same resultant hemoglobin levels ( 4647 ). more Anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with breast cancer receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy shows that taking vitamin E 600 mg three times daily and L-carnitine 3000 mg by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by 300 mg by mouth four times daily thereafter for 3 weeks reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 63% and improved laboratory markers of cardiotoxicity when compared with chemotherapy alone ( 112338 ). It is unclear if these findings are due to vitamin E, L-carnitine, or the combination. more Anxiety. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with anxiety. A meta-analysis of 5 mostly small clinical studies in patients without anxiety shows that taking vitamin E 200-400 IU daily for up to 10 weeks does not improve anxiety symptom scores when compared with placebo ( 112158 ). It is unclear if these findings can be generalized to patients with anxiety disorders. more Asthma. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for asthma treatment or prevention. There is inconsistent evidence about the role of vitamin E in asthma. Some population research has found that increased dietary intake of vitamin E is associated with a lower risk of asthma; however taking vitamin E supplements are not associated with decreased risk ( 6058 , 15006 ). Low vitamin E intake also appears to be associated with an increased risk of asthma ( 315 , 401 , 422 ). A small clinical study in children with asthma suggests that adding vitamin E 74.5 IU by mouth daily to fluticasone treatment for 8 weeks may decrease cough, wheezing, and dyspnea when compared with baseline ( 90077 ). This study was limited because it did not compare the vitamin E intervention to the control group. more Atopic disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces the risk of atopic disease in infants. Population research has found that increased maternal vitamin E intake isn't associated with decreased odds of developing eczema, food allergy, wheeze, allergic sensitization, or any allergic disease in infants ( 90098 ). more Bladder cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces bladder cancer risk. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that the highest intake of vitamin E is associated with a reduced risk for bladder cancer when compared to the lowest intake in patients followed for more than 10 years. This benefit was not seen in those followed for less than 10 years. This effect appears to be dose-dependent, although it is not clear how much vitamin E intake is required to reduce bladder cancer risk. Additionally, it is not clear whether this benefit differs for dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin E ( 101435 ). Population research also suggests that regular use of vitamin E supplements for more than 10 years is associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer mortality; however, use for less than 10 years is not associated with reduced mortality ( 9839 ). In 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding vitamin E and bladder cancer risk. However, the FDA has determined that it is highly unlikely that vitamin E supplements reduce the risk of bladder cancer ( 102332 ). A moderate-sized clinical study in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU orally daily for an average of 1.5 years increases the risk of recurrence, but not progression or death, when compared with placebo ( 114116 ). more Burns. It is unclear if topical vitamin E is beneficial for healing of burn wounds. A small clinical study in patients with moderate and deep burn wounds (25% to 67%) shows that applying a specific alpha-tocopherol product (Filme Olio) daily seems to reduce infection and improve healing when compared with usual treatment ( 104407 ). more Carpal tunnel syndrome. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking a combination product containing vitamin E, alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, and other ingredients orally twice daily for 60 days reduces symptom severity and pain, but does not improve measures of hand and wrist function, when compared with control ( 111702 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin E, other ingredients, or the combination. more Chemotherapy-related infection. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with infection due to chemotherapy. Observational research suggests that greater dietary intake of vitamin E may lower the incidence of infection in children undergoing chemotherapy for lymphoblastic leukemia ( 11997 ). more Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there is interest in using oral vitamin E for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin E for this condition. Cisplatin-associated ototoxicity. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for preventing ototoxicity due to cisplatin. A small clinical study in patients receiving cisplatin for solid tumors shows that taking a specific vitamin E supplement (Rigentex, Bracco) as alpha-tocopherol 400 IU daily for 3 months attenuates hearing loss when compared with placebo ( 97082 ). more Colistin-induced nephrotoxicity. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for preventing nephrotoxicity due to colistin. A small clinical study in patients receiving colistin therapy shows that taking vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 400 IU orally daily for the duration of colistin therapy does not reduce the incidence or duration of acute kidney injury when compared with colistin alone ( 107867 ). more Contrast induced nephropathy. It is unclear if oral or intravenous vitamin E is beneficial in patients with nephropathy due to contrast dye. A small clinical study in patients receiving elective computer-assisted tomography with nonionic radiocontrast agents shows that receiving vitamin E 3218 IU emulsion in 0.45% saline intravenously infused at the rate of 1 mL/kg/hr over 24 hours does not decrease the risk of contrast agent-induced nephropathy when compared with normal saline alone ( 90081 ). However, oral vitamin E may modestly reduce the risk of contrast induced nephropathy. A clinical trial shows that taking vitamin E as alpha-tocopherol 522 IU or gamma-tocopherol 447 IU orally daily, starting 5 days prior to the procedure and continuing 2 days post-procedure, results in a 9% to 10% lower incidence of contrast induced acute kidney injury when compared with standard treatment with normal saline ( 90096 ). Another clinical study shows that taking a single dose of vitamin E 1490 IU orally before elective coronary angiography reduces the risk of contrast induced kidney injury by 7% when compared with placebo ( 97074 ). more Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for recovery after CABG. When taking vitamin E orally with vitamin C and allopurinol two days prior to CABG and one day postoperatively, patients had fewer perioperative infarctions and lower creatine kinase-MB release ( 4699 ); however, this benefit was not found when using vitamin E alone or in combination with vitamin C without allopurinol ( 4697 , 4698 ). Other clinical research in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery in Iran shows that taking vitamin E 1200 IU and zinc 120 mg orally the day before surgery and vitamin E 200 IU and zinc 30 mg orally daily for 3 weeks after the surgery reduces hospital length of stay by approximately 2 days when compared with placebo ( 114118 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to vitamin E, zinc, or the combination. Additionally, the generalizability of this result is limited by the single-center study design and inclusion of only lower risk patients. more Critical illness (trauma). An analysis of several small clinical studies suggests that oral or intravenous vitamin E is not beneficial in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A meta-analysis of 5 small clinical studies in patients admitted to the ICU shows that administration of oral or intravenous vitamin E 400-3000 IU daily for up to 4 weeks does not decrease the length of hospital or ICU stay or reduce the risk of mortality when compared with control ( 112335 ). The validity of these findings is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity among the studies, which included differences in vitamin E dosing, duration of therapy, and reasons for ICU admission. more Dementia. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for dementia prevention; the available research is conflicting. A longitudinal cohort study in Japanese adults aged 40 years or older at baseline who were followed for a median of about 20 years, shows that total daily dietary intake of vitamin E is inversely associated with the risk of developing dementia, with a hazard ratio of about 0.8 for the highest compared with lowest quartiles of intake ( 107857 ). In a longitudinal cohort study of males aged 71-93 years, consuming supplemental vitamin E and vitamin C decreased the risk of developing vascular and mixed or other dementias; however, there was no protective effect for Alzheimer dementia ( 4636 ). Evidence from clinical research that evolved into an observational study shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU daily does not decrease the incidence of dementia in males 60 years or older ( 93570 ). However, the results from this study are limited by selection bias due to the high education levels and relatively young age of the participants, limitations with case ascertainment, and problems with follow-up ( 93570 , 93571 ). Also, these studies did not distinguish between different forms of vitamin E ( 4636 , 93570 ). more Depression. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with depression. A meta-analysis of 7 mostly small clinical studies in patients without major depressive disorder shows that taking vitamin E 400-2000 IU daily for up to 6 months modestly improves depression symptom scores when compared with placebo ( 112158 ). It is unclear if these findings can be generalized to patients with depression. more Developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for DCD; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), also known as dyspraxia, shows that taking vitamin E orally, in combination with evening primrose oil, thyme oil, and fish oils, for 4 months seems to improve movement when compared with control ( 5708 ). The effects of vitamin E alone on DCD are unclear. more Diabetes. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of diabetes. Population research has found that higher vitamin E dietary intake is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes ( 14004 ). However, individual clinical studies in patients with existing diabetes show mixed results ( 13496 , 13497 , 90095 , 90099 , 98259 ). A meta-analysis of 36 small clinical studies in patients with diabetes suggests that vitamin E may slightly improve some measures of glycemic control. In patients with type 2 diabetes, vitamin E seems to reduce glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by around 0.2% and improve insulin resistance, but not fasting blood glucose, when compared with placebo. In patients with type 1 diabetes, vitamin E seems to reduce HbA1c by around 0.8%, but does not improve fasting blood glucose, when compared with placebo ( 112161 ). The validity of this analysis is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity across the studies, including differences in vitamin E dose, treatment duration, concomitant medications, patient populations, and study designs. more Diabetic foot ulcers. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for diabetic foot ulcers; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in adults with a grade 3 diabetic foot ulcer shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU and magnesium oxide 250 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces ulcer length, width, and depth when compared with placebo ( 101436 ). A small clinical study in adults with non-healing diabetic foot ulcers being treated with a platelet-rich plasma fibrin glue dressing shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU and vitamin C 12.5 mg orally twice daily for 8 weeks increases the rate of ulcer healing when compared with placebo. In those receiving vitamins, 46% of wounds closed completely, compared with 17% of those receiving placebo ( 107870 ). It is not clear if the effects seen in these studies are due to vitamin E, the other nutrients, or the combinations. more Diabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function. A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking vitamin E 600-1200 mg daily, alone or with other antioxidants, modestly reduces urinary albumin excretion when compared with placebo or no treatment, but seems to have no effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ( 97069 ). A small clinical study in patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking a specific tocotrienol-rich vitamin E supplement (Tocovid SupraBio, Hovid Nutriworld) 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks seems to modestly reduce serum creatinine, with a corresponding increase in GFR, when compared with placebo. According to a sub-group analysis, these improvements remain statistically significant in patients with low tocopherol levels (less than 42 mcmol/L) at baseline, but not in those with higher levels at baseline ( 103010 ). Another small clinical study shows that taking this same supplement regimen for 12 months reduces serum creatinine levels and improves GFR at 8 months, but not 12 months, when compared with placebo. In a subgroup analysis of patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease, these benefits persisted at 12 months when compared with placebo ( 107390 ). more Diabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for improving diabetic neuropathy symptoms. A small clinical trial in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and neuropathy shows that taking a specific vitamin E supplement (Evion) 400 IU daily for 12 weeks modestly decreases neuropathic pain scores when compared to baseline ( 90091 ). Another very small clinical trial shows that taking vitamin E 1341 IU daily for 6 months improves nerve conduction in diabetic neuropathy when compared with placebo ( 4724 ). more Down syndrome. Oral vitamin E does not seem to slow cognitive decline in patients with this condition. A clinical study in patients over 50 years old with Down syndrome shows that taking vitamin E 1000 IU twice daily for 3 years does not slow cognitive decline when compared with placebo ( 97076 ). more Endometriosis. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical trial in patients with endometriosis and pelvic pain shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU and vitamin C 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks improves dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain scores when compared with placebo ( 106622 ). more Extravasation. Topical vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO); its effect when used alone is unclear. A very small clinical study in patients receiving chemotherapy shows that applying vitamin E topically, in combination with DMSO, seems to prevent skin ulceration after chemotherapy extravasation ( 4668 ). more Gastric cancer. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for preventing gastric cancer or reducing associated mortality. Population studies have found that increasing dietary vitamin E intake by 22.4 IU daily is associated with a 21% decreased risk of gastric cancer ( 3360 , 90083 ). However, clinical trials have not found that vitamin E supplements reduce gastric cancer risk ( 3960 , 4676 , 4677 , 12185 ). Studies evaluating vitamin E in combination with other supplements have been inconsistent. In one large-scale clinical trial a specific combination of vitamin E 100 IU with selenium 37.5 mcg and vitamin C 250 mg twice daily for about 7 years did not reduce risk of gastric cancer in patients from Shandong Province in China where there is a very high prevalence of gastric cancer ( 14447 , 90085 ). In another large-scale clinical study of 29,584 people in China, the combination of oral vitamin E, beta-carotene, and selenium over 5 years did reduce total mortality, total cancer mortality, and stomach cancer mortality ( 4679 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E plus beta-carotene with or without vitamin C does not reduce gastric cancer incidence ( 12185 ). more Glomerulosclerosis. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces proteinuria due to glomerulosclerosis in children. A very small clinical study in children with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis who are refractory to standard medical management shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU daily orally might reduce proteinuria when compared with baseline ( 4675 ). The validity of this finding is limited by a lack of control group. more Granuloma annulare. Although there is interest in using topical vitamin E for granuloma annulare, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin E for this condition. Helicobacter pylori. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A clinical study in patients with Helicobacter pylori dyspepsia without ulcers shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU and vitamin C 500 mg by mouth twice daily for 30 days in addition to standard triple therapy increases eradication rates by 37% when compared with triple therapy alone ( 90094 ). It is not clear if this benefit is due to vitamin E, vitamin C, or the combination. more Huntington disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin E improves Huntington disease symptoms. A small clinical study shows that taking RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) might improve symptoms in patients with early Huntington disease, but this benefit is not seen in patients with more advanced disease when compared with placebo ( 4686 ). more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for hypertension. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in adults with hypertension shows that taking vitamin E 200-400 IU orally daily for 2-27 weeks substantially lowers systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic blood pressure, when compared with control ( 113668 ). The validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity. Other preliminary clinical research in patients with hypertension who are receiving conventional treatment shows that taking vitamin E 300 mg daily orally for 3-4 years does not lower blood pressure when compared with control ( 5210 ). more IgA nephropathy. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for IgA nephropathy in children. A small clinical study in children with IgA nephropathy shows that taking vitamin E (400 IU for those weighing less than 30 kg; 800 IU for those weighing more than 30 kg) improves urinary protein to creatinine ratio, but not glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance, or hematuria, when compared with placebo ( 85063 ). more Infertility. It is unclear if oral vitamin E improves pregnancy rates in females with infertility of unknown cause. A small clinical study in females experiencing implantation failure shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU daily for 12 weeks improves endometrial thickness when compared with placebo ( 99852 ). However, an observational study suggests that there is no association between dietary vitamin E intake and in-vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes including good oocyte quality, embryo transfer success rates, clinical pregnancy rates, and successful term pregnancy rates in subfertile couples who are candidates for IVF ( 112097 ). Vitamin E has also been studied in combination with selenium. In a small clinical study in patients with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), taking vitamin E 400 IU with selenium 200 mcg orally daily for 90 days increases anti-Mullerian hormone index, antral follicle count, and mean ovarian volume after 12 months of follow-up when compared with placebo ( 107866 ). It is unclear if these improvements correlate to higher pregnancy or live birth rates. more Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although there is interest in using oral vitamin E for IBD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin E for this condition. Insomnia. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with insomnia. A moderate-sized clinical study in postmenopausal patients with chronic insomnia shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU daily for 1 month improves sleep quality ratings and reduces the need for sedative medications when compared with placebo ( 112163 ). more Intermittent claudication. It is unclear if oral vitamin E improves intermittent claudication symptoms. A large clinical study in male smokers with intermittent claudication shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 50 mg orally daily for about 3.7 years does not appear to have any effect when used alone or in combination with beta-carotene for treating symptoms or disease progression when compared with placebo ( 4732 ). However, according to poor-quality clinical research included in a meta-analysis, taking vitamin E 447-2384 IU daily for up to 18 months appears to reduce symptoms of intermittent claudication ( 85023 ). more Lice. Topical synthetic vitamin E might be beneficial for head lice eradication. A small clinical study in children and adults with head lice shows that topical application of a specific tocopheryl acetate 20% spray (LiceKO, Panin SRL) once, and then again 7 days later, is more effective for eliminating lice when compared with permethrin 1% cream rinse ( 90067 ). more Male infertility. An analysis of several small, low-quality clinical studies suggests that oral vitamin E might improve pregnancy rates and measures of sperm health in males with infertility. Several small clinical studies in males with infertility show conflicting results ( 3583 , 4695 , 107865 ). However, a meta-analysis of 7 small, low-quality clinical trials shows that taking vitamin E 300-600 IU for 12-48 weeks increases pregnancy rates by 86% and modestly improves sperm count, concentration, motility, and vitality, but does not seem to increase semen volume, when compared with a control ( 109461 ). Vitamin E has also been used in combination with other nutrients with unclear results. Small studies show that taking vitamin E 800 mg daily with vitamin C 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks doesn't seem to improve sperm functionality ( 4696 ), while vitamin E 400 IU plus selenium 200 mcg daily for at least 100 days improves sperm functionality, but not fertilization rates, when compared with baseline ( 3585 ). In another small clinical study in infertile males undergoing varicocelectomy, taking vitamin E 400 IU, selenium 200 mcg, and folic acid 5 mg daily for 6 months improved sperm count and motility when compared with control ( 102968 ). Another small clinical study shows that taking vitamin E 100 mg and coenzyme Q10 10 mg three times daily for 3 months modestly increases levels of testosterone and improves progressive sperm motility and morphology when compared to baseline. However, taking an L-carnitine nutrient complex 15 grams twice daily was more effective for increasing testosterone and improving sperm parameters ( 109390 ). However, it is unclear if any of these combination therapies increases live birth rates. more Melanoma. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for reducing melanoma risk. A sub-group analysis of a large-scale clinical trial in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease suggests that taking RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 400 IU daily for about 7 years is not linked with a reduced risk of developing melanoma when compared with placebo ( 13036 ). more Menopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for reducing menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. A small clinical study in postmenopausal patients shows that taking vitamin E 200 IU twice daily for 8 weeks reduces hot flashes, but does not affect other menopausal symptoms or anxiety, when compared with placebo. The improvement in hot flashes was no longer present 4 weeks after the intervention ( 102969 ). However, a meta-analysis of 3 small clinical studies in postmenopausal patients, including the study above, shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU daily for 8 weeks does not reduce hot flash frequency when compared with placebo ( 111460 ). more Methotrexate toxicity. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces the risk of liver toxicity due to methotrexate. An observational study in patients taking methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis has found that taking vitamin E 400 mg twice daily for 3 months is associated with reductions in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) levels when compared with no supplementation. This suggests a reduction in liver injury in the treatment group ( 104414 ). more Muscular dystrophy. Small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin E may not improve muscular dystrophy symptoms or progression. Small clinical studies in patients with myotonic or Duchenne muscular dystrophy show that taking vitamin E along with penicillamine or selenium doesn't appear to slow disease progression or improve symptoms when compared with placebo ( 4703 , 4704 ). more Nocturnal leg cramps. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces leg cramps in veterans or in patients on hemodialysis. A small clinical study in adults undergoing hemodialysis shows that taking vitamin E 400 IU at bedtime for 2 months seems to reduce the frequency of nocturnal leg cramps when compared with placebo ( 4701 ). However, another small clinical study in male veterans shows that taking vitamin E 800 IU at bedtime for 4 weeks does not reduce cramp frequency or severity or reduce sleep disturbances when compared with placebo ( 4702 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in adults or children with NAFLD. One meta-analysis of studies assessing both NAFLD patients and patients in whom NAFLD progressed to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) shows that taking vitamin E 100-800 IU daily for 1-24 months improves liver enzyme levels, hepatic steatosis, and lobular inflammation when compared with control. However, taking vitamin E does not appear to improve hepatic fibrosis in these patients ( 97077 ). Methodological limitations such as publication bias and unclear calculations limit the reliability of these results. Another meta-analysis of 8 small clinical trials in adults with NAFLD shows that taking vitamin E 400-800 IU daily for up to 24 weeks improves liver enzyme levels when compared with placebo ( 112336 ). Vitamin E has also been evaluated in children with NAFLD. A meta-analysis of studies in this population shows that taking vitamin E 15-900 IU daily for up to 24 months reduces total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, but does not affect liver enzyme levels, measures of insulin resistance, body mass index (BMI), ballooning degeneration of the liver, or liver fibrosis when compared with placebo ( 107861 ). Until additional data showing its benefit becomes available, practice guidelines by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) state that vitamin E is not recommended in patients with NAFLD without liver biopsy ( 98130 ). more Obesity. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for improving weight loss. A meta-analysis of 24 small clinical studies shows that taking oral vitamin E, 67-900 mg daily does not affect weight, body mass index (BMI), or waist circumference in adults with obesity. In fact, in people with a normal BMI, vitamin E seems to increase body weight ( 107859 ). more Oral mucositis. It is unclear if oral or topical vitamin E is beneficial in patients with oral mucositis from chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Vitamin E has been evaluated in both chemotherapy- and radiation-induced mucositis. A small clinical study in children with chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis shows that a specific vitamin E product (Evion Paediatric Drops, Merck Limited) 200 IU applied topically in three divided doses daily for 1 week improves healing, pain, and the ability to eat when compared with placebo ( 94585 ). However, another small clinical study in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer shows that taking vitamin E 1000 mg once daily with pentoxifylline 400 mg twice daily does not reduce the incidence or severity of oral mucositis and dysphagia when compared with control ( 102972 ). more Osteopenia. It is unclear if oral vitamin E helps slow the progression of osteopenia. A small clinical study in postmenopausal adults with osteopenia who are taking calcium and vitamin D supplements shows that taking vitamin E (mixed tocopherols) 400 IU daily for 12 weeks prevents the increase in serum C-terminal telopeptide, a marker of bone resorption, seen with placebo over that same time period ( 107868 ). more Osteoporosis. It is unclear if oral vitamin E helps to reduce complications of osteoporosis such as fractures. Observational research has found that vitamin E supplementation is associated with a 22% lower risk of hip fracture and a 14% lower risk of all fractures in elderly females with osteoporosis ( 90086 ). Additional observational research has found that higher dietary vitamin E intake is also associated with a 34% reduced risk of fractures in adults at risk for osteoporosis ( 104415 ). more Periodontitis. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in patients with moderate or advanced periodontitis shows that taking a supplement containing vitamin E, alpha-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, and other ingredients orally twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard nonsurgical therapy does not improve periodontal indices including bleeding on probing, gingival recession, plaque index, or inflammation, among others, when compared with placebo ( 111708 ). more Peyronie disease. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces Peyronie disease symptoms. A small clinical study in patients with Peyronie disease shows that taking vitamin E 894 IU daily in addition to conservative treatment for 6 months does not improve pain, but may reduce plaque, when compared with using conservative treatment alone. Conservative treatment included verapamil 10 mg biweekly injection and iontophoresis, blueberries 160 mg orally daily, propolis 600 mg orally daily, and topical diclofenac 4% twice daily ( 90090 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to vitamin E, the other interventions, or the combination. more Photoreactive keratectomy. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated for recovery after photoreactive keratectomy in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients undergoing laser surgery for myopia shows that taking vitamin A (retinol palmitate) 50,000-75,000 units with vitamin E (alpha-tocopheryl nicotinate) 343 IU daily seems to accelerate re-epithelialization, reduce haze formation, and improve visual acuity when compared with placebo ( 348 ). more Physical performance. It is unclear if oral vitamin E improves physical performance in the elderly. Population research has found that increasing intake of dietary vitamin E is associated with increased physical performance and muscle strength in elderly people ( 14006 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Analyses of small clinical studies suggest that oral vitamin E may modestly reduce lipid levels in patients with PCOS. It is unclear if vitamin E can improve glycemic control, body weight, hormone levels, or symptoms of PCOS. Meta-analyses of several small clinical studies in patients with PCOS show that taking vitamin E, alone or in combination with coenzyme Q10, fish oil, magnesium, or vitamin D, reduces total cholesterol by 9-18 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 7-16 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 13-21 mg/dL when compared with placebo. However, vitamin E does not appear to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, reduce body weight, or improve hirsutism. The effects of vitamin E on glycemic indices and levels of testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin are unclear; individual meta-analyses show mixed results ( 112167 , 112168 , 112169 ). The validity of these findings is limited by a high degree of heterogeneity across the included studies, which varied in vitamin E dosing, treatment duration, and concomitant supplements used. more Premature rupture of membranes (PROM). Oral vitamin E does not seem to prevent PROM, although it's unclear if it might prevent premature delivery due to PROM. Vitamin E has been evaluated for the prevention and management of PROM. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking vitamin E with other ingredients throughout pregnancy does not affect the risk of developing PROM when compared with placebo ( 97075 ). However, a clinical study in patients with PROM shows that taking vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol acetate) 400 IU and vitamin C 1000 mg daily, starting within 1 hour of membrane rupture and continuing for an unspecified amount of time, seems to hold back premature delivery by about 5 days when compared with placebo. However, maternal or neonatal outcomes did not seem to be affected ( 90078 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to vitamin E, vitamin C, or the combination. more Radiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical vitamin E is effective for the prevention or treatment of radiation dermatitis. A small clinical study in patients undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer shows that applying a cream containing nanoparticles of vitamin E 2%, three times daily and after each radiation session until 2 weeks after radiation therapy is complete, does not reduce the severity of radiation dermatitis or improve quality of life when compared with a placebo cream. However, in patients that did not receive a boosted radiation dose, this vitamin E cream seems to slightly delay the onset of dermatitis when compared with placebo ( 112333 ). more Radiation fibrosis. It is unclear if topical vitamin E reduces radiation fibrosis symptoms. Clinical research shows that taking vitamin E 1000 IU orally with pentoxifylline 800 mg daily seems to reverse radiation fibrosis ( 4672 , 4673 ). Regression of radiation fibrosis becomes significant after three months of treatment and continues to improve thereafter. After 12 months of treatment, mean surface area of fibrosis can decrease by 66% ( 4672 ). It is unclear if the benefit is due to vitamin E, pentoxifylline, or the combination. One very small study suggests that vitamin E alone does not seem to be effective when compared with placebo ( 10363 ). more Radiation-induced sialadenitis. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is effective for the prevention or treatment of radiation-induced sialadenitis. A small clinical study in patients undergoing radiation therapy for thyroid cancer shows that taking vitamin E 200 mg daily for 5 weeks, starting 1 week before radiotherapy, improves several measures of parotid and submandibular salivary gland function when compared to baseline, suggesting that vitamin E might prevent radiation-induced sialadenitis and its associated complications ( 112332 ). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of control group. more Renal cell carcinoma. It is unclear if oral vitamin E reduces renal cell carcinoma risk. In 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim regarding vitamin E and renal cell carcinoma risk. This qualified health claim was based on one weak and limited study. The FDA has determined that it is highly uncertain that vitamin E supplements reduce the risk of renal cell carcinoma ( 102332 ). more Restless legs syndrome (RLS). Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in hemodialysis patients shows that taking vitamin E 596 IU, vitamin C 200 mg, or a combination of both daily for 8 weeks modestly reduces severity of restless legs syndrome when compared with placebo ( 90093 ). more Retinopathy of prematurity. It is unclear whether oral or parenteral vitamin E reduces the risk for retinopathy in prematurity (ROP). A clinical study in very low birth weight infants with respiratory distress syndrome suggests that giving vitamin E 12.5 IU twice daily from 72 hours after birth through 28 days of age might reduce the incidence of stage 1 ROP when compared with placebo. However, the difference reached significance in the per-protocol analysis, but not in the intention-to-treat analysis ( 107864 ). Also, a meta-analysis that did not include this more recent study shows that administering oral, intravenous, or intramuscular vitamin E daily does not reduce the risk for ROP. Additionally, high levels of vitamin E and large intravenous doses of vitamin E have been associated with an increased risk for sepsis in premature infants ( 85062 ). more Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial in patients with RA. A small clinical study in adults with RA shows that taking vitamin E 600 mg twice daily in conjunction with standard therapy for 12 weeks is superior to standard therapy alone for reducing pain, but not inflammation ( 4723 ). However, other studies show mixed results. A meta-analysis of 7 small clinical studies in patients with RA shows that taking vitamin E up to 1200 IU daily for up to 12 weeks does not reduce pain, tenderness, swelling, or morning stiffness when compared with control ( 112330 ). more Schizophrenia. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Taking vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol) 135.8 IU and a specific ascorbic acid supplement (CellaVie) 250 mg with or without ethyl eicosapentaenoate 500 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve negative or positive symptoms of schizophrenia when compared with placebo ( 89234 ). more Sickle cell disease. Although there is interest in using oral vitamin E for sickle cell disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of vitamin E for this condition. Stretch marks (striae distensae). Topical vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research shows that using a moisturizer containing vitamin E, rosehip oil, hydroxyprolisilane C, and gotu kola triterpenes at least twice daily on affected areas does not decrease incidence of new stretch marks, but does decrease the severity of new stretch marks by about 30%, when compared with control cream in pregnant patients ( 90076 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to vitamin E, other ingredients, or the combination. more Stroke. It is unclear if oral vitamin E is beneficial for reducing stroke risk. A trial-sequential meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials with 148,000 patients shows that vitamin E does not seem to reduce the risk of total stroke when compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis, vitamin E was associated with an 8% lower risk of ischemic stroke and a trend to an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke when compared with placebo. Based on subgroup analyses, there was no difference on risk based on vitamin E dosage, use of synthetic versus natural vitamin E, and whether prevention was primary or secondary ( 104408 ). This analysis was limited due to high heterogeneity, small study size, and insufficient power to detect differences between treatments. Older meta-analyses also found mixed results of using vitamin E 74.5-1192 IU daily alone or in combination for up to 10 years. However, there was a similar sub-group analysis finding that vitamin E might reduce the risk of ischemic stroke, but it might also increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke ( 14621 , 85201 ). Some clinical research shows that taking all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) might reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in male smokers with hypertension and diabetes ( 3359 ). more Sunburn. Topical vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Oral vitamin E alone does not seem to prevent sunburn. Two small, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies suggest that taking high dose oral RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) up to 2 grams daily in combination with vitamin C 3 grams protects against skin inflammation after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, taking vitamin E alone does not seem to be beneficial when compared with control ( 4715 , 4716 ). This combination was also tried topically. In one study, topically applied vitamin E in combination with topical vitamin C and melatonin provided modest photoprotective effect when used prior to UV exposure, but had no effect when used during or after UV exposure ( 4713 , 4714 ). more Uveitis. Oral vitamin E has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research shows that taking vitamin E 149 IU twice daily with vitamin C 500 mg daily for 8 weeks improves visual acuity in patients with acute anterior uveitis, but does not seem to decrease inflammation measured by laser flare, when compared with placebo ( 4730 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to vitamin E, vitamin C, or the combination. more Vaginal atrophy. It is unclear if a vitamin E suppository is beneficial in patients with vaginal atrophy. A small clinical study in females with breast cancer and tamoxifen-induced vaginal atrophy shows that intravaginal administration of a vitamin E 1 mg suppository nightly before bed for 8 weeks improves self-reported symptoms of vaginal atrophy, decreases vaginal pH, and improves vaginal estrogenization, as measured by the Vaginal Maturation Index, when compared with placebo ( 99773 ). more More evidence is needed to rate vitamin E for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Likely Safe when used orally or topically and appropriately. Vitamin E is generally considered safe, even at doses exceeding the recommended dietary allowance (RDA); however, adverse effects are more likely to occur with higher doses. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) in healthy people is 1000 mg daily, equivalent to 1100 IU of synthetic vitamin E (all-rac-alpha-tocopherol) or 1500 IU of natural vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol) ( 4668 , 4681 , 4713 , 4714 , 4844 , 89234 , 90067 , 90069 , 90072 , 19206 )( 63244 , 97075 ). Although there is some concern that taking vitamin E in doses of 400 IU (form unspecified) per day or higher might increase the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality from all causes ( 12212 , 13036 , 15305 , 16709 , 83339 ), most of this evidence comes from studies that included middle-aged or older patients with chronic diseases or patients from developing countries in which nutritional deficiencies are prevalent. Possibly Unsafe when used orally in high doses. Repeated doses exceeding the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 1000 mg daily are associated with significant side effects in otherwise healthy people ( 4844 ). ...when used intravenously in large doses. Large repeated intravenous doses of all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) were associated with decreased activity of clotting factors and bleeding in one report ( 3074 ). ...when inhaled. E-cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated lung injury (EVALI) has occurred among adults who use e-cigarette, or vaping, products, which often contain vitamin E acetate. In some cases, this has resulted in death. The majority of patients with EVALI reported using tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products in the 3 months prior to the development of symptoms. Vitamin E acetate has been detected in most bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken from patients with EVALI. Other ingredients, including THC or nicotine, were also commonly found in samples. However, priority toxicants including medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, plant oil, petroleum distillate, or terpenes, were undetectable in almost all samples. While this association shows a correlation between vitamin E acetate inhalation and lung injury, a causal link has not yet been determined, and it is not clear if other toxic compounds are also involved ( 101061 , 101062 , 102970 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Vitamin E has been safely used in children in amounts below the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL for healthy children is: 200 mg in children aged 1-3 years, 300 mg in children aged 4-8 years, 600 mg in children aged 9-13 years, and 800 mg in children aged 14-18 years. A UL has not been established for infants up to 12 months of age ( 23388 ). CHILDREN: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in doses above the UL due to increased risk of adverse effects ( 23388 ). ...when alpha-tocopherol is used intravenously in large doses in premature infants. Large intravenous doses of vitamin E are associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis and sepsis in this population ( 85062 , 85083 ). ...when inhaled. E-cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated lung injury (EVALI) has occurred among adolescents and teenagers who use e-cigarette, or vaping, products. In some cases, this has resulted in death. The majority of patients with EVALI reported using tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products in the 3 months prior to the development of symptoms. Constituents in E-cigarette or vaping products with the potential to cause lung injury or impaired lung function include lipids, such as vitamin E acetate. Vitamin E acetate has been detected in all bronchoalveolar lavage samples taken from patients with EVALI. No other ingredient, including THC or nicotine, was found in all samples, and other ingredients, including medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, plant oil, petroleum distillate, or terpenes, were undetectable This shows that vitamin E acetate is at the primary site of lung injury. A causal link has not yet been described and it is not clear if other compounds are also involved ( 101061 , 101062 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) during pregnancy is 800 mg for those 14-18 years of age and 1000 mg for those 19 years and older. However, maternal supplementation is not generally recommended unless dietary vitamin E falls below the RDA ( 4260 ). No serious adverse effects were reported with oral intake of 400 IU per day starting at weeks 9-22 of pregnancy in healthy patients or those at high risk for pre-eclampsia ( 3236 , 97075 ), or with 600-900 IU daily during the last two months of pregnancy ( 4260 ). However, some preliminary evidence suggests that taking vitamin E supplements might be harmful when taken in early pregnancy. A case-control study found that taking a vitamin E supplement during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy is associated with a 1.7-9-fold increase in odds of congenital heart defects ( 16823 ). However, the exact amount of vitamin E consumed during pregnancy in this study is unclear. Until more is known, advise patients to avoid taking a vitamin E supplement in early pregnancy unless needed for an appropriate medical indication. LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts that do not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL during lactation is 800 mg for those 14-18 years of age and 1000 mg for those 19 years and older ( 4844 ). LACTATION: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in amounts that exceed the UL due to increased risk of adverse effects ( 4844 ).",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: General : The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin E (as alpha-tocopherol) is 15 mg daily. For RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E), the RDA is 22 IU; for all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E), it is 33 IU ( 4844 ). The RDA during pregnancy is 15 mg; the RDA during lactation is 19 mg ( 4844 ). See the Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Taking vitamin E with food seems to improve absorption. Some research suggests that taking vitamin E with high-fat food may further improve absorption because the fat allows for solubilization and incorporation into micelles ( 4844 , 85095 , 97072 ). However, other research suggests that low-fat food can also improve vitamin E absorption ( 6133 , 6405 ). Dosing for vitamin E can be confusing. Quantities may be listed in various sources and clinical studies as mg or International Units (IU). Current guidelines have expressed RDAs and tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamin E in mg. However, some products are still labeled in IUs. Thus, it is important to understand how to convert between IUs and mg of vitamin E. The appropriate method for doing this depends on the formulation of vitamin E being considered and whether an RDA or a UL is being calculated. For an RDA calculation, RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) can be converted from IU to mg of alpha-tocopherol by multiplying by a factor of 0.67. For example, 30 IU of RRR-alpha-tocopherol equals 20 mg. To convert all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) from IU to mg of alpha-tocopherol, multiply by a factor of 0.45. For example, 30 IU all-rac-alpha-tocopherol equals 13.5 mg. When calculating a UL, the conversion factor for RRR-alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) remains the same. However, the conversion factor for all-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) is different because the UL assumes that all isomers of vitamin E can contribute to toxicity. To convert all-rac-alpha tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) from IU to mg, multiply by a factor of 0.91. For example, 2000 IUs all-rac-alpha tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) is equivalent to 1820 mg. The same factors are used for either acetate or succinate salts because the content has been adjusted for the molecular weights of the salts ( 4844 ). Topical: Vitamin E has been used in various formulations, including a spray, cream, intravaginal suppository, and more. See the Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Children Oral: General : The RDAs for vitamin E (as alpha-tocopherol) in children are: 0-6 months of age, 4 mg; 7-12 months of age, 5 mg; 1-3 years of age, 6 mg; 4-8 years of age, 7 mg; 9-13 years of age, 11 mg; 14 years and older, 15 mg ( 4844 ). See the Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization & Formulation All-rac-alpha-tocopherol is the synthetic version of vitamin E. RRR-alpha-tocopherol is vitamin E extracted from natural sources ( 12212 ). Vitamin E exists in eight different forms (isomers): alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol; and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol ( 13504 ).",
  "interactions_text": "Expand All | Collapse All ALKYLATING AGENTS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, antioxidant effects of vitamin E might reduce the effectiveness of alkylating agents. There's concern that antioxidants could reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs which generate free radicals, such as cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, carmustine, busulfan, and thiotepa ( 391 ). However, some researchers theorize that antioxidants might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that might interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells ( 14012 , 14013 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, antioxidants such as vitamin E have on chemotherapy. Advise patients to consult their oncologist before using vitamin E supplements, especially in high doses. more ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Concomitant use of vitamin E and anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents might increase the risk of bleeding. Vitamin E seems to inhibit of platelet aggregation and antagonize the effects of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors ( 4733 , 4844 , 11580 , 11582 , 11583 , 11584 , 11586 , 112162 ). These effects appear to be dose-dependent, and are probably only likely to be clinically significant with doses of at least 800 units daily ( 11582 , 11585 ). Mixed tocopherols, such as those found in food, might have a greater antiplatelet effect than alpha-tocopherol ( 10364 ). RRR alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) 1000 IU daily antagonizes vitamin K-dependent clotting factors ( 11999 ). Advise patients to avoid high doses of vitamin E, especially in people with low vitamin K intake or other risk factors for bleeding. more ANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, antioxidant effects of vitamin E might reduce the effectiveness of antitumor antibiotics. There's concern that antioxidants could reduce the activity of antitumor antibiotic drugs such as doxorubicin, which generate free radicals ( 391 ). However, some researchers theorize that antioxidants might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that might interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells ( 14012 , 14013 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, antioxidants such as vitamin E have on chemotherapy involving antitumor antibiotics. Advise patients to consult their oncologist before using vitamin E supplements, especially in high doses. more CYCLOSPORINE (Neoral, Sandimmune) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) A specific form of vitamin E might increase absorption and levels of cyclosporine. There is some evidence that one specific formulation of vitamin E (D-alpha-tocopheryl-polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate, TPGS, tocophersolan, Liqui-E) might increase absorption of cyclosporine. This vitamin E formulation forms micelles which seems to increase absorption of cyclosporine by 40% to 72% in some patients ( 624 , 625 , 10368 ). However, this interaction is unlikely to occur with the usual forms of vitamin E. more CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, vitamin E might induce metabolism of CYP3A4, possibly reducing the levels CYP3A4 substrates. Vitamin E appears to bind with the nuclear receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), which results in increased expression of CYP3A4 ( 13499 , 13500 ). Although the clinical significance of this is not known, use caution when considering concomitant use of vitamin E and other drugs affected by these enzymes. more NIACIN Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence A (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT)) Vitamin E might decrease the beneficial effects of niacin on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. A combination of niacin and simvastatin (Zocor) effectively raises high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in people with coronary disease and low HDL levels. Clinical research shows that taking a combination of antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and selenium) along with niacin and simvastatin (Zocor) attenuates this rise in HDL, specifically the HDL-2 and apolipoprotein A1 fractions, by more than 50% ( 7388 , 11537 ). Vitamin E alone combined with a statin does not seem to decrease HDL levels ( 11286 , 11287 ). It is not known whether the adverse effect on HDL is due to one of the other antioxidants or to the combination. It also is not known whether it will occur in other patient populations. more SELUMETINIB (Koselugo) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Taking selumetinib with vitamin E can result in a total daily dose of vitamin E that exceeds safe limits and therefore might increase the risk of bleeding. Selumetinib contains 48-54 IU vitamin E per capsule ( 102971 ). The increased risk of bleeding with vitamin E appears to be dose-dependent ( 11582 , 11585 , 34577 ). Be cautious when using selumetinib in combination with supplemental vitamin E, especially in patients at higher risk of bleed, such as those with chronic conditions and those taking antiplatelet drugs ( 102971 ). more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Using vitamin E with warfarin might increase the risk of bleeding. Due to interference with production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, use of more than 400 IU of vitamin E daily with warfarin might increase prothrombin time (PT), INR, and the risk of bleeding, ( 91 , 92 , 93 ). At a dose of 1000 IU per day, vitamin E can antagonize vitamin K-dependent clotting factors even in people not taking warfarin ( 11999 ). Limited clinical evidence suggests that doses up to 1200 IU daily may be used safely by patients taking warfarin, but this may not be applicable in all patient populations ( 90 ). more",
  "mechanism_text": "General Vitamin E is naturally occurring in many foods including vegetable oils, cereal grains, animal fats, meat, poultry, eggs, fruits, and vegetables ( 96 ). Vitamin E refers to eight different forms including alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherols and four tocotrienols. Most vitamin E in foods is gamma-tocopherol while most supplements contain alpha-tocopherol, which has the highest bioavailability and is used to set dietary requirements ( 107858 ). Unlike most nutrients, vitamin E does not appear to have a specific role in a required metabolic process. The major function of vitamin E is probably that of a chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents the formation of free radicals. Vitamin E's therapeutic benefits have primarily been attributed to its antioxidant effects ( 4844 , 12494 , 13501 , 30898 ). Alpha-tocopherol is the most active form in humans. Although biological activity of other forms is significantly less and current guidelines do not include forms of vitamin E other than alpha-tocopherol for meeting dietary requirements ( 4844 ), the other forms, such as gamma-tocopherol and the tocotrienols, have been associated with some pharmacological activity. For example, gamma-tocopherol appears to decrease the programmed death of human coronary artery endothelial cells. There is some concern that high doses of vitamin E might have a pro-oxidant rather than an antioxidant effect ( 12495 , 13036 , 16823 ). Alpha-tocopherol-mediated peroxidation (TMP) occurs in vitro, but whether this occurs in vivo isn't clear ( 13504 ). High doses of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) alone might disrupt the normal antioxidant balance and decrease the effect of other vitamin E isomers such as gamma-tocopherol and other antioxidants ( 12496 , 13036 ). In early pregnancy, this imbalance may adversely affect uteroplacental tissues, affect development of placenta-related disease, and embryogenesis ( 16823 ). Analgesic effects Vitamin E is thought to reduce pain by decreasing the production of prostaglandins via prevention of phospholipid peroxidation and arachidonic acid release ( 99367 ). Anti-dementia effects Vitamin E has been studied for its ability to slow the progression of Alzheimer disease, possibly due to an interaction with free radicals and a disruption of cellular damage ( 11472 ). Preliminary data suggest vitamin E might improve cognitive function by decreasing beta-amyloid damage ( 4637 , 4638 , 4639 ). Anti-diabetic effects Vitamin E might be beneficial in diabetes. Population research shows that higher vitamin E intake is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes ( 14004 ). Some clinical research shows that taking vitamin E improves glucose disposal in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 4726 ). However, vitamin E supplementation does not seem to affect insulin resistance measured by the homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, and only improves glycemic parameters in patients with diabetes that also have low vitamin E levels at baseline ( 13496 , 90095 , 90099 , 98259 ). Anti-inflammatory effects A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with various conditions shows that taking vitamin E seems to modestly lower inflammatory markers, such as serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, when compared with control ( 104406 ). A meta-analysis of 11 trials in patients on hemodialysis shows that taking vitamin E, typically in a dose of 400 IU daily for 2-20 weeks, decreases markers of endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation, including intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and markers of systemic inflammation including CRP, when compared with placebo or no treatment. There was no effect on IL-6 ( 107863 ). Antineoplastic effects Increased vitamin E intake has been associated with a reduced risk of various cancers such as renal cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, and many others ( 3360 , 90083 , 98262 ). Theoretically, vitamin E reduces oxidative damage, which is associated with the development of cancers ( 5882 ). Several mechanisms have been theorized for reducing carcinogenesis, including the neutralization of reactive oxygen species, the inhibition of the formation of nitrosamines, and enhancement of immune function ( 9839 , 98262 ). Preliminary evidence also shows that vitamin E and other antioxidants can decrease oxidative damage associated with tumor-directed radio-immunotherapy ( 5882 ). Vitamin E is used for photo-aged skin and to prevent oxidative skin damage related to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (e.g., sunburn) due to its antioxidant effects. However, some researchers think that this benefit requires concomitant use with other antioxidants such as vitamin C to prevent degradation of vitamin E ( 6062 , 6064 ). Chemotherapy and radiation therapy also adversely affect vitamin E status ( 98 ). Vitamin E inhibits protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in several cell types, including smooth muscle, platelets, and monocytes ( 4844 ). Preliminary research suggests that vitamin E might have an antiproliferative effect on benign hyperplastic prostate cells ( 11235 ). Population studies suggest an association between low serum levels of alpha-tocopherol and higher risk of prostate cancer ( 12874 ). In vitro research suggests that gamma-tocopherol, the primary vitamin E form in food, inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells, but alpha-tocopherol has no effect ( 4089 , 13503 ). This inhibitory effect of vitamin E on prostate cancer cells might be due to its antiandrogen activity ( 12875 , 12876 ). RRR-alpha-tocopheryl succinate, known as vitamin E succinate (VES), is currently being researched for its chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive potential. VES has been shown to inhibit tumor cell growth, primarily by triggering apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma ( 3361 ). There is some evidence that the inhibitory effect on cancer cell growth by statin drugs with a closed ring structure, such as mevastatin and lovastatin (Mevacor), may be enhanced when used with alpha tocopheryl succinate ( 8046 ). Apolipoprotein effects A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that oral alpha-tocopherol in doses of 100-1200 IU daily does not have a significant effect on apolipoproteins A1 or B100 ( 107860 ). Cardiovascular effects Oxidative damage has been attributed to many conditions for which vitamin E is used, including lipid peroxidation in heart disease ( 6204 ). Some preliminary research suggests that vitamin E might inhibit the local inflammatory process and oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is associated with atherosclerosis ( 97 , 249 ), but when this theory was tested in healthy adults without heart disease, RRR-alpha-tocopherol, even at 2000 IU/day, did not produce markers that indicate a reduction in lipid oxidation ( 13159 ). It also does not appear to reduce levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation that is associated with cardiovascular disease, when used in combination with vitamin C and alpha-lipoic acid ( 14010 , 85129 ). This appears to be another case where promising laboratory data turns out to be clinically irrelevant. Vitamin E also doesn't appear to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation in older adults with hypercholesterolemia ( 11286 ). The tocotrienols from rice and barley bran might lower total cholesterol and LDL, possibly by decreasing activity of HMG CoA reductase, but in a different way than \"statin\" drugs ( 3237 , 3238 , 3239 , 3240 , 3241 ). Tocotrienols might also be capable of decreasing carotid artery plaque size in some people, possibly by decreasing platelet aggregation ( 3239 ). Vitamin E might also lower the protective high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. This potential pro-oxidant effect could result in adverse cardiovascular outcomes ( 13036 ). Gamma-tocopherol appears to prolong prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times and has caused hemorrhage in experimental animals ( 4098 ). Beta- and delta-tocopherol have also been shown to prolong prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times in laboratory animals ( 4098 ). Large amounts of vitamin E interfere with vitamin K-dependent clotting factor production, producing hypoprothrombinemic effects, especially in people with vitamin K deficiency or those who are taking oral anticoagulants ( 3073 , 3074 ). Mixed tocopherols seem to have a greater effect on platelet aggregation than alpha-tocopherol alone, which might explain the discrepancy between the effects of dietary vitamin E intake and supplemental vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) in cardiovascular disease. Mixed tocopherols seem to increase nitric oxide (NO) release and superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein content in platelets, which may contribute to the effect on platelet aggregation ( 10364 ). Central nervous system (CNS) effects In tardive dyskinesia, it is thought that some patients may have increased dopamine turnover resulting in increased production of free radicals and structural damage. The antioxidant effects of vitamin E may reduce the number of free radicals that increase dopamine turnover. Additionally, people with tardive dyskinesia may have decreased levels of vitamin E and vitamin C ( 3598 ). Also, in the treatment of epilepsy, vitamin E is primarily used because some patients taking anti-epileptic drugs have decreased blood levels of vitamin E. Vitamin E might also act as a membrane stabilizer and enzyme repressor in these patients ( 3356 , 6066 ). Deficiency Vitamin E deficiency is rare and most typically seen in genetic abnormalities that prevent maintenance of normal blood concentrations of vitamin E or conditions that prevent absorption. Vitamin E deficiency does not cause specific disease in adults, although creatinuria, ceroid deposition, muscle weakness, and decreased erythrocyte survival are associated with low serum vitamin E concentrations. In adults, total body stores of vitamin E, found in adipose tissue, have been estimated to be 3-8 grams and are sufficient to meet the body's requirements for 4 or more years of a deficient diet. In premature infants, vitamin E deficiency can cause irritability, edema, thrombosis, and hemolytic anemia ( 15 ). Some evidence links asthma to increased oxidative stress and vitamin E deficiency. Epidemiological and case-control studies have associated asthma with lower vitamin E intake, lower vitamin E serum levels, lower vitamin E levels in lung lining fluid, and maternal vitamin E intake during pregnancy ( 315 , 401 , 409 , 422 , 6058 , 15006 ). But clinical studies using vitamin E for asthma have not been performed. Vitamin E might also work by non-antioxidant mechanisms. Preliminary research suggests that it affects cellular signaling and modifies gene expression in cerebellar cells involved in the regulation of coordinated movement. Cerebellar ataxia is a symptom of vitamin E deficiency ( 13505 ). Immunomodulating effects Vitamin E may play a role in allergic reactions. Lower vitamin E serum levels have also been associated with higher IgE levels and positive allergen skin tests ( 5275 ). For immune function in the elderly, vitamin E supplementation might replenish an inapparent deficiency. Deficiency of vitamin E and other micronutrients are common in apparently well-nourished people over age 90 and might affect the number and function of natural killer cells in old age ( 4688 ). Most research suggests that vitamin E supplementation in healthy elderly people improves response to delayed-type hypersensitivity skin testing (DTH), an indicator of immune function, and antibody response to hepatitis B, tetanus and diphtheria, and pneumococcal vaccines ( 4676 , 4689 , 4690 , 4691 ). But whether vitamin E supplementation results in better health in elderly people is unknown. Neuroprotective effects Small clinical studies in patients with diabetes show that taking a specific tocotrienol-rich vitamin E supplement (Tocovid SupraBio, Hovid Nutriworld) for up to 1 year seems to modestly increase nerve conduction velocity when compared with placebo ( 104427 , 107388 ). Renal effects Some researchers think the antioxidant activity of vitamin E may slow progression of renal disease. Oxidative metabolites may accumulate in renal dysfunction. Vitamin E could theoretically slow the rate of decline in chronic inflammatory kidney diseases such as IgA nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and glomerulosclerosis; and poisoning by nephrotoxic drugs and other compounds ( 10369 ). Furthermore, there has been some speculation that vitamin E intake might reduce the risk of renal cell carcinoma. Some population research shows that vitamin E intake is associated with a reduced risk of kidney cancer or renal cell carcinoma ( 98262 ).",
