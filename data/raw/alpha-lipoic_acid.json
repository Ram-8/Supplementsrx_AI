Oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg daily seems to improve symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in patients with diabetes. Its benefits in patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy are unclear. Several clinical studies show that taking alpha-lipoic acid, either alone or in combination with gamma-lipoic acid, superoxide dismutase, or vitamin B12, seems to improve neuropathic sensory symptoms such as burning, pain, numbness, and prickling of the feet and legs, as well as objective measures such as ratings of neurological deficit and disability. Symptom improvement seems to occur within 3 to 5 weeks of oral or intravenous dosing ( 3540 , 3541 , 3557 , 3868 , 10148 , 12106 , 20473 , 20475 , 20478 , 20480 )( 20481 , 20484 , 20488 , 90447 , 103333 , 111429 , 111703 , 113894 ). A meta-analysis of 10 clinical studies in adults with diabetic polyneuropathy shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg daily for 3 weeks to 2 years reduces the incidence, severity, and frequency of sensory symptoms and improves measures of impairment and neurological disability but does not improve vibration perception threshold or measures of nerve conduction when compared with placebo ( 111703 ). Additionally, a similar meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily improves neuropathy symptoms as assessed with the Total Symptom Score (TSS) when compared with placebo ( 113894 ). However, another meta-analysis of 6 studies in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes, that includes some of the same studies, shows that giving alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg daily orally or intravenously for 3-8 weeks does not improve neuropathic pain when compared with placebo ( 112937 ). Likewise, a Cochrane systematic review of 3 clinical studies in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes shows that alpha-lipoic acid given intravenously and orally has little to no benefit on neuropathy symptoms after 6 months as assessed with the TSS or on impairment as assessed with the Neuropathy Impairment Score-Lower Limbs when compared with placebo ( 113897 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in conjunction with other treatments for diabetic neuropathy. Meta-analyses of 2-9 clinical studies in patients with diabetic neuropathy shows that intravenous alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily in combination with vitamin B12 and epalrestat for 3-8 weeks improves sensory and motor nerve conduction velocity and vibration perception thresholds in the lower limbs when compared with control groups receiving either conventional therapy or the vitamin B12 and epalrestat combination alone ( 113896 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, all studies were conducted in China and so it is unclear if results can be extrapolated to other geographic regions and populations. Across the various studies, alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg taken by mouth daily in one to three divided doses has been used ( 3540 , 3541 , 3868 , 20475 , 20478 , 103333 , 111429 , 113897 ). A specific combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg and superoxide dismutase 140 IU (ALA600 SOD, Alfa Wassermann) has also been used ( 20488 ). Intravenously, alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg and 1200 mg daily have been used ( 3540 , 3541 , 3557 , 10148 , 20480 , 20481 , 20484 , 113897 ). In one study, a specific product (Thiotacid, Eva Pharma) was used ( 103333 ). However, some preliminary clinical research shows that lower doses of alpha-lipoic acid are ineffective for improving nerve conduction velocity or subjective complaints of neuropathy ( 3869 , 20479 , 20482 , 20486 , 20487 ). Also, although there is some preliminary evidence that taking alpha-lipoic acid improves nerve function indices, such as Valsalva maneuver, Ewing's tests, or electrocardiogram measurements in patients with a specific type of diabetic neuropathy called cardiac autonomic neuropathy, taking alpha-lipoic acid orally does not improve clinical symptoms ( 3542 , 20483 , 20485 , 96223 , 107892 ). more Hyperlipidemia. Oral alpha-lipoic acid seems to reduce levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in certain populations. However, it is unclear whether alpha-lipoic acid is clinically beneficial in patients with hyperlipidemia. A meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-1200 mg daily for up to 16 weeks decreases total cholesterol by 10 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol by 9 mg/dL, but does not seem to improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglycerides, when compared with placebo ( 100709 ). Another meta-analysis of clinical research in various patient populations shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-1200 mg daily for 2-16 weeks decreases levels of total cholesterol by 11 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol by 11 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 31 md/dL when compared with placebo. It is unclear whether dose or treatment duration affect these outcomes ( 107885 ). These findings are limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies and patient populations. Also, a single study included in these meta-analyses provided alpha-lipoic acid intravenously. Other clinical trials have investigated the effect of alpha-lipoic acid on plasma lipids. In a large group of generally healthy adults, taking alpha-lipoic acid 800-1200 mg daily for 4 years reduces levels of total and LDL cholesterol, as well as triglycerides, when compared to baseline. The 1200 mg daily dose was more effective than the 400 mg daily dose ( 104650 ). Furthermore, an additional clinical study in adults with gestational diabetes, most of whom had elevated cholesterol levels at baseline, shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid (Puritan's Pride) 100 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces triglycerides, but does not improve levels of total, HDL, or LDL cholesterol, when compared with placebo ( 107890 ). The validity of this study is limited due to short duration of treatment. However, there is contrasting evidence in overweight or obese adults. A meta-analysis of several clinical studies in this population shows that ALA does not improve levels of HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, or triglycerides when compared with placebo. ALA 300-1800 mg daily was taken for 4-24 weeks in most of the included studies ( 116614 ). These findings are limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies and patient populations. Also, a single study included in this meta-analysis provided alpha-lipoic acid intravenously. The reason for the discrepant findings could be contributed to the heterogeneity among the included clinical studies, including existing comorbidities in the patient populations and the incorporation of dietary and exercise programs. Also, while many patients in these studies may have had elevated lipid levels at baseline, none of the studies specifically evaluated patients with hyperlipidemia. Thus, the benefits of alpha-lipoic acid in these patients is unclear. more Obesity. Most research shows that oral alpha-lipoic acid seems to improve weight loss by a small amount. While individual clinical studies show mixed results ( 21674 , 97630 , 100710 , 103327 , 103334 ), meta-analyses of clinical research show that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-1800 mg daily for 2-48 weeks can modestly reduce body weight by 0.7-2.3 kg and body mass index (BMI) by up to 0.5 kg/m2 when compared with placebo in overweight individuals or patients with obesity. The magnitude of these improvements are not dependent on the dose or duration of treatment ( 96231 , 96232 , 103332 , 111294 ). While these improvements are statistically significant, they may not be clinically meaningful. In addition, a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in adults with obesity shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-600 mg orally daily for 8-10 weeks improves some markers of insulin resistance, but not blood pressure or cholesterol levels ( 111294 ). Taking alpha-lipoic acid might also reduce body weight in overweight children or children with obesity. In adolescents aged 10-17 years, clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily for 3 months reduces body weight by 3.2 kg when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on blood lipids or fasting blood glucose ( 103330 ). Also, a small clinical study in children 8-16 years of age shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Tiobec 800, Laborest) 800 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve body weight, BMI, blood pressure, blood lipids, glycemic control, insulin resistance, or endothelial function when compared with placebo ( 100708 ). However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference in many of these outcomes. more Possibly Ineffective Alcohol-related liver disease. Oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to improve liver function in patients with alcohol-related liver disease. Taking alpha-lipoic acid orally 300 mg daily for up to 6 months does not appear to improve liver function or reduce liver damage when compared with placebo in patients with alcohol-related liver disease ( 3880 , 21678 ). more Altitude sickness. Oral alpha-lipoic acid, in combination with vitamins C and E, does not seem to be beneficial for altitude sickness prevention or treatment. Clinical research in healthy volunteers ascending to 5200 meters shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg in combination with vitamin C 1 gram and vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) 400 IU in four divided doses daily, beginning on the day of travel to high altitude and continuing for 2 weeks thereafter, does not prevent the occurrence nor decrease the severity of altitude sickness when compared with placebo ( 20499 ). more Contrast induced nephropathy. Oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to prevent nephropathy after undergoing coronary angiography. In diabetic patients at low risk for contrast induced nephropathy, alpha-lipoic acid (Thioactacid 600 mg RH, MEDA Manufacturing GmbH) 600 mg taken 30 minutes prior to and 24 and 48 hours after undergoing coronary angiography, with or without standard hydration therapy, does not reduce the risk of contrast induced nephropathy when compared with standard hydration therapy ( 90442 ). In addition, treatment with alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally every 8 hours beginning the afternoon prior to angiography and continuing for 2 days does not attenuate the maximum increase in serum creatinine or reduce the incidence of contrast induced nephropathy in most patients when compared with standard hydration therapy alone ( 90446 ). more Diabetes. Oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to be beneficial for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although some conflicting findings from individual studies exist, the overall evidence does not support the use of oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid for improving glycemic control or insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 3545 , 3874 , 3875 , 3876 , 20490 , 20493 , 20494 , 20495 , 20496 , 90443 )( 90445 , 110118 , 111305 ). A meta-analysis of 16 small clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 200-1200 mg daily for up to 52 weeks leads to slight improvements in glycemic control and body weight, but these improvements are not clinically significant. When compared with placebo, alpha-lipoic acid reduced fasting blood glucose by 6 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.17%, body weight by 0.7 kg, and body mass index (BMI) by 1.1 kg/m2. While triglyceride levels were reduced by 19 mg/dL, improvements in other lipids levels and blood pressure were lacking ( 110118 ). A specific alpha-lipoic acid product administered orally or intravenously in some of these studies was Thioctacid (Asta Medica) ( 3874 , 3875 , 3876 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in patients with gestational diabetes or type 1 diabetes. A small clinical study in adults with gestational diabetes shows the taking alpha-lipoic acid (Puritan's Pride) 100 mg daily for 8 weeks improves fasting blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity but does not affect HbA1C when compared with placebo ( 107890 ). The validity of this study is limited due to its short duration, which was likely inadequate to detect a change in HbA1c. Also, one small clinical study in adolescent patients with type 1 diabetes who show signs of early stage diabetic cardiomyopathy shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily for 4 months, in combination with insulin therapy, improves left ventricular systolic and diastolic function ( 90443 ). more Diabetic retinopathy. Oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to prevent macular edema in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Some research shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 24 months does not improve the incidence of clinically significant macular edema when compared with placebo in patients with mild to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy ( 20491 ). more HIV/AIDS-related dementia. Oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to improve cognitive impairment related to this condition. Clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily, alone or along with selegiline (Deprenyl), for 10 weeks may worsen HIV-associated cognitive impairment and does not affect mood or functional status when compared with placebo in patients with confirmed HIV infection and evidence of cognitive impairment ( 1556 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Age-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for age-related cognitive decline. Preliminary clinical research in elderly adults shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve cognitive function scores when compared with baseline ( 111303 ). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for AMD. A small clinical trial shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Pure Encapsulations) 1200 mg daily for 18 months does not improve visual acuity or reduce the rate of atrophy when compared with placebo in patients with advanced AMD ( 103335 ). It is unclear if alpha-lipoic acid would be beneficial in patients with less severe symptoms of AMD. more Age-related testosterone deficiency. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A very small clinical study in males with overweight or obesity, mild erectile dysfunction, and normal to low androgen levels shows that taking a combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg, myo-inositol, folic acid, and apple (Sinopol Forte, Laborest) increases testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and measures of erectile dysfunction but not follicle-stimulating hormone or sperm parameters when compared to baseline ( 111674 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the small sample size and lack of a comparator group, and it is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Aging skin. Topical alpha-lipoic acid may be beneficial for aging skin. A small clinical study shows that applying a cream containing alpha-lipoic acid 5% to the face twice daily for 12 weeks reduces the fine lines and roughness associated with aging of facial skin when compared with a control cream ( 12021 ). more Alzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for this condition. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg once daily in combination with standard cholinesterase inhibitors may slow cognitive decline when compared with cholinesterase inhibitors alone in some patients with Alzheimer disease ( 20500 , 90437 ). However, higher-quality clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600-900 mg daily for up to 2 years, in combination with vitamin C and vitamin E, does not affect cognitive function when compared with placebo in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease ( 19206 , 20501 ). more Amanita mushroom poisoning. Evidence on the use of intravenous alpha-lipoic acid for amanita mushroom poisoning is limited to anecdotal reports. Intravenous alpha-lipoic acid has been used in combination with other treatments for poisoning from amanita mushroom ingestion. Its use is controversial. Reports are anecdotal, and experimental evidence does not support its effectiveness. Some researchers recommend against its use ( 105 , 1548 , 1549 , 3871 , 3879 ). more Anthracycline cardiotoxicity. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is effective for the prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity. A small clinical study in patients with breast cancer receiving doxorubicin shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 6 months does not improve ejection fraction but does decrease levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a marker of ventricular hypertrophy, when compared with placebo ( 110112 ). more Antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is effective for the prevention or treatment of antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. A very small, open-label study in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily along with conventional antipsychotic therapy for 12 weeks reduces prolactin levels by 51% when compared to baseline ( 110116 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. more Antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects. Small clinical studies suggest that oral alpha-lipoic acid does not seem to improve antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects in patients with schizophrenia. A very small, open-label study in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily along with conventional antipsychotic therapy for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose levels by around 17 mg/dL but actually increases glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.14% when compared to baseline. No improvements in body weight or lipid levels were reported ( 110116 ). Another small clinical study in patients with schizophrenia stabilized on antipsychotic therapy for at least 1 year shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve body mass index (BMI) when compared with placebo ( 110115 ). more Aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer and aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia shows that taking a specific combination product (Opera, Gamfarma Srl) containing alpha-lipoic acid 240 mg, Boswellia serrata 40 mg, methylsulfonylmethane 200 mg, and bromelain 20 mg once daily for 6 months reduces arthralgia intensity when compared to baseline, with around 22% of patients having complete symptom resolution at the end of the study ( 109570 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group. more Atrial fibrillation. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for atrial fibrillation. Clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 12 months does not reduce the recurrence of atrial fibrillation when compared with placebo in patients who underwent a catheter ablation procedure. However, there was a decrease in the need for antiarrhythmic drugs in patients receiving alpha-lipoic acid ( 97628 ). more Back pain. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. An observational study in adults with chronic lower back pain and sciatica suggests that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg, palmitoylethanolamide 600 mg, and myrrh 200 mg daily for 30 days, along with periradicular infiltrations of oxygen-ozone, is associated with resolution of pain in 17% more patients when compared with periradicular steroid infiltrations at 60 days ( 111308 ). However, it is unclear if this effect is due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Beta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for reducing iron accumulation in beta-thalassemia major. A small, crossover study in patients with beta-thalassemia major who are receiving iron chelation therapy shows that adding oral alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg before breakfast or dinner for 8 weeks reduces levels of serum ferritin when compared with placebo ( 107888 ). Serum ferritin was reduced by 104 ng/mL and 38 ng/mL in the treatment and placebo groups, respectively. The validity of this finding is limited due to the small, exploratory nature of the study. more Bipolar disorder. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research shows that taking acetyl-L-carnitine 1000 mg plus alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg up to three times daily for 12 weeks does not improve depression when compared with placebo in patients with type I or type II bipolar disorder ( 90441 ). more Burning mouth syndrome. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for burning mouth syndrome. A meta-analysis of nine small, low-quality clinical trials in patients with burning mouth syndrome shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 400-800 mg daily for up to 2 months does not reduce pain intensity when compared with placebo or active controls such as multivitamins, Biotene mouth rinse, capsaicin, laser therapy, clonazepam, or pregabalin. However, in an analysis of three placebo-controlled studies, alpha-lipoic acid increased the likelihood of any burning mouth syndrome-related symptom improvement by 92% when compared with placebo ( 110111 ). Individual studies, most of which were included in the analysis, show conflicting results overall ( 20474 , 21661 , 21662 , 21663 , 21664 , 21665 , 21666 , 111427 ). One small clinical trial shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily improves symptoms of burning mouth syndrome in patients who had never previously been treated with anxiolytics or antidepressants, but not in those who had received these prior treatments ( 21668 ). This suggests that alpha-lipoic acid may improve symptoms of burning mouth syndrome resulting from stress, but not from depression or drug-induced hyposalivation. more Cancer. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for preventing or treating cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for preventing or treating CVD, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. Carpal tunnel syndrome. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for carpal tunnel syndrome, either before or after surgery. In patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 60 days reduces pain by a moderate amount when compared with not taking alpha-lipoic acid, but with no effect on functionality ( 103328 ). In patients with neuropathic pain due to carpal tunnel syndrome, giving alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg intravenously daily for 30 days, then 600 mg orally daily for 60 days, decreases pain on a visual analog scale, and improves functionality when compared with oral alpha-lipoic acid alone, or no treatment ( 112938 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. One study shows that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg and gamma-linolenic acid 360 mg for 90 days improves functional scores and subjective symptom scores when compared to baseline ( 21653 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Another clinical study in adults with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome shows that taking a combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, phosphatidylserine, turmeric, and vitamins C, E, B1, B2, B6, and B12 twice daily for 60 days reduces symptom severity and pain but does not improve measures of hand and wrist function when compared with control ( 111702 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding. The study may also be inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. Additionally, it is unclear if the effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in patients who have undergone carpal tunnel release surgery. Taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 40 days starting immediately after surgery does not improve the rate of nerve recovery when compared with placebo, although it seems to reduce the occurrence of post-operative pillar pain, which is a common complication of carpal tunnel release surgery ( 96233 ). more Cataracts. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for cataracts, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. Cervical dysplasia. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with cervical dysplasia. A small clinical study in patients with low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 3 months reduces the proportion of patients with intraepithelial neoplasia by 95% when compared with placebo ( 110113 ). more Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of oral alpha-lipoic acid for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. One clinical study shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg three times daily for 24 weeks during treatment with cisplatin or oxaliplatin does not affect the symptoms or severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy when compared with placebo ( 90439 ). However, another small clinical study in patients with breast cancer receiving paclitaxel shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 6 months reduces the severity of peripheral neuropathy when compared with placebo ( 110112 ). The reason for this disparate finding is unclear, but it may be due to differences in chemotherapy regimens. Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study shows that taking a specific product (Opera, Gamfarma s.r.l.) containing alpha-lipoic acid 240 mg, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) 200 mg, Boswellia serrata 40 mg, and bromelain 20 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces overall pain when compared to baseline in adults with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( 96449 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group. Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally once daily and ipidacrine 20 mg orally three times daily throughout 6 paclitaxel-based chemotherapy cycles improves sensory nerve action potential parameters when compared with control ( 111292 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. Chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for CKD. Preliminary clinical research in patients with stage 2 or 3 CKD related to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 1.6 grams daily for 6 months has modest benefits on biochemical markers and cognitive tests when compared to control. Taking alpha-lipoic acid reduces serum glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and uric acid levels, and improves insulin resistance and flow-mediated dilation and cognitive test results. However, there was no effect on intima media thickness or the ankle brachial index ( 101867 ). more Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery shows that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg, coenzyme Q10 100 mg, magnesium orotate 400 mg, and omega-3 fatty acids 300 mg three times daily, with selenium 200 mcg once daily, for up to 2 months prior and 1 month after surgery, decreases plasma troponin levels and reduces the average postoperative hospital stay by 1.2 days when compared with placebo ( 21651 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to alpha-lipoic acid, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with persistent loss of the sense of smell after COVID-19 infection. In adults with sense of smell loss persisting for more than 3 months after COVID-19 infection, adding alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily orally for 12 weeks to olfactory training reduces the incidence of anosmia, and improves the olfactory threshold, the sense of smell measured on a visual analog scale, and the smell identification score by a similar amount to placebo ( 112935 ). Additionally, a small clinical trial in adults with persistent olfactory dysfunction and treatment refractory parosmia due to previous COVID-19 infection shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg daily for 6 months in combination with olfactory training does not improve tests of odor threshold, detection, and identification or reduce patient-reported symptoms of parosmia when compared with olfactory training alone ( 113892 ). more Diabetic nephropathy. When used in combination with certain conventional medications, intravenous or oral alpha-lipoic acid may improve some measures of albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Preliminary clinical research shows that intravenous alpha-lipoic acid (YantaiZhichu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) 450 mg plus intravenous alprostadil 20 mcg once daily for 14 days reduces urinary albumin excretion rate by 23% and cystatin C levels by 19% when compared with alprostadil alone ( 96221 ). Patients treated with alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg intravenously plus valsartan 80 mg orally once daily for 14 days showed a 25% lower urinary albumin excretion rate and a 27% and 31% lower serum level of beta2-microglobulin and cystatin C, respectively, when compared with patients treated with valsartan alone ( 101866 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research in adults with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg, 450 mg, or 600 mg daily in combination with oral valsartan 80 mg daily for 14 days reduces urinary albumin excretion rate, as well as levels of urinary albumin and serum beta 2-microglobulin, when compared with either valsartan or alpha-lipoic acid alone ( 107891 ). These findings are limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies and the presence of potential publication bias. Additionally, the long-term benefits of alpha-lipoic acid are unclear. Another meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with diabetes shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily in conjunction with other medications (e.g. antihypertensives, vitamin B6) for 3-18 months reduces levels of urine albumin, but does not improve urinary albumin excretion rate, when compared with placebo. Notably, alpha-lipoic acid alone did not affect outcomes ( 107886 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the high heterogeneity of the included studies; additionally, the quality of evidence was considered low to moderate. more Dry eye. It is unclear if topical alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with dry eye. A small clinical study in patients with diabetes and dry eye symptoms shows that application of an eye drop containing alpha-lipoic acid 0.1% and hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) 0.3% three times daily for 2 months does not improve subjective or objective measures of dry eye symptoms when compared with HPMC alone ( 110119 ). more Dysmenorrhea. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for dysmenorrhea. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally daily, with or without mefenamic acid 250 mg daily, for 5 days starting before menstruation reduces pain associated with moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea by approximately 24% and 44%, respectively, when compared to baseline ( 101871 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Erectile dysfunction (ED). It is unclear if oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for ED. Preliminary clinical research in males with diabetes and ED shows that intravenous alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg with alprostadil 10 mcg once daily for 14 days improves the quality and frequency of erection in 95% of patients, compared with only 81% of those taking tadalafil 5 mg orally daily ( 96224 ). It is not clear if this improvement is due to alpha-lipoic acid, alprostadil, or the combination. Another very small study in males with mild ED, overweight or obesity, and normal to low androgen levels shows that taking a combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg, myo-inositol, folic acid, and apple (Sinopol Forte, Laborest) improves measures of erectile dysfunction when compared to baseline ( 111674 ). The validity of these finding is limited by the small sample size and the lack of a comparator group, and it is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Fibromyalgia. It is unclear if intravenous alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for fibromyalgia. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (SiSU Vita Health) 600-1800 mg daily for 4 weeks does not reduce pain intensity when compared with placebo in patients with fibromyalgia ( 104655 ). Alpha lipoic acid has also been studied as a combination therapy for fibromyalgia. Preliminary clinical research in adults with fibromyalgia shows that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid and pregabalin for 6 weeks does not improve pain or depression scores when compared with either product alone ( 111428 ). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Glaucoma. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in adults with open-angle glaucoma shows that taking a combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg, omega-3 fatty acids 2240 mg, vitamin C 180 mg, vitamin E 27.9 mg, lutein 10 mg, zeaxanthin 2 mg, zinc 15 mg, copper 1 mg, and taurine 150 mg (NuaDHA Vision, Nua Biological) orally daily for 6 months does not improve intraocular pressure when compared with baseline ( 111310 ). more Heart failure. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in patients with heart failure participating in a handgrip exercise shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid, vitamin E, and vitamin C reduces mean arterial pressure by about 6 mmHg and reduces vascular resistance by about 12% when compared with placebo ( 19219 ). The first dose consisted of vitamin E 200 IU, vitamin C 500 mg, and alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg. The subsequent dose consisted of vitamin E 400 IU, vitamin C 500 mg, and alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg ( 19219 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Hemorrhoids. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for hemorrhoids. A preliminary open-label clinical trial shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 200 mg daily for 12 weeks decreases anal pain while sitting, pain at defecation, itching, and bleeding when compared with no treatment in patients with second- and third-degree hemorrhoids ( 100707 ). The validity of these results is limited by a lack of blinding and placebo control. more Herniated disc. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small observational study in adults with acute lumbosacral radiculopathy secondary to lumbar disc herniation shows that taking a combination supplement containing alpha-lipoic acid 404 mg, myrrh, and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) (Tiobec Dol, Uriach Italy Srl) twice daily for 4 weeks, along with steroids and as needed opioids, reduces pain and disability and improves physical but not mental health as it pertains to quality of life when compared with steroids and as needed opioids alone ( 111711 ). However, it is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more HIV/AIDS. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for patients with HIV/AIDS who are unresponsive to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A small clinical study in patients who were unresponsive to HAART shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Alpha Lipoic Sustain 300, Jarrow Formulas) 300 mg three times daily for 6 months improves lymphocyte proliferation and whole blood glutathione levels when compared with placebo. However, there was no change in HIV RNA levels or CD4 count ( 21655 ). more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for hypertension. Clinical research in a small number of patients with mild (stage I) hypertension shows that adding alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily to quinapril 40 mg daily for 8 weeks does not significantly decrease blood pressure when compared with quinapril alone ( 21656 ). A meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials shows that alpha-lipoic acid lowers systolic blood pressure by a mean of about 5 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure by a mean of about 3 mmHg, but there is significant heterogeneity between the studies. The small decrease in blood pressure is also only seen with doses of alpha-lipoic acid below 800 mg daily when given for 12 weeks or less ( 112934 ). more Hypertriglyceridemia. Clinical studies suggest that oral alpha-lipoic acid does not reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, however it might be beneficial in certain populations. In overweight adults with elevated triglycerides, taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 24 weeks does not reduce triglyceride levels when compared with placebo ( 103327 ). In addition, a meta-analysis of 11 clinical trials in patients with or without hypertriglyceridemia at baseline shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300-1200 mg daily for up to 16 weeks does not improve triglyceride levels when compared with placebo ( 100709 ). However, one clinical study in adults with gestational diabetes, most of whom had elevated triglyceride levels at baseline, shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Puritan's Pride) 100 mg daily for 8 weeks reduces triglyceride levels by 30 mg/dL, compared with an increase of 5 mg/dL in those taking placebo, a difference that was statistically significant ( 107890 ). The validity of this study is limited due to short duration of treatment. more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral or intravenous alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for prediabetes. A small clinical study in patients with prediabetes shows that intravenous alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 2 weeks decreases postprandial plasma glucose, steady state plasma insulin, cholesterol, and fatty acid levels and increases insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo ( 21657 ). In a large group of generally healthy adults, taking alpha-lipoic acid 800-1200 mg for 4 years reduces levels of fasting plasma glucose when compared with baseline. The 1200 mg daily dose was more effective than the 400 mg daily dose ( 104650 ). While some patients in this study had prediabetes or impaired fasting glucose at baseline, the study did not specifically evaluate patients with prediabetes. more Infertility. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid to increase the chance of pregnancy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for infertility. Interstitial cystitis. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. In individuals with vulval pain associated with painful bladder syndrome, clinical research shows that taking a specific product containing alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg, docosahexaenoic acid 250 mg, eicosapentaenoic acid 16.67 mg, vitamin E 12 mg, vitamin D 5 mg, and magnesium 56.25 mg (ALAnerv Age; Alfa Wassermann) daily in combination with amitriptyline up to 30 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces pelvic pain between 15% to 49% more than amitriptyline alone. Also, use of the combination supplement more than doubled the number of patients with an improvement in pain during intercourse ( 97629 ). It is unclear if the benefit is associated with alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Lyme disease. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for Lyme disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. Male infertility. Most clinical studies suggest that oral alpha-lipoic acid might improve some sperm characteristics in males with infertility. However, it is unclear whether alpha-lipoic acid improves pregnancy or live birth rates in these individuals. A meta-analysis of 5 moderate-quality clinical studies in males with infertility shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 80-90 days modestly increases sperm progressive and total motility and reduces abnormal sperm morphology when compared with placebo. However, sperm concentration, sperm vitality, semen volume, and pregnancy rates show no significant improvements when compared with placebo ( 116615 ). Another small clinical study in males with infertility due to high levels of sperm DNA damage shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 80 days does not improve pregnancy rate, sperm motility, sperm concentration, semen volume, or other measures of sperm health when compared with placebo ( 110109 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in males with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) shows that taking one tablet daily of a specific product (Fertiplus SOD, Idi-Pharma) containing alpha-lipoic acid, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and other nutrients 30 days prior to IVF procedures improves the pregnancy rate from 9% of all embryo transfers pre-treatment to 45% and reduces the rate of miscarriage when compared to baseline ( 97627 ). It is unclear if the benefit is associated with alpha-lipoic acid, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome. Preliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally daily for 12 weeks modestly improved serum triglyceride levels, but not serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, when compared with placebo ( 111307 ). However, the study may have been inadequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Migraine headache. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with migraine headaches. A meta-analysis of two small, moderate-quality clinical studies in adults in Iran and Belgium with migraine shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 3 months reduces migraine frequency by approximately 1 per month and improves migraine severity, but not migraine duration when compared with placebo ( 115873 ). However, clinical significance is unlikely. Furthermore, the validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity across clinical studies. A small clinical study, not included in the above meta-analysis, in adults with migraine shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg twice daily for 6 months reduces migraine frequency by at least 50% in 69% of patients and reduces the need for migraine treatment by 56% when compared to baseline, although the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group ( 96229 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in adolescents for migraine prophylaxis. A small open-label study in adolescents aged 10-19 years with a history of migraine shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg with flunarizine 5 mg as prophylaxis daily for 12 weeks reduces the frequency of migraine attacks and reduces monthly migraine headache days by 9 days, but does not reduce migraine severity or measures of disability when compared with flunarizine alone. For every 3 patients treated with alpha-lipoic acid and flunarizine over flunarizine alone, 1 additional patient had a 50% or greater reduction in migraine frequency ( 111706 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding. more Miscarriage. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in pregnant adults with threatened miscarriage between the 6 th and 13 th week of gestation shows that taking a specific combination product (DAV HA, Lo.Li pharma s.r.l) containing alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg, hyaluronic acid, magnesium, vitamin B6, and vitamin D daily in combination with conventional treatment of vaginal progesterone over 2 weeks of observation results in a faster resorption of the subchorionic hematoma and faster decrease of patient-reported vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and uterine contractions when compared with vaginal progesterone alone ( 113893 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo for the control group. more Muscle strength. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid prevents a loss of muscle strength after exercise. In athletes, a small clinical trial shows that taking a single dose of alpha-lipoic acid 150 mg (Athenion GmbH) after an intensive load protocol does not prevent loss of leg strength approximately 24 hours later when compared with placebo. However, taking the same dose for 2 days, followed by 300 mg daily during a 6-day training protocol, results in the maintenance of leg strength, compared with a loss in those taking placebo ( 104652 ). more Neck pain. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg plus superoxide dismutase 140 IU once daily for 2 months, along with physiotherapy, reduces chronic neck pain in approximately 50% more patients when compared with physiotherapy alone ( 90440 ). more Neuropathic pain. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial in patients with neuropathic pain. In patients with peripheral neuropathies, taking alpha-lipoic acid orally, up to 1800 mg daily for 6 weeks, is less effective for reducing pain intensity scores and improving quality of life than pregabalin, taken orally in doses up to 450 mg daily ( 112940 ). A nonblinded clinical study in patients with refractory chronic lumbosacral radicular pain shows that taking alpha lipoic acid orally, 600 mg three times daily for 3 weeks followed by 600 mg daily for 2 weeks, in addition to a single, pulsed radiofrequency treatment to the dorsal ganglion, improves pain severity and disability scores at 6 months when compared with pulsed radiofrequency treatment alone. A pain score of less than 4 is achieved at 12 weeks in about 80% of patients taking alpha lipoic acid, compared with about 65% of patients without alpha-lipoic acid. ( 107895 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for NAFLD. Small clinical studies in adults with NAFLD and obesity show that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally twice daily for 8-12 weeks does not improve liver health markers, such as liver function test levels or liver steatosis, cholesterol levels, body weight, or visceral fat when compared with placebo or control ( 104660 , 100710 , 111304 ). However, these clinical trials show that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg orally twice daily for 8-12 weeks may provide small improvements in interleukin-6 levels, adiponectin levels, and insulin resistance ( 104660 , 100710 ). However, these studies may have been inadequately powered to detect differences in some of these outcomes. more Orthostatic hypotension. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for orthostatic hypotension. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 430-788 mg orally daily for a mean of 2.3 years attenuates changes in blood pressure upon standing when compared with baseline in some patients with chronic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension or orthostatic intolerance ( 101868 ). more Osteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for osteoarthritis. A small nonrandomized study in adults with osteoarthritis and type 2 diabetes shows that taking alpha lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 6 weeks with standard therapy (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications) improves patient-reported assessment of pain and functionality when compared with standard therapy alone ( 115743 ). However, clinical significance is unclear, and the validity of these results is limited due to the lack of statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons. more Pain (chronic). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for various chronic pain conditions. A clinical study in patients with untreated, mild to moderate idiopathic pain (i.e. neuropathic pain, joint pain, and muscle pain with unknown etiology) shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg once or twice daily for 2 months may improve pain severity when compared with baseline, with greater effects observed with daily doses of 800 mg ( 107887 ). Although the study enrolled a control group, a statistical comparison between groups was not conducted, limiting the validity of this finding. Additionally, sub-analyses evaluating outcomes based on type of chronic pain were not conducted. more Periodontitis. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with moderate or advanced periodontitis shows that taking a supplement containing alpha-lipoic acid 25 mg, coenzyme Q10, cranberry extract, grapeseed extract, selenium, vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc twice daily for 8 weeks in addition to standard nonsurgical therapy does not reduce periodontal indices including bleeding on probing, gingival recession, plaque index, or inflammation, among others, when compared with placebo ( 111708 ). more Peripheral arterial disease (PAD). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for PAD. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily reduces pain associated with exercise in people with PAD and claudication when compared with placebo. However, exercise tolerance does not seem to improve ( 16391 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for PCOS. Alpha-lipoic acid has been studied alone and in combination with inositol for the treatment of PCOS. A meta-analysis of 7 clinical trials in young adults with overweight and PCOS shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600-1800 mg daily for 6-25 weeks, alone or in combination with inositol, reduces fasting blood sugar and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) when compared with control. However, there is no effect on insulin levels, body mass index, lipid profile, or hormone levels ( 112939 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in a number of retrospective observational studies for PCOS. A small retrospective study in patients with PCOS and overweight or obesity suggests that taking alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg daily for 12 weeks is associated with improved insulin sensitivity, hepatic insulin extraction index, and levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase when compared to baseline. However, levels of reproductive hormones did not change over the 12 weeks ( 113895 ). Other observational research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 2000 mg, alone or in combination with myo-inositol (Sinopol, Laborest s.r.l.) 800-1000 mg, daily for 3-24 months is associated with reduced insulin levels and reduced menstrual cycle length, but not weight loss or improvements in hirsutism or insulin resistance, when compared to baseline ( 101869 , 101870 ). Another observational study shows that taking alpha lipoic acid 800 mg with a higher dose of myo-inositol 2000 mg is associated with slightly greater weight loss when compared with myo-inositol 1000 mg daily ( 103751 ). Also, taking alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not affect levels of reproductive hormones, although improvements occur when alpha-lipoic acid is taken in combination with inositol 1000 mg daily ( 101870 ). The validity of this research is limited by the retrospective nature of the studies. Additionally, all of observational studies were conducted in Italy, which may limit generalizability of findings to other geographic regions and populations. more Preterm labor. It is unclear if vaginal alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for preventing preterm birth. Preliminary clinical research shows that administering alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg vaginally once nightly for 30 days after an episode of preterm labor prevents cervical shortening when compared with placebo ( 96226 ). It is unclear if these findings are associated with a reduction in the rate of preterm birth. more Radiation exposure. Oral alpha-lipoic acid might reduce radiation levels in children living in areas contaminated with radiation. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 400 mg, alone or in combination with vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol) 200 mg, daily for 28 days reduces chemiluminescence in leukocytes and urinary radioactivity when compared to baseline in children living in areas contaminated with radiation ( 21669 ). more Schizophrenia. There is mixed evidence regarding the effectiveness of oral alpha-lipoic acid in patients with schizophrenia. A small clinical study in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia receiving conventional antipsychotic therapy shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 300 mg daily for 8 weeks improves scores related to negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but not positive symptoms, when compared with placebo ( 110114 ). A very small, open-label study in patients with stable, chronic schizophrenia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg daily along with ongoing antipsychotic medication for 4 months improves symptoms by 64% when compared to baseline. Specific symptom domains, including negative and positive symptoms, excitement, depressive symptoms, and extrapyramidal symptoms all show improvement, although the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a control group ( 96228 ). In contrast, another small clinical study in patients with schizophrenia stabilized on antipsychotic therapy for at least 1 year shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 100 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve symptoms of schizophrenia or cognitive function when compared with placebo ( 110115 ). Also, a very small, open-label study in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily along with conventional antipsychotic therapy for 12 weeks does not improve positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia when compared to baseline ( 110116 ). A meta-analysis of 4 studies in patients with clinically stable schizophrenia does not show any benefit of oral alpha-lipoic acid when compared with placebo, although details of the analysis are limited ( 112936 ). Overall, the reasons for the disparate research findings are unclear, but they may be due to differences in the alpha-lipoic acid dose, treatment duration, and severity of schizophrenia across studies. Alpha-lipoic acid has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in patients who responded well to antipsychotic therapy after a single episode of psychosis shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 150 mg, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 1000 mg, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 500 mg twice daily does not prevent 2-year cumulative relapse or delay relapse time when compared with placebo ( 90675 ). more Sciatica. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for sciatica. Preliminary clinical research in patients with sciatica secondary to a herniated disc shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Byodiniral 300 QR, MDM SpA) 600 mg daily for 60 days improves signs and symptoms of sciatica and decreases the use of analgesics when compared with taking acetyl-L-carnitine (Nicetile, SigmaTau Ind. Farm. Riunite SpA) 1180 mg daily ( 21671 ). However, taking alpha-lipoic acid does not affect sleep quality in these patients. Alpha-lipoic acid has also been studied in combination with other ingredients for sciatica. Observational research in patients with sciatic pain due to herniated discs suggests that taking a combination of alpha-lipoic acid 800 mg, myrrh extract 200 mg, and palmitoylethanolamide 600 mg daily for 20 days along with 3 sessions of oxygen-ozone therapy over 30 days is associated with slight improvements in pain when compared with oxygen-ozone therapy alone ( 111113 ). It is unclear if the effects are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Tinnitus. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for tinnitus. A small observational study in patients with tinnitus associated with cochlear dysfunction and metabolic syndrome suggests that taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg for 60 days is associated with improvements in several audiometric parameters and overall tinnitus handicap inventory scores, with a larger effect on functional and emotional scores, when compared to baseline. However, patients with tinnitus secondary to acoustic nerve lesions do not appear to benefit from alpha-lipoic acid supplementation ( 111705 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of a comparator group. more Toxin-induced liver damage. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients being treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid 250 mg, coenzyme Q10 200 mg, and acetyl-L-carnitine 250 mg twice daily for 2 weeks reduces the risk of drug-induced liver injury by 73% when compared with placebo ( 107445 ). It is unclear if these findings are due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Vertigo. Oral alpha-lipoic acid has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in adults with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 20 ng/mL shows that taking a specific combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg, zinc 7.5 mg, L-carnosine 165 mg, curcumin 100 mg, piperine 1 mg, cholecalciferol 800 units, vitamin B2 0.8 mg, and vitamin B6 1 mg (Vertistop D, Difass) orally daily for 6 months moderately reduces the number of vertigo relapse episodes when compared with control. However, in patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels greater than 20 ng/mL that took a specific combination product containing alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg, zinc 7.5 mg, L-carnosine 165 mg, curcumin 100 mg and piperine 1 mg (Vertistop L, Difass) orally daily for 6 months there was no difference in relapse episodes when compared with control ( 111294 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Vitiligo. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for vitiligo when used in conjunction with phototherapy. When used in combination with phototherapy, clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid (Shandong Qidu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) 300 mg daily for 6 months does not improve repigmentation when compared with placebo ( 104654 ). In contrast, a small clinical study shows that taking two tablets of a specific combination product (Lipoacid Combi, General Topics) containing alpha-lipoic acid 50 mg, vitamin C 50 mg, vitamin E 20 mg, and polyunsaturated fatty acids 12%, starting 8 weeks prior to ultraviolet B phototherapy and continuing for 6 months during phototherapy treatment, seems to increase the likelihood of repigmentation by 29% when compared with placebo ( 19210 ). It is not clear if this effect is due to alpha-lipoic acid, other ingredients, or the combination. more Wilson disease. Although there is interest in using oral alpha-lipoic acid for Wilson disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. Wound healing. It is unclear if oral alpha-lipoic acid is beneficial for wound healing. A small clinical study shows that taking a specific alpha-lipoic acid product (Byodinoral 300, M.D.M. Spa) 300 mg one hour before and one hour after hyperbaric oxygen therapy administered daily for 14-30 days reduces wound area in 30% more patients with ischemic ulcers when compared with hyperbaric oxygen therapy alone ( 21677 ). more Wrinkled skin. Although there is interest in using topical alpha-lipoic acid for wrinkled skin, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of alpha-lipoic acid for this condition. More evidence is needed to rate alpha-lipoic acid for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately. Alpha-lipoic acid has been used with apparent safety in doses of up to 2 grams daily for 3 months to 2 years.

At least five cases of alpha-lipoic acid intoxication have been reported for children aged 14 months to 16 years who consumed alpha-lipoic acid at doses up to 226 mg/kg (approximately 2400 mg). Symptoms of alpha-lipoic acid-induced intoxication included seizures, acidosis, vomiting, and unconsciousness ( 90444 , 96227 , 96234 , 104653 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Alpha-lipoic acid has been used safely during pregnancy at doses up to 600 mg daily for up to 4 weeks ( 96222 ).

  "interactions_text": "Expand All | Collapse All ALKYLATING AGENTS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, the antioxidant effects of alpha-lipoic acid might alter the effectiveness of alkylating agents. The use of antioxidants like alpha-lipoic acid during chemotherapy is controversial. There are concerns that antioxidants could reduce the activity of chemotherapy drugs that generate free radicals ( 391 ). However, some researchers theorize that antioxidants might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that might interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells ( 14012 , 14013 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, antioxidants such as alpha-lipoic acid have on chemotherapy. Advise patients to consult their oncologist before using alpha-lipoic acid. more ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, alpha-lipoic acid may have antiplatelet effects and may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. In vitro, alpha-lipoic acid inhibits platelet aggregation ( 98682 ). more ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, taking alpha-lipoic acid with antidiabetes drugs might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Although some small clinical studies have suggested that alpha-lipoic acid can lower blood glucose levels ( 3545 , 3874 , 3875 , 3876 , 20490 , 20493 , 104650 ), larger clinical studies in patients with diabetes have shown no clinically meaningful effect ( 20494 , 20495 , 20496 , 90443 , 90445 , 110118 ). Additionally, co-administration of single doses of alpha-lipoic acid and glyburide or acarbose did not cause detectable drug interactions in healthy volunteers ( 3870 ). more ANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, the antioxidant effects of alpha-lipoic acid might alter the effectiveness of antitumor antibiotics. The use of antioxidants like alpha-lipoic acid during chemotherapy is controversial. There are concerns that antioxidants could reduce the activity of antitumor antibiotic drugs, which work by generating free radicals ( 391 ). However, some researchers theorize that antioxidants might make chemotherapy more effective by reducing oxidative stress that might interfere with apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells ( 14012 , 14013 ). More evidence is needed to determine what effect, if any, antioxidants such as alpha-lipoic acid have on chemotherapy involving antitumor antibiotics. Advise patients to consult their oncologist before using alpha-lipoic acid. more THYROID HORMONE Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, alpha-lipoic acid might decrease the effects of thyroid hormone drugs. Animal research suggests that co-administration of thyroxine with alpha-lipoic acid reduces conversion into the active T3 form ( 8946 ). more",
  "mechanism_text": "General Alpha-lipoic acid is about 30% absorbed from dietary or supplemental sources, and is reduced to dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) in many tissues ( 1561 , 3871 , 3872 ). Endogenous alpha-lipoic acid is a coenzyme that, together with pyrophosphatase, is involved in carbohydrate metabolism and in the mitochondrial citric acid cycle which produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ( 12021 , 107893 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Alpha-lipoic acid is a modulator of the inflammatory response and may suppress vascular inflammation ( 12021 , 16391 , 103327 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has also been shown to increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with multiple sclerosis when administered at a dose of 1200 mg ( 30892 ). Increased cAMP is believed to decrease inflammation and apoptosis. Also, taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily has been shown to reduce levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 in obese patients ( 21657 , 103330 ). In addition, negative correlations between insulin sensitivity index and levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 have been noted in obese patients with impaired glucose tolerance ( 21657 ). A meta-analysis of clinical research in various patient populations shows that taking oral alpha lipoic acid 300-1200 mg for 1-48 weeks reduces levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha when compared with placebo ( 107894 ). Although some research disagrees, alpha-lipoic acid also appears to reduce levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in human research ( 14010 , 104650 , 107889 , 107894 , 101867 , 115744 ). In vitro evidence shows that alpha-lipoic acid strongly suppresses proinflammatory TNF-alpha and IL-1beta-induced fractalkine expression in endothelial cells by suppressing the activities of nuclear factor-kappaB and specificity protein-1 ( 30826 ). Clinical research in females who have not delivered after an episode of preterm labor shows that alpha-lipoic acid increases the presence of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in the cervical fluid but does not alter the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( 96226 ). Alpha-lipoic acid also inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced monocyte activation and acute inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo by activating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway ( 30842 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to be an endogenous regulator of secretory phospholipase (PL) A2 enzyme activity and suppress inflammatory reactions ( 30838 ). Antineoplastic effects Alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to induce apoptosis in human colon cancer cells in vitro by increasing mitochondrial respiration ( 30818 ). Antioxidant effects Exogenous alpha-lipoic acid, and the metabolite DHLA, have antioxidant activity and can scavenge free radicals both intra- and extracellularly ( 3871 , 30922 ). Alpha-lipoic acid is both water and fat soluble and can regenerate endogenous antioxidants, such as vitamin E, vitamin C, and glutathione, and prevent oxidative damage ( 1547 , 1550 , 3546 , 3871 , 3885 , 30788 , 30916 , 30919 , 30923 , 30926 )( 30935 , 30936 , 30937 ). Preliminary data suggests that these antioxidant effects might provide protection in cerebral ischemia, excitotoxic amino acid brain injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, hypoxia-reoxygenation, muscle ischemia associated with peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, and other causes of damage to brain or neural tissue ( 1561 , 3546 , 3871 , 3877 , 10148 , 16391 , 30789 , 30847 , 30924 ). Alpha-lipoic acid has shown promise in experimental models to prevent aminoglycoside-induced cochlear damage, and metal (lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury) and chemical (hexachlorobenzene, n-hexane) poisoning ( 3871 , 3879 , 3881 , 3882 , 3883 , 3884 , 30921 ). Children treated with alpha-lipoic acid, alone or in combination with vitamin E, showed normalized organ function and lessened indices of oxidative damage following radiation exposure in the Chernobyl accident ( 3871 ). The antioxidant effects of alpha-lipoic acid might be beneficial in conditions in which oxidative stress is a factor, although effects may differ for each patient population ( 3879 , 107888 , 107889 , 107891 , 111306 ). A meta-analysis and other clinical research in adults with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 300-600 mg daily in combination with valsartan 80 mg and/or amlodipine daily for 14 days improves total antioxidant capacity and reduces levels of oxidative stress markers, such as superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde, when compared with valsartan or alpha-lipoic acid alone ( 107891 , 111306 ). A small, crossover study in patients with beta-thalassemia receiving standard iron chelation therapy shows that taking oral alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily for 8 weeks may decrease serum levels of malondialdehyde when compared with placebo, with no effect on total antioxidant capacity ( 107888 ). Clinical research in non-menopausal females with episodic migraines without aura shows that taking oral alpha lipoic acid 300 mg twice daily before lunch and dinner for 3 months reduces levels of serum malondialdehyde, but does not affect total antioxidant capacity, glutathione, total antioxidant status, or oxidative stress index, when compared with placebo ( 107889 ). Antiplatelet activity Clinical research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid inhibits platelet aggregation in adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy after 12 weeks ( 115872 ). Antiviral effects Preliminary data suggests that alpha-lipoic acid can inhibit replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by inhibiting reverse transcriptase ( 1280 , 3871 ). Reactive oxygen species may act as intracellular messengers for HIV gene expression and transcription, and the antioxidant effects of alpha-lipoic acid could inhibit this process ( 1562 , 1563 ). Alpha-lipoic acid supplementation might improve blood antioxidant status and blood peroxidation products, and increase T-helper lymphocytes and T-helper to T-helper suppressor cell ratio, based on a small open trial in HIV positive patients ( 3885 ). In vitro, lipoic acid reduced the growth of Vaccinia virus by inhibiting the expression of late genes ( 30862 ). Cardiovascular effects Preliminary evidence suggests that the alpha-lipoic acid metabolite, DHLA, in combination with vitamin E might prevent oxidative stress in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury ( 3871 , 3877 ). In addition, alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and possibly triglycerides ( 100709 , 104650 , 115744 ). Also, ex vivo research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid decreases platelet reactivity in patients with type 1 diabetes, which may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease in these patients ( 30912 ). However, in patients with beta-thalassemia, taking alpha-lipoic acid 600 mg daily does not seem to modify most of the cardiovascular risk factors measured, including homocysteine and trimethylamine-N-oxide. The effects on plasma lipids in this group of patients is not known ( 103329 ). Chelating effects Alpha-lipoic acid and DHLA have been shown to chelate heavy metals ( 30843 ). In animal research, alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to increase the hepatobiliary excretion of an organic mercury by forming a stable complex ( 30819 ). Endocrine effects In human research, alpha-lipoic acid improved steady state plasma insulin, glucose infusion rate, and insulin sensitivity ( 3545 , 3876 , 21657 , 30840 , 30863 , 30941 , 104660 ). In animal research, alpha-lipoic acid restored endoneurial glucose storage ( 3878 ), appeared to prevent diabetic endothelial damage, and reduced albuminuria due to its antioxidative properties ( 30791 , 30796 , 30935 ). In additional animal research, alpha-lipoic acid improved muscle regeneration and aided in the redistribution of muscle fibers by stimulating glycolysis through the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, which is impaired in diabetes ( 96230 ). In laboratory research, alpha-lipoic acid increased the overall glucose uptake by stimulating glucose transport via the insulin signaling pathway ( 3544 , 3875 , 3876 , 30793 , 30797 , 30931 , 30933 , 30934 , 30950 , 96230 ). Alpha-lipoic acid contains high-energy bonds and functions as a coenzyme with pyrophosphate in the conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl-coenzyme A (Krebs cycle). As a cofactor in enzyme complexes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-ketoacids, alpha-lipoic acid decreases lactate and pyruvate concentrations, thus improving glucose effectiveness ( 3545 , 3544 ). DHLA also appears to prevent serum albumin glycation in vitro ( 30928 ), as well as hemoglobin glycation and lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes ( 30794 ). Immunologic effects The addition of alpha-lipoic acid to peripheral blood mononuclear cells of cancer patients significantly enhanced progression of the cells through the G0/G1 to S phase, suggesting that alpha-lipoic acid may help restore the immune system in these patients ( 30802 ). Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that alpha-lipoic acid improves functional reactivity of lymphocytes to T-cell mitogens in HIV patients who previously failed antiretroviral treatment (HAART) ( 21655 ). Metabolic effects Case reports indicate that alpha-lipoic acid may be helpful in various inborn errors of metabolism which result in lactic acidosis ( 1554 , 1555 , 1557 ). Neurological effects In some animal research, alpha-lipoic acid scavenged very-long-chain fatty acid-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in reduced oxidative stress to proteins, axonal degeneration, and locomotor impairment ( 30902 ). Other animal research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid prevents nerve dysfunction by attenuating the oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia in diabetic rats ( 30885 ). In experimental diabetic models, alpha-lipoic acid increases neuronal blood flow, improves neuronal glucose uptake, increases amounts of reduced glutathione in neurons, and improves neuronal conduction velocity ( 3873 , 3878 ). Alpha-lipoic acid may be beneficial in neuropathic pain due to decreased nociceptive sensitivity, via inhibition of T-type calcium channels ( 112940 ). Osteoporosis effects In vitro evidence suggests that alpha-lipoic acid suppresses the development of osteoclasts, bone cells that resorb bone tissue, by directly inhibiting RANKL-RANK mediated signals, not by mediating cellular RANKL (kappaB ligand) production ( 30822 ). Other in vitro evidence suggests that alpha-lipoic acid inhibits TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in human bone marrow stromal cells, which may attenuate bone loss ( 30824 ). Vascular effects Clinical research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid can improve flow-mediated dilation ( 21656 , 30715 , 30851 , 30881 , 30884 , 30896 ). Animal research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid can partially restore the decline in endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity that is associated with vascular dysfunction in the elderly ( 30807 ). Other animal research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid improves endothelial dysfunction in obese rats by activating AMP-activated protein kinase in endothelial cells ( 30827 ). In vitro research suggests that alpha-lipoic acid downregulates proteins upregulated by and upregulates certain proteins downregulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in vascular smooth muscle cells ( 30810 ). TNF-alpha is believed to regulate cellular functions associated with the initiation and progression of vascular lesions; by attenuating the effects of TNF-alpha, alpha-lipoic acid may reduce the development of atherosclerosis. Weight loss effects In general, clinical research shows that taking alpha-lipoic acid reduces levels of leptin and increases levels of adiponectin in patients with excess adiposity. A dysregulation in the levels of these adipocytokines in adipose tissue is thought to play a role in the development of chronic disease, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ( 103331 , 104660 ). Additionally, clinical research shows that the application of an alpha-lipoic acid transdermal patch reduces triceps skinfold and subcutaneous fat thickness ( 115874 ). In an animal model, alpha-lipoic acid (0.5% weight/weight) reduces body weight and food intake. Alpha-lipoic acid also increases whole-body energy expenditure. It appears to exert its effects by suppressing hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase ( 30814 ). Wound-healing effects According to human research, the mechanisms of action behind the wound-healing effects of alpha-lipoic acid may include antioxidant effects ( 21677 ), inhibition of expression of genes for metalloproteinases, and increased expression of genes for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-beta, b-FGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, and IL-6 ( 21676 ).",
