  "effectiveness_text": "Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Dyslipidemia. Oral Indian gooseberry seems to be beneficial for dyslipidemia. Meta-analyses of 12 small clinical studies in healthy adults or patients with dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or metabolic syndrome show that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract or powder 0.5-3 grams daily or Indian gooseberry fruit 12 grams daily for 2-12 weeks reduces total cholesterol by around 39 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 15-34 mg/dL, and triglycerides by around 22-52 mg/dL when compared with control groups. Results are conflicting whether Indian gooseberry increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ( 111567 , 111568 ). Subgroup analysis suggests that Indian gooseberry is more effective at doses greater than 1 gram daily and in adults with triglycerides above 150 mg/dL ( 111568 ). Clinical research in patients with dyslipidemia shows that taking Indian gooseberry whole fruit extract (Tri-low, Arjuna Natural Ltd.) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 34% and 20%, respectively, compared with 15% and 5%, respectively, in patients taking placebo ( 99238 ). more Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Oral Indian gooseberry seems to be beneficial for reducing symptoms of GERD. Clinical research in adults who have had non-erosive symptoms of GERD for at least 3 months shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract 1000 mg twice daily for 4 weeks reduces the frequency and severity of heartburn and regurgitation by about 63% and 50%, respectively, compared with reductions of 24% and 5%, respectively, in patients taking placebo ( 99240 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Aging skin. Oral Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in healthy, middle-aged females shows that drinking 50 mL of a juice containing Indian gooseberry extract 30-60 mg and lingonberry extract 25-50 mg daily for 12 weeks improves skin elasticity, thickness, wrinkles, and hydration when compared with placebo ( 102856 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to Indian gooseberry, lingonberry, or the combination. Another small clinical study in healthy, middle-aged females shows that applying a topical emulsion containing extracts of Indian gooseberry 3% and gotu kola 3% twice daily for 60 days improves skin hydration, some measures of skin wrinkles, and elasticity of the cheek but not the eye when compared with placebo ( 111571 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to Indian gooseberry, gotu kola, or the combination. more Androgenic alopecia. Topical Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. In individuals with self-perceived hair loss, preliminary clinical research shows that applying a hair product containing Indian gooseberry modestly improves hair growth rate and density, as well as hair thinning, when compared with baseline. Patients used a leave-in product containing Indian gooseberry (Saberry), coconut water solids (Cococin), gamma-L-glutamyl-selenomethionine (Peptiselect), and other ingredients as 3.5 mL in females and 2 mL in males, once daily for 3 months ( 105353 ). more Cancer. Although there is interest in using oral Indian gooseberry for cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Indian gooseberry for this purpose. Cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for the prevention of CVD. A meta-analysis of 9 small clinical studies in adults who are healthy or have CVD risk factors shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract or powder 500-1500 mg daily for 2-12 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by around 15 mg/dL, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol by around 5 mg/dL, triglycerides by around 22 mg/dL, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein when compared with control groups. However, the meta-analysis suggests that Indian gooseberry does not improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, or diastolic blood pressure ( 111567 ). The validity of these findings is limited by small sample sizes and considerable heterogeneity among the included studies. more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. A small clinical trial in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 shows that receiving Indian gooseberry powder 2 grams twice daily for 10 days does not impact RT-PCR positivity rate at day 10 when compared with placebo. Additionally, there were no clear trends in clinical improvement in patients receiving Indian gooseberry when compared with placebo. All patients in this study also received oral hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir ( 110012 ). more Diabetes. Several small or limited-quality clinical studies suggest that oral Indian gooseberry may modestly improve glycemic control and blood lipid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. A moderate-sized, open-label study in adults with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia shows that taking Indian gooseberry extract, standardized to 10% beta-glucogallin, 2 grams daily for 90 days reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, and postprandial blood glucose when compared to baseline, with superior effects on fasting blood glucose and postprandial blood glucose when compared with metformin 500 mg ( 111569 ). A smaller clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes on stable doses of metformin shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract (Capros, Natreon Inc) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces HbA1c by around 0.5% and improves low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels when compared with placebo. Taking a lower dose, 250 mg twice daily, does not seem to improve HbA1c but has a modest effect on lipid levels ( 105356 ). Another small clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes using various antidiabetes drugs shows that taking powdered Indian gooseberry fruit 1 gram, 2 grams, or 3 grams daily for 3 weeks modestly reduces fasting and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose levels and improves lipid levels when compared to baseline ( 105355 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Hangover. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for hangover prevention. A small clinical trial shows that taking Indian gooseberry leaf extract (Phyllpro) 750 mg daily for 10 days prior to alcohol intoxication modestly reduces some hangover symptoms 10 hours later, including nausea, headache, lack of appetite, and dizziness, when compared with placebo. Blood alcohol levels after 12 hours were also reduced. However, the overall hangover score was not significantly different between groups ( 99846 ). more Hepatitis B. Although there is interest in using oral Indian gooseberry for hepatitis B, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of Indian gooseberry for this condition. Hypercholesterolemia. Small studies suggest that oral Indian gooseberry might help to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry might reduce levels of LDL cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia. One preliminary clinical study shows that taking Indian gooseberry 50 grams for 4 weeks decreases LDL cholesterol by 15% when compared to baseline ( 2077 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract (Amlamax, Arjuna Natural Ltd.) 500 mg or 1000 mg daily for 6 months reduces levels of LDL cholesterol by about 13% when compared with baseline ( 99241 ). Also, one small study shows that taking an Indian gooseberry fruit juice powder 500 mg daily for 6 weeks modestly decreases LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels when compared with baseline ( 99242 ). Some preliminary clinical research also shows that Indian gooseberry reduces LDL cholesterol in obese individuals. One small study shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract (Capros, Natreon Inc.) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces LDL cholesterol by 16 mg/dL in this population when compared to baseline ( 92515 ). However, the validity of these studies is limited by the lack of comparator groups. more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for hypertension. In patients with uncontrolled hypertension using standard therapies, clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry dried fruit powder 500 mg three times daily for 8 weeks reduces systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 16% and 12%, respectively, from baseline, which is significantly greater than reductions seen with placebo. The frequency of response to treatment, based on a reduction in SBP or DBP of at least 10 mmHg or 5 mmHg, respectively, was also increased from up to 50% to at least 83% of patients ( 105352 ). However, other clinical research in adults with cardiovascular risk factors shows that taking Indian gooseberry 500-1500 mg twice daily for 2-12 weeks does not reduce SBP or DBP more than placebo ( 105354 , 111567 ). more Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small, open-label study of adults with IBS shows that taking 7 grams of an Unani medicinal product called Jawarish Shahi, containing Indian gooseberry, terminalia, coriander, cardamom, and willow bark, twice daily for 45 days reduces the severity of IBS, as measured by improvements in abdominal pain and distension, bowel habits, and quality of life, when compared to baseline ( 111570 ). The validity of these findings is limited by insufficient blinding and the lack of a comparator group. It is unclear if these effects are due to Indian gooseberry, other ingredients, or the combination. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for metabolic syndrome. Preliminary clinical research in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a specific Indian gooseberry extract (Capros, Natreon Inc.) 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces total cholesterol by nearly 10%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 15%, and triglycerides by 10%, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by about 7% when compared with placebo. Additionally, taking this product as 500 mg twice daily reduces total cholesterol by 14%, LDL cholesterol by 26%, and triglycerides by 19%, and increases HDL cholesterol by 22% when compared with placebo. Both doses also seem to improve markers of endothelial function, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation ( 102857 ). more Obesity. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial for improving weight loss or metabolic parameters in adults with obesity. Preliminary clinical research in overweight or obese individuals shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit extract (Capros, Natreon Inc.) 500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 16 mg/dL when compared to baseline. However, there was no effect on other lipids or on blood pressure, body weight, or body mass index ( 92515 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Oral mucositis. It is unclear if oral Indian gooseberry is beneficial in patients with radiation-induced mucositis. A retrospective observational study in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy suggests that rinsing the mouth with Indian gooseberry 1% and povidone-iodine twice daily is associated with delayed development of mucositis and intolerable mucositis and a decreased incidence of intolerable mucositis when compared with povidone-iodine alone ( 111566 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the retrospective study design. more Osteoarthritis. Oral Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in adults with knee osteoarthritis suggests that specific Ayurvedic formulas containing Indian gooseberry may be equivalent to glucosamine sulfate 2 grams daily or celecoxib 200 mg daily for reducing pain. Two capsules containing Indian gooseberry 166.66 mg/capsule, ginger 33.33 mg/capsule, and Tinospora cordifolia 73.33 mg/capsule, with or without Boswellia serrata 100 mg/capsule, taken three times daily for 24 weeks, were used. All four treatments reduced active pain by about 28% to 38%, functional pain by 19% to 29%, and functional difficulty by 18% to 25%, with no significant between-group differences in the observed improvements ( 89557 ). It is not clear if these effects are due to Indian gooseberry, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Periodontitis. It is unclear if subgingival Indian gooseberry is beneficial for periodontitis. Clinical research in patients with chronic periodontitis shows that the subgingival application of a sustained-release Indian gooseberry fruit 10% gel following scaling and root planing does not affect plaque or gingivitis development over 2-3 months when compared with placebo. However, there was a modest benefit on periodontal destruction based on probing pocket depth ( 105358 ). more Vitiligo. Oral Indian gooseberry has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in patients with vitiligo shows that taking 1 tablet containing Indian gooseberry 100 mg, vitamin E 10 mg, and carotenoids 4.7 mg orally 3 times daily for 6 months, in combination with conventional topical therapy and/or phototherapy, increases re-pigmentation in the head, neck, and trunk and decreases signs of inflammation when compared with conventional treatment alone ( 92513 ). more More evidence is needed to rate Indian gooseberry for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Likely Safe when consumed in amounts commonly found in foods ( 6 , 2076 ). Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts. Indian gooseberry fruit extract has been used safely in doses of up to 1000 mg daily for up to 6 months, 1500 mg daily for up to 8 weeks, or 2000 mg daily for up to 4 weeks ( 92515 , 99238 , 99240 , 99241 , 102855 , 102857 , 105352 , 105354 , 105356 ). Indian gooseberry leaf extract has been used with apparent safety at a dose of 750 mg daily for 10 days ( 99846 ). ...when used topically and appropriately. An emulsion containing Indian gooseberry extract 3% and other ingredients has been applied safely to the skin twice daily for up to 60 days ( 111571 ). PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: Indian gooseberry has most often been used as a fruit extract in doses of 500-1000 mg daily for 4-12 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Topical: Indian gooseberry has been applied as a subgingival gel or a hair product. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization & Formulation In one clinical trial, a specific formulation (Tri-low, Arjuna Natural Ltd.) of Indian gooseberry was prepared as the extract of the whole fruit, including the seeds. The extract was standardized to contain at least 35% polyphenols, 8% triterpenoids, and 10% oil ( 99238 ). Other extracts used in clinical trials have been prepared from the de-seeded fruit ( 92515 , 99240 , 99241 ). One such product (Capros) was standardized to contain about 60% low-molecular-weight hydrolysable tannins such as emblicanin-A, emblicanin-B, punigluconin, and pedunculagin ( 92515 , 105356 ). In one clinical trial, a topical product contained Indian gooseberry extract (Saberry) standardized to 10% beta-glucogallin ( 105353 ). In one trial, a leaf extract (Phyllpro) was standardized to contain not less than 0.1% hypophyllanthin and 0.4% phyllanthin by weight ( 99846 ).",

Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, Indian gooseberry may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs; however, research is conflicting. Clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry 500 mg as a single dose or twice daily for 10 days reduces platelet aggregation by about 24% to 36%, increases bleeding time by about 3.8-5.9 seconds, and increases clotting time by about 9.8-12.7 seconds when compared to baseline. However, taking Indian gooseberry 500 mg along with clopidogrel 75 mg or ecosprin 75 mg, as a single dose or for 10 days, does not significantly reduce platelet aggregation or increase bleeding time or clotting time when compared with clopidogrel 75 mg or ecosprin 75 mg alone ( 92514 ). Until more is known, use caution when taking Indian gooseberry in combination with anticoagulant/antiplatelet drugs. more ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Taking Indian gooseberry with antidiabetes drugs might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry fruit or fruit extract alone or in conjunction with antidiabetes medications can lower blood glucose levels ( 31025 , 105355 , 105356 , 111569 ). Dose adjustments to diabetes medications might be necessary. more ASPIRIN Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, Indian gooseberry may increase the risk of bleeding if used with aspirin; however, research is conflicting. Clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry 500 mg as a single dose or twice daily for 10 days reduces platelet aggregation by about 24% to 36%, increases bleeding time by about 3.8-5.9 seconds, and increases clotting time by about 9.8-12.7 seconds when compared to baseline. However, taking a single dose of Indian gooseberry 500 mg along with ecosprin 75 mg, or taking a combination of Indian gooseberry 500 mg twice daily plus ecosprin 75 mg once daily for 10 days, does not significantly reduce platelet aggregation or increase bleeding time or clotting time when compared with ecosprin 75 mg alone ( 92514 ). more CLOPIDOGREL (Plavix) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination.

  "mechanism_text": "Anti-inflammatory effects Indian gooseberry leaf extract might have anti-inflammatory activity ( 2078 , 2079 ). In humans, Indian gooseberry extract reduces levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) ( 92515 , 99241 , 102857 , 105356 ) and increases levels of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-10 ( 99846 ). Anticancer effects Indian gooseberry decreased tumor size and increased survival in tumor-bearing mice ( 31021 ). The juice of Indian gooseberry inhibits the formation of the genotoxic compounds N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and N-nitrosoproline (NPRO) in humans and animals ( 2080 ). Antioxidant effects In rats, the tannins emblicanin A, emblicanin B, punigluconin, and pedunculagin found in Indian gooseberry increased concentrations of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase within the brain ( 2081 ). Cardiovascular effects Clinical research shows that taking Indian gooseberry extract 250-500 mg twice daily orally for 12 weeks reduces levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), which is a marker of coronary heart disease ( 92515 , 102857 , 105356 ). Preliminary evidence also shows that Indian gooseberry fruit, juice, or extract may lower total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids, improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and have positive effects on atherosclerosis and endothelial function ( 2077 , 8180 , 102855 , 102857 , 105356 ). Animal studies suggest that Indian gooseberry may prevent age-related hyperlipidemia by reducing nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels via inhibiting NF-kappaB activation ( 31046 ). Coagulation effects Clinical research shows that Indian gooseberry extract can inhibit adenosine diphosphate (ADP)- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation ( 92514 , 92515 ). Indian gooseberry extract also inhibited platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 production in animals ( 2079 ). Constituents The applicable part of Indian gooseberry is primarily the fruit ( 2075 ), but extracts from the leaves and bark have also been used ( 2078 , 2079 , 99242 ). The vitamin C content of Indian gooseberry fruit has been assayed at approximately 1 gram per 100 mL of fresh fruit juice ( 31016 ). The fruit also contains gallic acid, flavonoids, and tannins such as emblicanin-A, emblicanin-B, punigluconin, and pedunculagin ( 92515 , 99240 ). Dental effects In humans, chewing gum containing Indian gooseberry fruit extract increased saliva flow and reduced levels of pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis ( 99239 ). Endocrine effects In animal studies and in vitro, Indian gooseberry reduces the release of inflammatory cytokines that cause insulin resistance ( 31025 ). Gastroprotective effects Alcoholic and aqueous extracts of Indian gooseberry show protective and healing effects in alcohol-induced gastric ulcers in animal experiments ( 31026 , 31036 ). Immunomodulatory effects Indian gooseberry extract inhibits leukotriene B4-induced migration, leukotriene B4 release, and degranulation of human polymorphonuclear lymphocytes in vitro ( 2078 , 2079 ).",
