  "effectiveness_text": "Expand All | Collapse All Likely Effective Biotin deficiency. Oral and injectable biotin prevents and treats biotin deficiency. Biotin up to 10 mg daily has been used to treat and prevent biotin deficiency. Injections of biotin 150 mcg daily for 3-5 days have been used in adults. Biotin deficiency might occur due to different etiologies such as inherited biotinidase deficiency, malnutrition, chronic use of anticonvulsants, pregnancy, and excessive and chronic raw egg consumption ( 6243 , 19347 ). A very small study in newborns aged 1-6 months shows that adding biotin to infant formula safely improves biotin status in formula-fed infants ( 111365 ). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of blinding, no randomization, and the small sample size. more Possibly Ineffective Multiple sclerosis (MS). In spite of contrary reports, high-dose biotin (300 mg daily) does not reduce disability in patients with progressive MS. It also does not seem to be linked to an increased risk for relapse. Although most earlier research suggested benefit, the highest quality evidence shows that high-dose biotin does not improve outcomes in progressive MS ( 95662 , 102963 , 102966 , 104011 ). A large multi-centered randomized clinical trial (SPI2) in patients with progressive MS and high disability shows that taking biotin 100 mg three times daily for 15 months does not improve disability, as measured on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), or 25-foot walking time, when compared with placebo. The SPI2 clinical trial also did not find that biotin increases the rate of relapse ( 104011 ), a concern raised in one observational study of high-dose biotin ( 104000 ). Also, a large observational study of adults with progressive MS failed to identity an increase in annualized relapse rates in patients that reported taking biotin when compared with controls ( 105716 ). Other observational research has also found no effect on the relapse risk ( 102963 , 102964 ). There is some speculation that any increased rate of relapse identified in some high-dose biotin cohorts might be due to detection bias or reduced compliance with disease-modifying therapies. more Seborrheic dermatitis. Oral biotin doesn't seem to improve seborrheic dermatitis of infancy. A clinical trial in infants with seborrheic dermatitis shows that biotin given by mouth does not improve symptoms when compared with placebo ( 8469 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Alopecia areata. It is unclear if oral biotin is beneficial for alopecia areata. A small clinical study in healthy adults with alopecia areata shows that weekly injections of intramuscular biotin 5 mg/1 mL and dexpanthenol 250 mg/2 mL for 6 weeks reduces hair fall count and transiently increases hair density compared with baseline ( 111366 ). The validity of these findings is limited by a lack of a placebo control group, small sample size, and short duration of treatment. It is unclear if the effects are due to biotin, dexpanthenol, or the combination. Another small clinical study in 9-year-old children with alopecia areata shows that taking biotin 20 mg with zinc aspartate 100 mg orally along with topical application of clobetasol propionate 0.025% daily for one year promotes hair regrowth in 33% of children, compared with 0% in the group receiving the steroid deflazacort ( 6932 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to biotin, zinc, topical clobetasol, or the combination. more Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). Although there is interest in using oral biotin for ALS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of biotin for this condition. Biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease. Adding oral biotin to oral thiamine does not seem to improve most symptoms associated with this condition, although it may slightly speed recovery from acute crisis in children. A small case series in children ages 1-12 years with biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease has found that adding biotin 5 mg/kg daily to thiamine 40 mg/kg daily for 30 months is not associated with additional symptomatic improvement in encephalopathy, seizures, dystonia, or other neurologic sequelae when compared with taking only thiamine. However, taking biotin with thiamine is associated with a 1-day reduction in recovery from acute crisis when compared with thiamine alone ( 95661 ). more Brittle nails. Low quality studies suggest that oral biotin might improve nail thickness and prevent the splitting of brittle nails. Some small, low quality clinical studies in people with brittle nails shows that taking biotin 2.5 mg orally daily for 1.5 to 15 months increases nail thickness and decreases the splitting of fingernails and toenails in some people when compared with baseline ( 171 , 35593 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the small study sizes and the lack of a comparator group. Biotin has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small retrospective observational study in adults with brittle nails suggests that taking oral biotin 1 mg combined with vitamin B6 100 mg daily for 3 months leads to a complete response rate (>90% improvement) in 70% of participants compared with 10% and 11% with biotin and vitamin B6 alone, respectively, at 6-9 months post-treatment. The validity of these findings is limited by the poor methodology, including lack of blinding and lack of a control group ( 116681 ). more Depression. Although there is interest in using oral biotin for mild depression, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of biotin for this condition. Diabetes. It is unclear if oral biotin is beneficial for type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials shows that taking biotin 1.5-15 mg orally daily for 1-3 months does not improve fasting blood glucose or serum insulin levels when compared with placebo. However, the validity of these results is limited by inclusion of subjects with and without diabetes ( 110044 ). A very small study in adults with type 2 diabetes also shows that taking biotin 5 mg three times daily for 28 days does not affect glucose or insulin levels when compared to baseline ( 11579 ). Biotin has also been studied in combination with other ingredients. Preliminary clinical research shows that a taking a specific supplement containing a combination of biotin 2 mg and chromium picolinate 600 mcg (Diachrome, Nutrition 21) can lower blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes who are poorly controlled on oral hypoglycemic drugs ( 12385 , 12390 , 15169 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to biotin, chromium, or the combination. more Diabetic neuropathy. Although there is interest in using oral and intramuscular biotin for diabetic neuropathy, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of biotin for this condition. Muscle cramps. It is unclear if biotin is beneficial for improving muscle cramps in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Patients undergoing hemodialysis are prone to muscle cramps. A small clinical study in patients with hemodialysis-related muscle cramps shows that taking biotin 1 mg in the morning daily for at least one week prevents and reduces severity of muscle cramps when compared to baseline. Cessation of biotin led to recurrence of cramps, and restarting oral biotin led to resolution of cramps during hemodialysis ( 89475 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of comparator group. more More evidence is needed to rate biotin for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Biotin has been safely used in doses up to 300 mg daily for up to 6 months. A tolerable upper intake level (UL) has not been established ( 1900 , 6243 , 95662 , 102965 ). ...when applied topically as cosmetic products at concentrations of 0.0001% to 0.6% biotin ( 19344 ). Possibly Safe when used intramuscularly and appropriately ( 8468 , 111366 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Biotin has been safely used at adequate intake doses of 5-25 mcg daily for up to 6 months ( 173 , 6243 , 19347 , 19348 , 111365 ). A tolerable upper intake level (UL) has not been established. PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Biotin has been safely used at the adequate intake (AI) dose of 30 mcg daily during pregnancy and 35 mcg daily during lactation. It has also been used in supplemental doses of up to 300 mcg daily ( 6243 , 7878 ). A tolerable upper intake level (UL) has not been established.",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: There is no recommended dietary allowance (RDA) established for biotin. The adequate intake (AI) for adults over 18 years and during pregnancy is 30 mcg daily. The AI during lactation is 35 mcg daily ( 6243 ). Biotin is most commonly used in doses up to 2.5 mg daily for up to 15 months ( 171 , 35593 ). It has also been used in doses up to 300 mg daily for up to 6 months ( 102965 ). Lab test interactions are more likely to occur with the use of these higher doses. Avidin, a protein in raw egg whites, binds to biotin in the intestine and prevents biotin absorption ( 6243 , 19352 , 19355 ). Eating 2 or more uncooked egg whites daily for several months might cause biotin deficiency ( 2677 , 6243 , 11593 , 19353 , 19354 ). Topical: Biotin, in concentrations ranging from 0.0001% to 0.6%, is included in some commercial cosmetic products ( 19344 ). Children Oral: There is no recommended dietary allowance (RDA) established for biotin. The daily adequate intakes (AI) for biotin are 7 mcg for infants 0-12 months, 8 mcg for children 1-3 years, 12 mcg for children 4-8 years, 20 mcg for children 9-13 years, and 25 mcg for adolescents 14-18 years ( 6243 ). Standardization & Formulation There is insufficient reliable information available about the standardization of biotin.",
  "interactions_text": "None known.",
  "mechanism_text": "General Biotin is a vitamin that is found in small amounts in numerous foods. In food, biotin is protein bound and is cleaved by the enzyme biotinidase ( 35526 ). Biotin is also synthesized in animals by intestinal microflora. Researchers think biotin is stored in the mitochondria, and that it acts as a coenzyme in bicarbonate-dependent carboxylation reactions ( 6243 ). Biotin-containing enzymes are involved in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, propionate metabolism, and the catabolism of leucine in mammals ( 173 , 19353 ). Pyruvate decarboxylase, a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, is a biotin-dependent enzyme ( 35616 ). Decreased activity of this enzyme during biotin deficiency may result in accumulation of pyruvate or decreased aspartate concentration ( 8468 ). Biotin deficiency is difficult to detect because of the lack of assay techniques to determine biotin concentrations in blood ( 8501 ). Symptoms of deficiency include thinning of the hair, frequently with loss of hair color, and red scaly rash around the eyes, nose, and mouth. Neurological symptoms, including depression, lethargy, hallucinations, and paresthesias of the extremities, are also common in biotin deficiency ( 6243 , 35583 , 35600 , 35606 , 35611 ). Biotin deficiency is most likely to occur in people with congenital biotinidase deficiency, malabsorption syndromes, such as short-gut syndrome, during pregnancy, and in people receiving long-term parenteral nutrition ( 6243 , 7878 , 8501 ). There is some evidence that diabetes may produce a biotin-deficient state ( 8468 ). Antidiabetes effects Blood glucose concentrations decrease as plasma and tissue concentrations of biotin increase in people with and without diabetes, but this effect is more dramatic in people with diabetes ( 7880 ). Animal research suggests that biotin reduces blood glucose levels by stimulating the expression of proteins/enzymes that favor hypoglycemia such as insulin, pancreatic glucokinase, and hepatic glucokinase, as well as inhibiting the expression of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (an enzyme that stimulates glucose production) ( 35529 , 35557 ). Carcinogenic effects Laboratory research suggests that biotin might have some mutagenic effects, however this has not been seen in animals or humans. In vitro, biotin induced the expression and activity of cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) in human T lymphocyte (Jurkat) cells, which increased breaks of single-stranded DNA ( 19350 ). Developmental effects Dietary biotin deficiency has been associated with congenital malformations or teratogenicity in animal research ( 35556 ). Laboratory evidence suggests that biotin may be involved in mesenchyme proliferation ( 35556 ). Fertility effects Biotin deficiency has reportedly been associated with delayed spermatogenesis and decreased number of spermatozoa ( 35556 ). Animal research suggests that biotin deficiency is associated with decreased testicular and serum levels of testosterone. Treatment with biotin or biotin in combination with testosterone appears to normalize spermatogenesis in these animals. It is postulated that biotin may be involved in the formation of local testicular factor(s) involved in Leydig, Sertoli, and peritubular cell interactions that occur during spermatogenesis ( 35556 ). Growth effects Biotin appears to improve brittle nails by inducing epidermal differentiation ( 35569 ). Preliminary, low-quality, clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking biotin 2.5 mg by mouth daily for 4 weeks increases nail growth rate by 13% when compared with baseline. Applying minoxidil 5% topical spray twice daily increases nail growth rate more than biotin, but concomitant use of both biotin and minoxidil does not seem to provide further benefit. The validity of these findings is limited by non-randomized treatment allocation ( 105717 ). Hair growth effects In young, healthy males with normal hair growth, taking biotin 5 mg daily orally in combination with minoxidil 5% applied topically for 14 days increases the mean hair growth rate by about 0.3 mm per week when compared to baseline. Using either treatment alone does not increase the hair growth rate. Biotin may act as a cofactor in the hair growth cycle ( 114724 ). Immunomodulating effects Most evidence suggests that biotin deficiency has negative effects on immune function. Cases of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) not associated with adenosine deaminase deficiency have been associated with biotin-dependent carboxylase deficiency ( 35601 ). Also, biotin deficiency has been associated with thymic atrophy, decreased proliferation of spleen cells, reduced antibody synthesis, and delayed rejection of skin allographs ( 35607 ). However, the effects of biotin supplementation on immune function are less consistent. In biotin-deficient animals, treatment with biotin supplements seems to restore immune function ( 35607 ). However, biotin supplementation appears to reduce the activity of interleukins and interferons and decrease the number of lymphocytes when administered to healthy adults ( 7879 ). Lipid-lowering effects Some evidence from animal research suggests that biotin may affect lipid metabolism by decreasing the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC 2), an enzyme that regulates fatty acid oxidation ( 35557 ). Decreasing the activity of ACC 2 appears to increase fatty acid oxidation by decreasing levels of malonyl-CoA. Neurological effects In studies of animals that were not biotin deficient, biotin modulated gene expression in animals and altered astrocyte glucose utilization ( 35546 ). It is postulated that high doses of biotin could improve symptoms of multiple sclerosis by activating the Krebs cycle in demyelinated nerve cells and activating fatty acid synthesis required for myelin synthesis ( 95662 ).",
