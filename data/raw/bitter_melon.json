Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for amenorrhea, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Athletic performance. It is unclear if oral bitter melon is beneficial for improving athletic performance. Preliminary clinical research in ten male tennis players taking part in high-intensity training at high temperatures shows that taking bitter melon extract orally, 100 mL six times daily for 4 weeks, improves some biomarkers of fatigue and physical fitness parameters including balance, flexibility, and cardiorespiratory fitness when compared with baseline. Levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone and cortisol are decreased, suggesting a reduction in oxidative stress ( 103295 , 106407 ). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Constipation. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for constipation, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this purpose. Diabetes. Although some research suggests that bitter melon may improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes, evidence is conflicting and of limited quality. A meta-analysis of 10 low-quality studies in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking bitter melon powdered whole fruits or juice in doses of 0.5 to 12 grams daily for 4-16 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose (FBG) by 13 mg/dL, postprandial glucose by 26 mg/dL, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.26% when compared with placebo ( 100632 ). Another meta-analysis, pooling the results of 7 trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, shows that bitter melon modestly reduces HbA1c by 0.3% and FBG by 14 mg/dL when compared with no treatment, but a separate analysis of 2 other trials shows that bitter melon does not improve either outcome when compared with oral antidiabetic drugs ( 111503 ). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 3 clinical trials shows that taking bitter melon 1-6 grams daily for 4-12 weeks does not significantly improve fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c when compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 92124 ). Some other clinical research in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that bitter melon fruit, fruit pulp, fruit juice, and extract improve glucose tolerance and insulin secretion, reduce blood glucose levels, and lower HbA1c ( 34 , 35 , 36 , 38 , 12530 ). One clinical study shows that taking powdered bitter melon fruit 2-4 grams daily for 10 weeks lowers HbA1c similarly to glyburide 2.5 mg daily ( 92126 ). Reasons for the discrepancies among the evidence are not clear but may relate to the small study sizes, shorter durations of treatment, and varying dosages and formulations of bitter melon. more Dyspepsia. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for dyspepsia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this purpose. Genital herpes. Although there is interest in using topical bitter melon for genital herpes, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. HIV/AIDS. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for HIV/AIDS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral bitter melon is beneficial in patients with prediabetes. A small clinical study in patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that drinking a beverage containing bitter melon extract 1.25-3 grams as a single dose does not affect blood glucose or insulin response when compared with baseline ( 97508 ). A moderate-sized clinical study in adults with prediabetes shows that taking bitter melon (SugarKatcherS52, Kolmar BNH) 800 mg three times daily for 12 weeks reduces blood glucose by 22 mg/dL two hours after oral glucose tolerance test when compared with placebo, but does not improve insulin, C-peptide, or glucagon levels, nor markers of insulin resistance ( 112372 ). The validity of these results is limited by the lack of statistical adjustment for multiple comparisons which can lead studies to erroneously show differences between treatment groups (i.e., false positive findings). more Intestinal parasite infection. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for intestinal parasite infection, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for kidney stones, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Liver disease. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for liver disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Metabolic syndrome. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for metabolic syndrome, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Obesity. It is unclear if oral bitter melon is beneficial for weight loss. A very small clinical study in patients with obesity shows that taking bitter melon 1 gram twice daily for 12 weeks does not reduce body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, or body fat percentage when compared to baseline. However, when compared with placebo, body weight and BMI were reduced by around 4 kg and 1.6 kg/m 2 , respectively. Patients in the placebo group experienced an increase in these measures ( 109583 ). more Osteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral bitter melon is beneficial in patients with osteoarthritis. A small preliminary clinical study in patients with osteoarthritis shows that taking bitter melon 1500 mg three times daily for 3 months reduces the need for rescue analgesic medications when compared with placebo. However, subjective scores of osteoarthritis symptoms improved similarly in both groups ( 100631 ). more Peptic ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for PCOS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Psoriasis. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for psoriasis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Ulcerative colitis. Although there is interest in using oral bitter melon for ulcerative colitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this condition. Wound healing. Although there is interest in using topical bitter melon for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of bitter melon for this purpose. More evidence is needed to rate bitter melon for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Possibly Safe when the fruit is used orally and appropriately, short-term. Powdered bitter melon fruit 0.5-12 grams daily for up to 4 months has been used ( 92126 , 100631 , 100632 , 109583 ). Extracts of bitter melon fruit have also been used safely for up to 3 months ( 36 , 15566 , 106408 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about long-term use of bitter melon or the safety of bitter melon when used topically. PREGNANCY: Possibly Unsafe when used orally. Animal research shows that two proteins isolated from the raw fruit of bitter melon possess abortifacient properties ( 3724 , 35719 , 35722 , 35728 ). Also, one animal study shows that bitter melon juice significantly reduces the fertility rate of mice ( 35728 ). However, these effects of bitter melon have not been assessed in humans. LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using.",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: Bitter melon fruit has been used in doses of 0.5-12 grams daily for up to 16 weeks. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization & Formulation Formulations of bitter melon used in clinical research include bitter melon fruit, fruit pulp, fruit juice, and fruit extract ( 34 , 35 , 36 , 38 , 12530 , 92126 ). One clinical trial used a commercially available bitter melon extract (Charantia, Herbcare Corporation) ( 15566 ).",
  "interactions_text": "Expand All | Collapse All ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Taking bitter melon with antidiabetes drugs might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Bitter melon can lower blood glucose levels and might have additive effects when used with antidiabetes drugs ( 34 , 35 , 36 , 38 , 8181 , 12530 , 92124 , 92126 , 92129 , 100632 , 111503 ). This might increase the risk of hypoglycemia in some patients. Monitor blood glucose levels closely. more P-GLYCOPROTEIN SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, bitter melon might increase levels of P-glycoprotein substrates. Bitter melon might inhibit the p-glycoprotein (P-gp) intestinal pump and increase intracellular levels of P-gp substrates. In vitro research in intestinal cells shows that 1-monopalmitin, a constituent of bitter melon, increases levels of daunomycin, a P-gp substrate ( 97509 ). Additionally, drinking bitter melon juice has been associated with a case of acute pancreatitis in a patient who had been taking pazopanib, a P-gp substrate, for 8 years. Researchers theorize that inhibition of P-gp led to increased levels of pazopanib, resulting in pazopanib-induced pancreatitis ( 109581 ). more PAZOPANIB (Votrient) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, bitter melon might increase levels of pazopanib, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects. In one case, a 65-year-old patient taking pazopanib for 8 years for renal cell carcinoma experienced signs and symptoms consistent with acute pancreatitis 4 days after drinking bitter melon juice at a dose of 100-150 mL daily. The patient's symptoms, amylase levels, and lipase levels improved upon discontinuation of bitter melon and pazopanib. Pazopanib treatment was re-initiated with no further evidence of pancreatitis. Researchers theorize that inhibition of P-glycoprotein by bitter melon led to increased levels of pazopanib, a P-glycoprotein substrate, resulting in pazopanib-induced pancreatitis ( 109581 ). more",
  "mechanism_text": "General The applicable parts of bitter melon are the fruit and seeds, and less commonly the leaves and roots ( 100631 ). Bitter melon contains alkaloids, glycosides, saponins, triterpenes, oils, steroids, sterols, polysaccharides, resins, and proteins ( 92129 , 100630 ). It also contains phenolic and flavonoid compounds, and various vitamins and minerals. The immature fruit provides vitamins A and C, and also contains phosphorus and iron ( 92129 ). It also contains cucurbitane-type triterpene glycosides, including furpyronecucubitane A, goyaglycoside I, charantagenin F, and cucurbitane triterpenoid saponins, including charantagenin E, charantosides D and E, karaviloside III, and karavilagenin B ( 100630 ). Bitter melon also contains MAP30, charantin, vicine, insulin-like peptide, alpha- and beta-momorcharin, momordicin, oleanic acids, and 9-cis,11-trans,13-trans-conjugated linolenic acid ( 37 , 38 , 3724 , 7540 , 15566 , 15568 , 35694 , 35695 , 35696 , 35711 , 35714 , 100633 ). Antineoplastic effects Laboratory research shows that bitter melon juice inhibits proliferation and increases necrotic cell death of gemcitabine-resistant human pancreatic adenocarcinoma AsPC-1 cells by targeting PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling, and enhancing autophagy ( 92128 ). This signaling is involved in developing chemoresistance. Bitter melon may also restrict energy and decrease phosphorylation of components that promote chemoresistance and anti-apoptotic effects. Other antineoplastic effects of bitter melon have been attributed to the reduced expression of growth factor receptors such as the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 (also known as neu or c-erb-2), which has been implicated in breast cancer ( 15568 , 35696 ). Bitter melon might also potentiate function of natural killer cells in cancer patients ( 3722 , 35701 ). In addition, 9-cis,11-trans,13-trans-conjugated linolenic acid extracted from bitter melon seed has shown antineoplastic effects in human colon cancer cell lines and in rats ( 35704 , 35711 ). Laboratory research also shows that bitter melon may inhibit RNA synthesis in human leukemic lymphocytes ( 35718 , 35724 ). Additionally, MAP30, a protein isolated from bitter melon extract appears to possess anti-neoplastic effects, possibly due to reduced expression of growth factor receptors ( 7540 , 15568 , 35694 , 35695 , 35696 ). Animal research shows that bitter melon extract reduces head and neck squamous cell carcinoma growth. This occurs via induction of apoptosis and inhibition of both proliferation of tumor cells and c-Myc expression. C-Myc is a protooncogene, and is involved in cancer cell growth and survival, and is overexpressed in various cancers. BME also modulates regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Regulatory T cells suppress anti-tumor immunity ( 92125 ). Antioxidant effects Laboratory research shows that bitter melon extract prevents lipid peroxidation and free radical generation, and scavenges free radicals ( 92129 ). Phenolic compounds present in bitter melon may be responsible for these effects. Antiplatelet effects An in vitro study and stroke model in rats suggests that protein extracts from bitter melon may have inhibitory effects on platelet activation, adhesion, and aggregation in animal tests or when compared with adenosine diphosphate during in vitro tests ( 112373 ). Antiviral effects Laboratory research attributes bitter melon's antiviral activity to a protein called MAP30, which has been isolated from bitter melon seeds and fruit ( 3720 , 3721 , 7540 , 7542 , 35695 ). MAP30 inhibits HIV and herpes simplex viruses, including acyclovir-resistant strains ( 7539 , 7540 ). It appears to inhibit HIV by inhibiting reverse transcriptase. MAP30 is also a N-glucosidase, which inhibits HIV ribosomal protein synthesis and might make viral and plasmid DNA inactive ( 7542 , 7543 ). MAP30 also seems to inhibit HIV integrase, which prevents integration of viral DNA into the genetic material of healthy cells, and causes irreversible relaxation of supercoiled viral nucleic acids ( 7542 , 35694 ). These changes render viruses unable to integrate into host cell genomes. Another protein, MRK29, found in the seed and fruit of a smaller variety of bitter melon found in Thailand, appears to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase and to increase tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity ( 7541 ). Cardiovascular effects In animals, bitter melon may help to decrease high blood pressure through acetylcholine pathways or through reduction of angiotensin converting enzyme ( 92129 ). Fertility effects Animal research shows that two proteins isolated from the raw fruit of bitter melon possess abortifacient properties ( 3724 , 35719 , 35722 ). In one study, the fertility rate of mice fed with daily bitter melon juice dropped from 90% to 20% ( 35728 ). Additionally, spermatogenesis was inhibited in dogs fed a bitter melon fruit extract for 60 days ( 35723 ). Hepatoprotective effects Bitter melon may be hepatoprotective due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects ( 92129 ). In animals, bitter melon appears to improve liver enzymes after carbon tetrachloride or ammonium chloride-induced liver damage, and to increase levels of antioxidants ( 92129 ). In animals, bitter melon may also downregulate factors contributing to development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In vitro studies suggest that karaviloside III and some other compounds in bitter melon inhibit development of hepatic fibrosis and also have activity against liver cancer cell lines ( 100630 ). Hormonal effects Animal research shows that an ethanolic extract of bitter melon seed has antispermatogenic effects and androgenic properties ( 7538 ). Hypoglycemic effects Bitter melon fruit, seed, and leaf extracts have demonstrated hypoglycemic activity in humans and animal models of diabetes ( 34 , 35 , 36 , 3762 , 3763 , 3764 , 3765 , 7700 , 8179 , 15566 , 92124 , 92126 , 92129 ). Preliminary evidence suggests that bitter melon decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis, increases hepatic glycogen synthesis, increases pancreatic insulin secretion, increases peripheral glucose oxidation in erythrocytes and adipocytes, and increases glucose uptake into skeletal muscle ( 12697 , 15568 , 35715 , 35716 , 35717 , 35720 , 92124 , 92126 , 92129 , 106408 ). Bitter melon fruit extract might also protect against hyperinsulinemia ( 7700 ). Bitter melon contains an insulin-like polypeptide called polypeptide P, plant insulin, or p-insulin. P-insulin seems to have pharmacologic effects similar to bovine insulin with an onset of action between 30 and 60 minutes, and a peak effect at about four hours ( 37 , 38 ). Other components of bitter melon reported to have hypoglycemic activity are charantin, which is a mixture of two steroid glycosides, and vicine ( 15566 , 15568 , 92124 ). Bitter melon also seems to increase the muscle content of the insulin-regulated glucose transporter, GLUT4 ( 92126 , 92129 ). Research in animal models shows that an aqueous extract of bitter melon fruit can slow the progression of microalbuminuria and diabetic nephropathy ( 8179 ). Hypolipidemic effects Animal research shows that bitter melon can decrease triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ( 35703 , 35705 , 92129 ). Laboratory research shows that bitter melon decreases accumulation of lipids and inhibits preadipocyte differentiation. It also downregulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), which regulates adipogenesis, as well as decreases other adipogenic factors ( 92129 ). Bitter melon appears to have actions in the pancreas, liver, and fat cells ( 92129 ). It decreases ApoB secretion and alters phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. It also increases components that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and energy demand, leading to increased lipid metabolism and utilization. It also affects levels of mRNA of enzymes that are involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism ( 35706 , 35710 , 92129 ). Flavonoids and saponins may be responsible for these effects ( 8180 , 92129 ). Immunomodulatory effects Constituents of bitter melon called alpha- and beta-momorcharin have immunosuppressive activity in laboratory and animal research. They inhibit mitogenic responses of mouse splenocytes at non-cytotoxic concentrations. They also decrease the functional capacity of macrophages, as well as suppressing the cytotoxic lymphocyte response ( 3724 ). Weight loss effects In animals with diet-induced obesity, bitter melon can reduce body weight by increasing fatty acid oxidation ( 92129 ). Polysaccharides from fermented bitter melon juice decrease body weight in rats fed a high-fat diet, and this is associated with a decrease in the size of fat cells in adipose tissue ( 100629 ). Additionally, bitter melon increases carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-1), an enzyme that transports fatty acids into the mitochondria. It also increases uncoupling proteins and expression of regulators of lipid oxidation, which suggests that bitter melon has an effect on energy expenditure. Also in animals, bitter melon lowers mRNA levels of enzymes required for fatty acid synthesis ( 92129 ).",
