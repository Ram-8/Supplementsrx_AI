Chromium is effective for preventing and treating symptoms of chromium deficiency, including hyperglycemia, glycosuria, sudden weight loss, peripheral neuropathy, and confusion ( 7135 ). more Possibly Effective Diabetes. Oral chromium seems to be modestly beneficial for improving glycemic control in diabetes, especially when used in doses greater than 200 mcg daily and in patients with poorly controlled diabetes. It is unclear if chromium helps to prevent the development of diabetes. Epidemiological research has found that lower toenail chromium levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease ( 11908 ). In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed a qualified health claim stating that chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the FDA has determined that any relationship between chromium picolinate and type 2 diabetes is highly uncertain and is based on limited scientific evidence ( 102362 ). Research on the use of chromium for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is conflicting but seems to show modest benefit in some patients. Several clinical studies, most including fewer than 80 patients with type 2 diabetes, show that taking chromium decreases fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose, insulin, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and increases insulin sensitivity ( 6867 , 7137 , 12390 , 14440 , 15169 , 42628 , 42638 , 95097 , 103745 ). However, other small clinical studies show that chromium is no better than placebo for improving most glycemic indices in patients with diabetes ( 7060 , 14325 , 42679 , 42707 , 90059 , 103746 , 103749 ). Some of these studies may not have been adequately powered and some had a high risk of bias. Furthermore, these studies had high heterogeneity related to study population and size, chromium supplementation duration, formulation, and dose, and accepted standards of diabetes care. Multiple meta-analyses pooling results of these small clinical trials also show mixed results ( 90055 , 90063 , 95098 , 105026 , 110610 , 111420 ). The most recent of the aforementioned meta-analyses show that chromium picolinate lowers HbA1c by about 0.6%, with conflicting findings related to fasting blood glucose and measures of insulin resistance ( 110610 , 111420 ). It is unclear if chromium yeast, chromium dinicocysteinate, or chromium with biotin or other natural ingredients are beneficial. Chromium seems to be most beneficial in doses of greater than 200 mcg taken for 12 weeks or longer, and in patients with poorly controlled diabetes with a baseline HbA1c of 8% or greater ( 90063 , 105026 ). There is also speculation that chromium might primarily benefit patients with low chromium levels; however, there has not been an analysis specifically evaluating this population ( 6867 , 7058 , 13725 , 14325 , 95098 ). Some research suggests that chromium might also modestly improve lipid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 1934 , 6867 , 95098 ). A meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 42-1000 mcg daily for 5-26 weeks decreases triglyceride levels by 7 mg/dL and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 2 mg/dL when compared with control. Taking chromium did not affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, the validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity ( 110605 ). Another meta-analysis failed to demonstrate any effects of chromium on lipid levels ( 110610 ). Research on chromium's effect on blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes is mixed. A meta-analysis of clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 200-1000 mcg daily for 8-25 weeks lowers diastolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg, but does not improve systolic blood pressure or body mass index, when compared with placebo ( 110607 ). Preliminary clinical research shows that chromium picolinate might improve metabolic parameters in patients with other forms of diabetes as well. This includes those with type 1 diabetes ( 1935 ), diabetes secondary to corticosteroid use ( 5039 , 42829 ), and gestational diabetes ( 42817 ). more Possibly Ineffective Hypertension. Meta-analyses of small clinical trials suggest that oral chromium does not lower blood pressure by a clinically meaningful amount. A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in adults with different metabolic disorders shows that taking chromium 42-1000 mcg daily for 12-24 weeks does not lower systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo ( 110609 ). A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials in adults with different chronic disorders shows that taking chromium 42-1000 mcg daily for 4-25 weeks lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 3 mmHg and 1 mmHg, respectively, when compared with placebo. However, the validity of this meta-analysis is limited by high heterogeneity ( 110604 ). Another meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials including patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 200-1000 mcg daily for 8-25 weeks lowers diastolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg, but not systolic blood pressure, when compared with placebo ( 110607 ). In addition, the validity of these results is limited by inclusion of patients with and without hypertension at baseline ( 110604 , 110607 , 110609 ). more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). Oral chromium does not seem to improve glycemic indices in patients with prediabetes. Some clinical research shows that adults with impaired glucose tolerance do not have improved glycemic parameters or insulin sensitivity after taking chromium picolinate 500-1000 mcg daily for up to 6 months when compared with placebo ( 13053 , 42670 ). Likewise, a small clinical study in elderly patients with impaired glucose tolerance shows that chromium supplements do not improve glucose tolerance or triglyceride or cholesterol levels when compared with placebo ( 13722 ). Finally, a preliminary clinical study in overweight or obese adults with prediabetes shows that taking two capsules of a combination product containing chromium, cinnamon, and carnosine (Glycabiane, PiLeJe) daily for 4 months decreases fasting plasma glucose by approximately 4 mg/dL when compared with placebo, but does not improve fasting plasma insulin, measures of insulin sensitivity or resistance, or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) ( 94234 ). The small effect on fasting plasma glucose is clinically insignificant and may be due to the other ingredients in this product. more Schizophrenia. Oral chromium does not seem to improve psychological measures in patients with schizophrenia. Clinical research in patients with schizophrenia shows that taking chromium polynicotinate 400 mcg daily for 3 months does not affect weight or mental status when compared with placebo ( 42613 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Antiretroviral-induced insulin resistance. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial for preventing antiretroviral-induced insulin resistance. Preliminary clinical research in patients with HIV treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) shows that taking chromium nicotinate 200 mcg or chromium picolinate 1000 mcg daily for 8-16 weeks may help decrease insulin resistance and increase glucose disposal when compared to baseline ( 42630 , 42662 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. more Athletic performance. It is unclear if chromium enhances athletic performance, although some research suggests that it may improve body composition when used in conjunction with exercise. One large clinical study shows taking chromium 400 mcg daily, in conjunction with resistance training, can increase weight loss, body fat loss, and lean body mass when compared with placebo in conjunction with resistance training ( 6868 ). However, other, very small clinical studies show that adding chromium picolinate or chromium chloride 177-400 mcg daily to a weight-training program does not improve body composition when compared with weight-training alone ( 6860 , 6861 , 6862 , 42747 ). These studies may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference in outcomes. more Atypical depression. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with atypical depression. Preliminary clinical research in patients with atypical depression shows that taking chromium picolinate 400 mcg daily for 2 weeks followed by 600 mcg daily for an additional 6 weeks improves response and remission rates when compared with placebo ( 10309 ). However, other clinical research shows that taking elemental chromium 400 mcg in the form of chromium picolinate daily for 2 weeks followed by 600 mcg daily for an additional 6 weeks does not improve most symptoms of atypical depression, although appetite and sexual drive may improve, when compared with placebo ( 42600 ). more Beta blocker-induced dyslipidemia. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with dyslipidemia due to beta-blocker use. One small clinical study in patients who take beta-blockers shows that taking glucose tolerance factor (GTF)-chromium 600 mcg daily for 2 months increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by 16%, but does not affect other lipid parameters, when compared with placebo ( 5040 ). more Binge eating disorder. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with binge eating disorder. One small clinical study in adults with overweight and binge eating disorder shows that taking chromium picolinate 600 or 1000 mcg daily for 6 months does not affect binge eating frequency, body weight, or depressive symptoms when compared with placebo ( 90057 ). more Bipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar disorder. Preliminary clinical research in patients with treatment-resistant, rapid-cycling bipolar disorder shows that taking chromium chloride (Hypo-A Chrom, Hypo-A GmbH) 600-800 mcg daily for up to 2 years can decrease the frequency of affective episodes by approximately three episodes annually when compared to baseline ( 42618 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. more Cognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral chromium prevents or treats cognitive impairment. Some clinical research shows that taking chromium picolinate standardized to contain elemental chromium 1000 mcg daily for 12 weeks does not improve memory or depression in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment when compared with placebo. However, results from neuroimaging scans suggest that chromium increases the activity of certain regions of the brain during memory tasks when compared with placebo ( 42666 ). more Hyperlipidemia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral chromium may modestly reduce lipid levels in patients with hyperlipidemia. One small clinical study in patients with atherosclerotic disease shows that taking chromium 250 mcg as chromium chloride daily for 7-16 months decreases triglycerides and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, but not other lipid parameters, when compared with placebo ( 7060 ). Other small clinical studies in adults with hyperlipidemia show that taking chromium picolinate 200 mcg daily for 6 weeks, chromium polynicotinate 200 mcg twice daily, or brewer's yeast containing 48 mcg elemental chromium daily for 6-8 weeks decrease total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared to baseline ( 37178 , 42585 , 42710 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of comparison with a control group. A meta-analysis of small heterogeneous clinical studies in patients mostly without hyperlipidemia shows that taking chromium does not affect lipid levels when compared with placebo ( 105029 ). A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials including patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 42-1000 mcg daily for 5-26 weeks modestly improves triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels, but not LDL cholesterol levels, when compared with control. However, the validity of these results is limited by high heterogeneity and inclusion of patients with and without hyperlipidemia ( 110605 ). In addition, some meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate any effects of chromium on lipid levels in adults with diabetes ( 110610 ). Limited research has tested high-dose chromium in children. One small clinical study in children with hypercholesterolemia shows that taking chromium polynicotinate 400-600 mcg with glucomannan 1000-1500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces total and LDL cholesterol when compared to baseline ( 90061 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to chromium, glucomannan, or the combination. more Hypoglycemia. It is unclear if oral chromium helps to reverse or prevent hypoglycemia. One very small clinical study in patients with reactive hypoglycemia shows that taking chromium chloride 200 mcg daily for 3 months increases blood glucose levels and improves insulin binding and hypoglycemic symptoms following an oral glucose load ( 6859 ). Another small clinical study in patients with symptomatic hypoglycemia shows that taking chromium yeast (Biochrome, Pharma-Nord) 125 mcg daily for 3 months improves symptoms, including chilliness, trembling, and disorientation, when compared with baseline ( 42711 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a control group. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with metabolic syndrome. One small clinical study in patients with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a particular chromium picolinate product (Chromax, Nutrition 21) 500 mcg twice daily for 16 weeks does not affect weight, waist circumference, insulin sensitivity, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), or lipid levels when compared with placebo ( 42654 ). more Myocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if oral chromium helps to prevent MI. Epidemiological research has found that low toenail chromium concentrations are associated with an increased risk of MI ( 13728 ). However, toenail chromium concentrations might not be a reliable predictor of body stores of chromium. There is also no reliable research showing that chromium supplements can prevent MI. more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral chromium slows NAFLD progression. One small clinical study in patients with NAFLD shows that taking chromium picolinate 200 mcg two times daily after meals for 12 weeks does not affect liver enzyme levels or body weight when compared with placebo ( 105027 ). more Obesity. Although some research suggests that oral chromium may increase weight loss, this increase in weight loss is not likely to be considered clinically relevant. Meta-analyses of clinical studies in adults with overweight or obesity show that taking chromium picolinate 200-1000 mcg daily for 12-16 weeks might result in a cumulative weight loss of about 0.5-1 kg when compared with placebo ( 90062 , 90065 ). However, this small reduction in weight is unlikely to be considered clinically significant. Additionally, small clinical studies in healthy adults and children with overweight or obesity show that taking oral chromium 200-1000 mcg daily for 6-24 weeks does not reduce weight when compared with control ( 6860 , 13727 , 17224 , 42680 ). Some of these studies may not have been adequately powered to detect a smaller effect. A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials among adults with type 2 diabetes shows that taking chromium 200-1000 mcg daily for 8-25 weeks does not lower body mass index when compared with placebo. However, the validity of these results is limited by inclusion of patients with and without obesity at baseline ( 110607 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral chromium improves symptoms of PCOS. One small clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking chromium picolinate 1000 mcg daily for 6 months along with diet and exercise counseling decreases body mass index and improves rates of ovulation and regular menstruation when compared with placebo ( 95094 ). Also, some clinical research shows that taking chromium picolinate (21st Century HealthCare, Inc. or Nature Made) 200 mcg daily for 8 weeks increases insulin sensitivity when compared with placebo ( 95095 , 98687 ). However, other preliminary clinical research shows that taking chromium picolinate 200 mcg daily for 4 months does not affect insulin sensitivity or improve ovulation rates ( 42603 ). Although chromium picolinate at doses of less than 1000 mcg might have very small effects on fasting glucose, these doses do not seem to have clinically beneficial effects on fasting glucose, pregnancy rate, or testosterone levels ( 95094 , 95095 , 98687 ). A lower dose of chromium has also been studied in combination with carnitine. One small clinical study in adults with overweight and PCOS shows that taking chromium picolinate 200 mcg daily with carnitine 1000 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance, and body weight, and slightly increases insulin sensitivity, when compared with placebo ( 103747 ). However, it is unclear if this benefit is clinically significant. Additionally, it is unclear if these effects are due to chromium, carnitine, or the combination. Carnitine has demonstrated clinical benefit when used alone in PCOS. more Turner syndrome. It is unclear if oral chromium is beneficial in patients with this condition. A small clinical study shows that taking brewer's yeast 30 grams containing chromium 50 mcg daily for 8 weeks might improve abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism when compared with baseline in patients with Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder that has a high incidence of diabetes ( 13729 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more More evidence is needed to rate chromium for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts, short-term. Chromium has been safely used in doses up to 1000 mcg daily for up to 6 months ( 1934 , 5039 , 5040 , 6858 , 6859 , 6860 , 6861 , 6862 , 6867 , 6868 )( 7135 , 7137 , 10309 , 13053 , 14325 , 14440 , 17224 , 90057 , 90061 )( 90063 , 94234 , 95095 , 95096 , 95097 , 98687 ); however, most of these studies have used chromium doses in a range of 150-600 mcg. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Institute of Medicine (IOM) evaluations of the safety of chromium suggest that it is safe when used in doses of 200 mcg daily for up to 6 months ( 13241 , 13242 ). Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately in medicinal amounts, long-term. Chromium has been safely used in a small number of studies at doses of 200-1000 mcg daily for up to 2 years ( 7060 , 7135 , 42618 , 42628 , 42666 , 110605 , 110607 , 110609 ). However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Institute of Medicine (IOM) evaluations of the safety of chromium suggest that it is safe when used in doses of 200 mcg daily for up to 6 months ( 13241 , 13242 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately in amounts not exceeding the daily adequate intake (AI) levels by age: 0-6 months, 0.2 mcg; 7-12 months, 5.5 mcg; 1-3 years, 11 mcg; 4-8 years, 15 mcg; males 9-13 years, 25 mcg; males 14-18 years, 35 mcg; females 9-13 years, 21 mcg; females 14-18 years, 24 mcg ( 7135 ). POSSIBLY SAFE...when used orally and appropriately in amounts exceeding AI levels. Chromium 400 mcg daily has been used safely for up to 6 weeks ( 42680 ). PREGNANCY: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately in amounts not exceeding adequate intake (AI) levels. The AI for pregnancy is 28 mcg daily for those 14-18 years of age and 30 mcg daily for those 19-50 years of age ( 7135 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Safe when used orally in amounts exceeding the adequate intake (AI) levels. There is some evidence that patients with gestational diabetes can safely use chromium in doses of 4-8 mcg/kg ( 1953 ); however, patients should not take chromium supplements during pregnancy without medical supervision. LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately in amounts not exceeding adequate intake (AI) levels. The AI for lactation is 44 mcg daily for those 14-18 years of age and 45 mcg daily for those 19-50 years of age ( 7135 ). Chromium supplements do not seem to increase normal chromium concentration in human breast milk ( 1937 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of chromium when used in higher amounts while breast-feeding.",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: General : There is insufficient information to establish safe and tolerable upper intake levels for chromium ( 7135 ). However, daily adequate intake (AI) levels for chromium have been established: males 19-50 years, 35 mcg; males 51 and older, 30 mcg; females 19-50 years, 25 mcg; females 51 and older, 20 mcg. During pregnancy: 14-18 years, 29 mcg; 19-50 years, 30 mcg. When lactating: 14-18 years, 44 mcg; 19-50 years, 45 mcg. Sometimes chromium amounts are listed in micromols. The conversion factor to mcg is: 1.92 micromol = 100 mcg ( 6867 ). Chromium has been used in various salt forms and at various doses. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Children Oral: General : There is insufficient information to establish safe and tolerable upper intake levels for chromium ( 7135 ). However, daily adequate intake (AI) levels for chromium have been established by age: 0-6 months, 0.2 mcg; 7-12 months, 5.5 mcg; 1-3 years, 11 mcg; 4-8 years, 15 mcg; males 9-13 years, 25 mcg; females 9-13 years, 21 mcg; males 14-18 years, 35 mcg; females 14-18 years, 24 mcg ( 6867 , 42580 ). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Standardization & Formulation Chromium chloride is the natural form of trivalent chromium ( 95098 ). The most common chromium salt used in supplements is the synthetic chromium picolinate. Other chromium salts used include chromium chloride and chromium polynicotinate ( 2659 , 95098 ). Chromium may also come in the form of brewer's yeast or chromium yeast ( 95098 ). Chromium picolinate is a complex of chromium and picolinic acid, which is a naturally occurring metabolic derivative of tryptophan. It contains 12.4% elemental trivalent chromium ( 2659 , 95094 ). Chromium polynicotinate is often referred to as niacin-bound chromium because it includes chromium bound to molecules of niacin ( 2659 ).",

Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence A (High-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT)) Theoretically, chromium may have additive effects with antidiabetic agents and increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Some research shows that taking chromium might lower blood glucose levels, especially in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes ( 7137 , 14440 , 15169 , 94234 , 95097 , 95098 , 98687 ). more ASPIRIN Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination.

Animal research suggests that aspirin may increase chromium absorption and chromium levels in the blood ( 21055 ). more INSULIN Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, concomitant use of chromium and insulin might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. In clinical research, chromium has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity ( 1952 , 14440 , 95095 ), more LEVOTHYROXINE (Synthroid, others) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Chromium might bind levothyroxine in the intestinal tract and decrease levothyroxine absorption. Clinical research in healthy volunteers shows that taking chromium picolinate 1000 mcg with levothyroxine 1 mg decreases serum levels of levothyroxine by 17% when compared to taking levothyroxine alone ( 16012 ). Advise patients to take levothyroxine at least 30 minutes before or 3-4 hours after taking chromium. more NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDs) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination.

  "mechanism_text": "General Chromium (Cr) is a white, hard, brittle metal that is an essential trace element. The activity of chromium depends on its valance state. Metallic chromium, or chromium 0, has no activity. The other two common forms, chromium III (Cr III) and chromium VI (Cr VI), have different activities. Cr VI is typically used in chemical and welding industries and is carcinogenic to humans. Cr III is the form found in foods and supplements ( 13721 ). Chromium is sometimes referred to as glucose tolerance factor (GTF), but GTF is actually a complex of molecules found in the body that includes chromium bound to single molecules of glycine, cysteine, glutamic acid, and two molecules of nicotinic acid. Chromium is thought to be the active component of the complex. Some dietary sources of chromium include canned foods (due to chromium leaching from the can), meats and animal fats, fish, brown sugar, coffee, tea, some spices, calf liver, whole wheat bread, rye bread, and brewer's yeast ( 7061 ). Symptomatic chromium deficiency is rare. When it does occur, it is most often due to malnutrition, pregnancy, stress, or long-term use of chromium deficient total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Symptoms include severe glucose intolerance, weight loss, and metabolic encephalopathy ( 6863 , 13730 ). Although not yet confirmed, some researchers suspect that tissue levels of chromium might decline with age ( 6863 ). Antidiabetes effects People with diabetes may have lower chromium levels ( 7058 , 11908 , 13725 ). Low chromium levels are associated with impaired glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism, and resultant increased cardiovascular risk ( 95097 ). Some athletes might also be at risk for low chromium levels since strenuous aerobic exercise seems to increase urinary excretion of chromium ( 6860 , 6861 ). However, exercise-induced losses seem to be less in those who regularly exercise ( 6862 ). People who strength train seem to have increased absorption of chromium ( 7136 ). It is difficult to measure chromium status to determine who might require supplementation. Blood chromium levels are not in equilibrium with chromium stores and, therefore, do not provide a good indicator of chromium status ( 6859 ). However, elevated blood chromium levels may indicate excessive chromium exposure ( 11786 ). Levels in the urine and hair do not reflect overall chromium status ( 6867 ). There is no reliable method available to diagnose chromium deficiency, other than observing the outcome following supplementation in patients suspected of being deficient ( 3859 , 6869 ). Symptoms of chromium deficiency can include impaired insulin function and glucose tolerance, leading to elevations in insulin and fasting hyperglycemia, impairments in growth, increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides, neuropathy, weight loss, decreased respiratory function, and nitrogen metabolism abnormalities ( 6863 , 6869 , 11786 , 95098 ). Discovery of the role of chromium in insulin function occurred when patients on long-term TPN developed symptoms of diabetes that did not respond to insulin, but were reversed by chromium ( 6869 , 42641 , 42787 ). Because of the symptoms associated with chromium deficiency, researchers have speculated that chromium supplementation might be an effective treatment for diabetes. There is some evidence that patients with diabetes might have lower than normal levels of chromium due to increased chromium excretion ( 6858 ). However, patients with diabetes also seem to have increased gastrointestinal absorption of chromium. It's also theorized that patients with diabetes may not be able to adequately convert chromium from the diet to a usable form in the body ( 6867 ). Chromium seems to be transported to insulin-sensitive cells by transferrin, in response to increases in plasma insulin levels ( 6869 ). It is suspected to potentiate insulin by increasing receptor numbers and affinity, and increasing insulin binding to cells ( 6859 , 6867 ). Chromium increases insulin sensitivity through activation of signaling pathways involved with glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), leading to translocation ( 95097 ). Chromium may also enhance the synthesis of insulin receptor mRNA as well as insulin-like growth factor receptors ( 95097 ). A single oral dose of chromium before a high carbohydrate meal seems to lessen postprandial hyperglycemia in healthy, young volunteers. This suggests chromium potentiates the effect of insulin ( 13726 ). Additionally, chromium picolinate has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and stimulate insulin receptor sites in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 42554 ). Other clinical research shows that chromium dinicocysteinate can reduce insulin resistance by reducing oxidative stress and blood levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 42707 ). However, chromium picolinate does not appear to have these effects. In animal models, a chromium-containing peptide called chromodulin has been identified, which potentiates the actions of insulin at its receptors, including activation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity ( 6869 ). Additionally, in laboratory study, chromium activated trafficking of glucose transporter-4 and increased insulin-stimulated glucose transport through a cholesterol-dependent mechanism ( 42602 ). In patients with diabetes, these actions seem to translate into decreased insulin resistance, improved glucose tolerance, and lower blood glucose levels ( 6862 ). Researchers are interested in chromium for treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome due to its potential effects on lipids and body composition. Some clinical research shows that chromium might reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, and thereby some of the adverse effects and complications of diabetes ( 13724 ). A meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults, most of whom have diabetes, shows that chromium supplementation is associated with modest reductions in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and TNF-alpha when compared with control ( 105030 ). But the clinical significance of this is not known. Clinical research suggests that adding 100 mg of nicotinic acid 200 mcg of chromium chloride significantly improves glucose metabolism ( 11687 ); the effects of chromium may be augmented by nicotinic acid. Antioxidant effects Chromium is considered to have antioxidant effects ( 13724 , 42785 ). In human research, chromium dinicocysteinate supplementation significantly lowered protein carbonyl levels, a marker of protein oxidation, from baseline in diabetic patients ( 42707 ). Another study in diabetic patients reported an improvement in plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) ( 30863 ). In patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, chromium lowered levels of malondialdehyde ( 98687 ). A meta-analysis of patients with diabetes and other chronic disorders shows that taking chromium 400-1000 mcg daily for 8-24 weeks improves some markers of oxidative stress, such as malondialdehyde levels, when compared with control; however other markers, such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels, were not improved ( 110608 ). Some clinical research also shows that chromium might reduce oxidative stress in patients with diabetes; however, in patients without diabetes, chromium might act as a pro-oxidant ( 13724 ). Bone-resorption effects In vitro evidence suggests that chromium extract may increase the release of bone-resorbing cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus, when used as an alloying element in metallic implants, chromium may increase tissue damage and bone resorption surrounding a metallic implant ( 42784 ). Genetic effects Although laboratory studies have shown that trivalent chromium compounds can produce chromosome or DNA oxidative damage, human studies have not demonstrated these findings ( 42790 ). On the other hand, hexavalent chromium penetrates the cells easily (unlike trivalent chromium) and appears to induce oxidative damage to DNA ( 7326 , 42565 , 42749 , 42778 ). Growth effects There is interest in using chromium to enhance muscle protein synthesis. In the presence of sufficient essential amino acids or protein, insulin stimulates muscle protein synthesis. With low amounts of essential amino acids, insulin inhibits protein breakdown and has minimal effects on the rate of muscle protein synthesis. Therefore, it has been speculated that an improvement in insulin signaling combined with adequate doses of essential amino acids, could affect muscle protein synthesis ( 95099 ). Chromium is hypothesized to increase muscle mass by increasing amino acid uptake into muscle cells via potentiation of insulin activity ( 6862 , 42813 ). Laboratory research suggests that chromium picolinate increases internalization of insulin and increases leucine uptake in muscle cells. Because of its effects on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) translocation, and its ability to increase insulin response through the AMPK pathway, chromium has been used in clinical research to improve muscle protein synthesis. In one small clinical study in healthy young adults, taking a suboptimal dose of whey protein isolate (BiPro USA) 6 grams and a combination product containing chromium picolinate/histidinate and amylopectin (Velositol, Nutrition 21, LLC) 2 grams, followed by acute resistance exercise, significantly increased the muscle fractional synthesis rate compared to whey protein alone ( 95099 ). Also, evidence from animal research suggests that chromium supplementation can increase growth rate in mice and rats ( 42733 ). Immunomodulating effects In vitro evidence suggests that chromium extract reduces cell proliferation and inhibits interleukin (IL)-2-dependent response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to phytohemagglutinin. Thus, when used as an alloying element in metallic implants, chromium may reduce lymphocyte-mediated immune response to an infection that develops in tissue surrounding a metallic implant ( 42784 ). Lipid effects Chromium inhibits the hepatic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase leading to interference of cholesterol metabolism ( 95097 ). Neurologic effects It is theorized that chromium might enhance glucose utilization in the brain and stimulate norepinephrine release ( 2659 ). There is also interest in using chromium as an adjunct to antidepressant medications in people with depression. Preliminary clinical research suggests that chromium decreases endocrine responses to serotonin receptor stimulation, which could produce antidepressant activity ( 8929 ). A case series of adults with persistent depressive disorder shows that chromium supplementation might improve response to antidepressants, such as sertraline and amitriptyline, in patients with inadequate response ( 2659 ). However, clinical research in patients with atypical depression has yielded conflicting results ( 10309 , 42600 ). Weight loss effects Clinical research shows that ingestion of chromium picolinate reduces fat cravings, food intake, and hunger, which may lead to weight loss ( 42634 ). Chromium may induce these effects by affecting the brain's hunger receptors. Some research suggests that chromium might sensitize insulin-sensitive glucoreceptors in the brain, resulting in appetite suppression, activation of the sympathetic nervous system, stimulation of thermogenesis, and down-regulation of insulin secretion ( 6170 , 6860 ).",
