  "effectiveness_text": "Expand All | Collapse All Possibly Effective Diabetes. Oral fenugreek seed seems to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Meta-analyses of up to14 clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes or other metabolic conditions show that taking fenugreek with or without standard diabetes medications lowers fasting glucose by approximately 14-27 mg/dL, 2-hour postprandial glucose by 21-30 mg/dL, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by 0.5-1.2% when compared with placebo ( 90112 , 96065 , 105016 , 111503 , 112120 , 113499 , 113604 , 113630 ). The most effective doses and formulations seem to include powdered seed or debitterized seed powder 100 grams daily, taken as capsules or added to meals, for up to 3 years or seed hydroalcoholic extract about 1 gram daily for up to 2 months ( 90112 , 96065 , 105016 , 111503 , 112120 , 113499 ). The validity of these effects is limited by high heterogeneity and low quality in the included studies. Most research also shows that fenugreek seed lowers total cholesterol levels and triglycerides in patients with diabetes, but has inconsistent effects on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ( 96065 , 102252 , 113630 ). Some research shows that taking fenugreek in combination with other ingredients also seems to improve glycemic indices in people with diabetes. These combination products have combined fenugreek with guar gum and gymnema ( 10284 ) or millets and legumes ( 9784 ). Limited research has also evaluated fenugreek in type 1 diabetes. In one small clinical study, taking 50 grams of defatted fenugreek seed powder twice daily with meals for 10 days reduced 24-hour urine glucose levels by 54% when compared to baseline ( 622 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Dysmenorrhea. Oral fenugreek seed might help to reduce menstrual pain. A meta-analysis of 2 clinical studies in patients with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea shows that taking fenugreek capsules 5.4-6.3 grams daily for 3 days beginning on the first day of the menstrual cycle for 2 consecutive months reduces pain intensity when compared with placebo ( 113628 ). However, low-quality clinical studies show that fenugreek seed is not more effective for reducing menstrual pain when compared with garden cress or the anti-inflammatory medication mefenamic acid ( 113628 ). more Sexual arousal. Oral fenugreek seed might help to improve sexual arousal. Clinical research shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (Testofen, Gencor Pacific Ltd) 600 mg daily for 12 weeks increases sexual function by 15% over baseline, compared with no change in the placebo group; the main benefits were in sexual arousal and drive. Morning erection and sexual frequency also improve by 2- to 3-fold ( 93419 ). Another clinical study in healthy males shows that taking the same fenugreek seed extract 600 mg daily in combination with magnesium 34 mg, zinc 30 mg, and vitamin B6 10 mg for 6 weeks, improves a composite of symptoms such as sexual cognition, sexual arousal, sexual behavior, and orgasm. The overall improvement in the composite score was 23%, compared with a worsening in the placebo group ( 93421 ). more Sexual dysfunction. Oral fenugreek seed extract might help to improve sexual dysfunction. Clinical research shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (Libifem, Gencor Pacific Ltd.) 300 mg twice daily for two menstrual cycles improves sexual function in healthy pre-menopausal adults with low sex drive. In one clinical trial, overall improvement based on a composite of symptoms was 26% in the fenugreek group, compared with only 2% in the placebo group. Individual scores for sexual cognition, arousal, behavior, drive, and orgasm were all improved. Patients taking fenugreek also had an increased frequency of sexual activity from 1-2 times per month to once per week, compared to no change in the placebo group ( 93420 ). Other clinical research in males aged 35-60 years with symptomatic hypogonadism shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (Furosap; Chemical Resources) 500 mg daily after breakfast for 12 weeks improves sexual arousal, mental alertness, and mood when compared with baseline. This fenugreek seed extract was fortified with 20% protodioscin; the other constituents were not specified ( 108700 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of comparator group. more Possibly Ineffective Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Oral fenugreek extract does not seem to improve BPH symptoms. A clinical study in healthy adults with BPH shows that taking a specific fenugreek extract (Testofen, Bluegum Pharmaceuticals) 300 mg twice daily for 12 weeks does not improve BPH symptoms when compared with placebo ( 102253 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Alopecia areata. Although there is interest in using oral fenugreek for alopecia areata, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition. Alzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed extract is beneficial for Alzheimer disease. A moderate-sized study in adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease shows that taking fenugreek seed extract 5 mL daily for 4 months modestly improves memory but does not improve depression or quality of life measures when compared with placebo ( 113498 ). more Athletic performance. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for improving athletic performance. Research evaluating fenugreek for athletic performance has yielded inconsistent results. The reason for these mixed findings is unclear. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in healthy adult males shows that taking fenugreek or fenugreek seed extract 250-600 mg daily for 8-12 weeks does not improve upper or lower body strength, lean body mass, or fat mass when compared with placebo ( 113629 ). Other small clinical studies in resistance-trained young males show that taking a fenugreek supplement (AI or Torabolic, Indus Biotech; Fenu-FG, Indus Biotech Private Limited) for 8 weeks in addition to training does not improve power or strength when compared with placebo, but modestly improves some measures, such as leg and bench press performance, and slightly reduces body fat ( 18352 , 18353 , 93423 ). While most clinical research is in males, a clinical study in healthy adult females shows that taking fenugreek (Libifem, Gencor Pacific Ltd.) 600 mg daily for 8 weeks in conjunction with resistance training improves lower body strength, lean body mass, and fat mass when compared with placebo. However, there was no change in upper body strength, endurance, or power when compared with placebo ( 113631 ). more Atopic dermatitis (eczema). Although there is interest in using topical fenugreek for eczema, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition. Cough. Although there is interest in using oral fenugreek for cough, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this purpose. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It is unclear if oral fenugreek fiber is beneficial for improving heartburn symptoms. A small clinical study in patients with frequent heartburn shows that taking a specific fenugreek fiber product (FenuLife, Frutarom Belgium), 2 grams twice daily 30 minutes before the two biggest meals of the day, improves heartburn after one week of treatment and continuing through the 2-week study period. Fenugreek seemed to be similarly effective to ranitidine 75 mg twice daily ( 17372 ). more Gout. Although there is interest in using topical fenugreek for gout, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition. Hyperlipidemia. Small clinical studies suggest that oral fenugreek supplements might be beneficial for improving lipid levels. Overall, fenugreek powdered seed seems to modestly reduce lipid levels in people with or without hyperlipidemia; however, most studies have been low-quality, small, and exploratory. Meta-analyses of these studies show that fenugreek reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ( 103283 , 103284 ). Powdered fenugreek seed has been studied in doses of 0.5-100 grams daily for 10 days to 3 years. While some studies show modest improvement, others show no benefit ( 622 , 7389 , 9783 , 18359 , 18361 , 18362 , 102252 , 103283 , 103284 , 113497 ). more Hypertension. Analysis of small clinical studies suggests that oral fenugreek might slightly improve systolic blood pressure (SBP). A meta-analysis of 6 small clinical studies in healthy adults or those with diabetes, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome shows that taking fenugreek seed 0.5-50 grams daily for 6-144 weeks reduces SBP by 3.5 mmHg but does not improve diastolic blood pressure (DBP) when compared with placebo. However, subgroup analysis suggests that taking fenugreek at a dose of 15 grams or more daily or for a duration of 12 weeks or less modestly reduces DBP ( 112110 ). more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral fenugreek is beneficial in patients with prediabetes. A small clinical study in adults with prediabetes shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (Trigogen, Gencor Pacific Ltd.) 250 mg twice daily for 12 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose and postprandial blood glucose but not glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting insulin, or postprandial insulin when compared with placebo ( 113497 ). Another small clinical trial in patients with prediabetes shows that taking fenugreek seed extract 200 mg, bergamot extract 500 mg, and olive leaf extract 100 mg daily for 6 months does not improve glycated hemoglobin or fasting blood glucose when compared with placebo ( 102251 ). more Joint pain. Although there is interest in using oral fenugreek for joint pain, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition. Lactation. Small clinical studies suggest that oral fenugreek, either as a supplement or tea, might increase lactation. A network meta-analysis of 4 small clinical trials shows that taking fenugreek shortly after delivery may modestly increase breast milk production when compared with placebo. Patients in the included studies took fenugreek 1-2 grams as capsules or tea up to 3 times daily for 21-244 days. In most cases, fenugreek treatment was initiated one or two days after delivery. However, fenugreek might be less beneficial for breast milk production when compared with the natural ingredients Indian borage or palm date ( 96067 ). Fenugreek has also been used in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study suggests that drinking a specific herbal tea containing fenugreek. hibiscus, fennel, rooibos, vervain, raspberry, goat's rue, and fennel oil (Humana Still-Tee, Humana, Germany) 200 mL three times daily modestly increases milk production when compared with placebo ( 22569 ). Another study in exclusively breastfeeding parents of 2-month-old infants shows that eating lactation cookies containing fenugreek, oatmeal, brewer's yeast, and flaxseed meal daily for 30 days do not improve milk production, perceived insufficiency, or breastfeeding self-efficacy when compared with control ( 112116 ). more Male infertility. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for improving sperm quality in males with infertility. A small clinical study in healthy male patients ages 20-30 years with oligospermia shows that taking fenugreek seed oil 12 macro drops orally three times daily for 4 months improves sperm count from 6.2 million to 20.1 million, increases sperm motility from 43% to 61%, and reduces sperm abnormality from 68% to 53% when compared with baseline. However, taking the remaining fenugreek seed components 10 grams three times daily for 4 months does not seem to have this effect ( 90119 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Menopausal symptoms. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for improving menopausal symptoms. A small clinical study in perimenopausal patients shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract (FenuSMART) 250 mg, standardized to protodioscin 10.3%, trigonelline 3.1%, and total saponin 42.6%, twice daily with meals for 42 days does not improve menopausal symptoms when compared with placebo. However, there was a non-significant trend to reduced hot flashes, night sweats, depression, and insomnia in the treatment group ( 105000 ). This study was funded by the supplement manufacturer. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for metabolic syndrome. A meta-analysis of 29 small clinical studies in healthy adults or those with type 2 diabetes or other metabolic conditions shows that taking fenugreek at doses ranging from 25 mg to 60 grams daily for up to 144 weeks reduces fasting blood glucose by 17 mg/dL, triglycerides by 20 mg/dL, waist circumference by 2.5 cm, and systolic blood pressure by 3.5 mmHg and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 3.5 mg/dL when compared with control. However, no effect was found on diastolic blood pressure or body mass index ( 113500 ). more Muscle strength. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for increasing muscle strength. A small study in healthy, active males shows that taking fenugreek seed extract 400 mg or 500 mg daily for 60 days increases grip strength when compared with placebo ( 103285 ). more Myalgia. Although there is interest in using topical fenugreek for myalgia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition. Obesity. Small clinical studies suggest that oral fenugreek seed or fiber may increase satiety and decrease caloric intake. Two small clinical studies in overweight and normal weight males shows that taking fenugreek seed extract modestly reduces daily fat intake. At a dose of 392 mg three times daily for 2-6 weeks, fat intake is reduced by 13% to 17%. However, a lower dose of 196 mg three times daily appears to be ineffective. Neither of the doses affect weight, appetite, or satiety ( 18348 , 18349 ). Another small clinical study in obese adults shows that adding 8 grams of fenugreek fiber powder (FenuLife, Frutarom Inc) to a low-calorie beverage increases feelings of satiety and decreases hunger and lunchtime food intake. A lower dose of 4 grams appears to be less effective for reducing hunger but was considered to be more palatable ( 18350 ). more Parkinson disease. It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for Parkinson disease symptoms. One small clinical study in patients with Parkinson disease who are also using levodopa shows that taking fenugreek seed extract (Indus Biotech Private Limited, Pune) 300 mg twice daily for 6 months does not seem to improve behavioral or motor symptoms when compared with placebo ( 90113 ). more Peptic ulcers. Although there is interest in using oral fenugreek for peptic ulcers, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this condition. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral fenugreek seed is beneficial for PCOS. A small clinical study in adults with symptomatic PCOS shows that adding a specific fenugreek seed extract (Goldarou Pharmaceutical Co.) 500 mg twice daily to metformin for 8 weeks does not improve insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity, or other symptoms when compared with placebo and metformin ( 90117 ). However, other small clinical studies in adults with PCOS show that taking another specific fenugreek seed extract (Furocyst, Cepham Inc.) 1000 mg, enriched with 40% furostanolic saponins, daily for 90 days is associated with a reduction in ovarian cyst size in 46% of patients, complete dissolution in 36% of patients, normalization of menstrual cycles in 71% to 80% of patients, and subsequent pregnancy in 12% of patients. Further, this extract appears to reduce mean cyst size by 42% to 45%, the number of cysts by 38%, ovary volume by 24% to 40%, and hirsutism by 27% while reducing luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, free testosterone, and prolactin and improving liver function and the severity of PCOS-associated ailments including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia ( 93422 , 112112 , 113502 ). The validity of some of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Furthermore, this study was funded by the supplement manufacturer. more Vaginitis. There is limited evidence on the topical use of fenugreek cream in patients with atrophic vaginitis. One small clinical study in postmenopausal patients with atrophic vaginitis shows that administration of 0.5 grams of fenugreek 5% cream intravaginally twice weekly for 12 weeks reduces symptoms of atrophic vaginitis and reduces vaginal pH when compared to baseline. However, fenugreek was not as effective as vaginal cream containing conjugated estrogens ( 103286 ). Another small clinical study in postmenopausal patients with vaginal atrophy shows that applying a fenugreek cream 5% intravaginally daily for 8 weeks seems to reduce dyspareunia and vaginal dryness and increase vaginal maturation when compared with a placebo cream ( 105023 ). more Wound healing. Although there is interest in using topical fenugreek for wound healing, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of fenugreek for this purpose. More evidence is needed to rate fenugreek for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Likely Safe when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Fenugreek has Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the US ( 4912 ). Possibly Safe when the seed is used orally in medicinal amounts. Fenugreek seed powder 5-10 grams daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 3 years. Fenugreek seed extract 1 gram daily has been used with apparent safety for up to 3 months ( 7389 , 9783 , 18359 , 18362 , 49868 , 90112 , 90113 , 90117 , 93419 , 93420 )( 93421 , 93422 , 93423 , 96065 , 103285 , 108704 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods ( 4912 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of fenugreek when used in larger amounts. Unusual body and urine odor has been reported after consumption of fenugreek tea. Although the odor appears to be harmless, it may be misdiagnosed as maple syrup urine disease ( 9782 , 96068 ). PREGNANCY: Likely Unsafe when used orally in amounts greater than those found in food. Fenugreek has potential oxytoxic and uterine stimulant activity ( 12531 ). There are case reports of congenital malformations, including hydrocephalus, anencephaly, cleft palate, and spina bifida, after consumption of fenugreek seeds during pregnancy ( 96068 ). Consumption of fenugreek immediately prior to delivery may cause the neonate to have unusual body odor. Although this does not appear to cause long-term sequelae, it may be misdiagnosed as maple syrup urine disease ( 9781 , 96068 ). LACTATION: Possibly Safe when used orally to stimulate lactation, short-term. Although most available clinical studies lack safety testing in the lactating parent or infant ( 12535 , 22569 , 22570 ), some evidence suggests that taking fenugreek 1725 mg three times daily orally for 21 days does not cause negative side effects in the infant ( 90115 ).",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: Fenugreek seed powder has most often been used in doses of 5-10 grams daily for up to 3 years; daily doses as high as 100 grams have been used for up to 20 days. Fenugreek seed extract is most often used in doses of about 0.6-1.2 grams daily for up to 3 months ( 90112 , 93420 , 93422 , 96065 ). See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Topical: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Standardization & Formulation One capsule of a specific fenugreek product (FenuLife, Frutarom Belgium) has been standardized to contain 500 mg of fractioned tempered fenugreek seeds (85% total fiber) and galactomannan with a 1:1 mannose to galactose ratio ( 17372 ). One capsule of a different fenugreek product (Libifem, Gencor Pacific Ltd.) contains 300 mg of an extract equivalent to 9.9 grams of dry fenugreek product and is standardized to 50% saponin glycosides ( 93420 ). Another fenugreek product is an extract standardized to 40% furostanolic saponins (Furocyst, Cepham Inc.). Each capsule contains 500 mg fenugreek extract. Batch #FCYS0813 was used in the study ( 93422 ). Fenu-FG capsules contain 300 mg of fenugreek furostanol glycosides (Indus Biotech Private Ltd., Pune, India), characterized by HPLC fingerprinting ( 93423 ). Another fenugreek extract (Testofen, Gencor Pacific Ltd) has been used in clinical trials ( 93419 , 93421 ).",
  "interactions_text": "Expand All | Collapse All ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, fenugreek might have additive effects when used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. Some of the constituents in fenugreek have antiplatelet effects in animal and in vitro research. However, common fenugreek products might not contain sufficient concentrations of these constituents for clinical effects. A clinical study in patients with coronary artery disease or diabetes shows that taking fenugreek seed powder 2.5 grams twice daily for 3 months does not affect platelet aggregation, fibrinolytic activity, or fibrinogen levels ( 5191 , 7389 , 49643 ). more ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, fenugreek seed might have additive hypoglycemic effects when used with antidiabetes drugs. Clinical research shows that fenugreek seed can reduce fasting blood glucose and 2-hour postprandial glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes ( 10284 , 90112 , 96065 , 105016 ). more CLOPIDOGREL (Plavix) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, fenugreek seed might alter the clinical effects of clopidogrel by inhibiting its conversion to the active form. Animal research shows that fenugreek seed 200 mg/kg daily for 14 days increases the maximum serum concentration of clopidogrel by 21%. It is unclear how this affects the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of clopidogrel; however, this study found that concomitant use of fenugreek seed and clopidogrel prolonged bleeding time by an additional 11% ( 108701 ). more METOPROLOL (Toprol) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, fenugreek seed might have additive hypotensive effects when used with metoprolol. Animal research shows that fenugreek seed 300 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks decreases systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 9% and 11%, respectively, when administered alone, and by 15% and 22%, respectively, when given with metoprolol 10 mg/kg ( 108703 ). more PHENYTOIN (Dilantin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, fenugreek might decrease plasma levels of phenytoin. Animal research shows that taking fenugreek seeds for 1 week decreases maximum concentrations and the area under the curve of a single dose of phenytoin by 44% and 72%, respectively. This seems to be related to increased clearance ( 110905 ). So far, this interaction has not been reported in humans. more SILDENAFIL (Viagra) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, concurrent use of sildenafil and fenugreek might reduce levels and therapeutic effects of sildenafil. Animal research shows that taking fenugreek seeds for 1 week reduces maximum concentrations and the area under the curve of a single dose of sildenafil by 27% and 48%, respectively ( 110898 ). So far, this interaction has not been reported in humans. more THEOPHYLLINE Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, fenugreek may reduce the levels and clinical effects of theophylline. Animal research shows that fenugreek 50 grams daily for 7 days reduces the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of theophylline by 28% and the area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve (AUC) by 22% ( 90118 ). more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, fenugreek might have additive effects with warfarin and increase the international normalized ratio (INR). Some fenugreek constituents have antiplatelet effects, although these might not be present in concentrations that are clinically significant ( 7389 ). In one case report, a patient taking warfarin experienced an increased INR when starting to take fenugreek in combination with boldo ( 5191 ). more",
  "mechanism_text": "General The applicable part of fenugreek is the seed. The dried or fresh leaves are also used as an herb or vegetable ( 96068 ). Fenugreek constituents include flavonoids, alkaloids, coumarins, and saponins ( 96068 ). Fenugreek seeds have a distinctive bitter taste and odor due to the alkaloids of volatiles found in the seed ( 96068 ). The active constituents include trigonelline, 4-hydroxyisoleucine, and sotolon ( 12533 , 49582 ). Sotolon is frequently used as a flavoring for artificial maple syrup ( 12533 ). Soaking fenugreek seeds overnight and washing the seeds in water can decrease some of the taste and odor ( 9783 ). Other constituents of fenugreek include steroidal saponins, including diosgenin ( 49571 , 49683 ), yamogenin ( 96068 ), protodioscin ( 49573 ), and trigoneosides ( 49543 ). Fenugreek seeds are high in dietary fiber, including galactomannan ( 49655 , 49774 ). They contain about 50% dietary fiber and pectin. Fenugreek seed is also a good source of protein ( 49827 ). About 80% of the total content of free amino acids in the seeds is present as 4-hydroxyisoleucine ( 12533 , 49641 ). Fenugreek seed oil contains the following fatty acids: linoleic, oleic, linolenic, arachidic, palmitolic, eicosadienoic, palmitic, stearic, and myristic acids, with combined linoleic and oleic acids making up 67% to 76% of fatty acids ( 90119 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Fenugreek is used in traditional topical anti-inflammatory treatments. In various animal models, fenugreek seed extract had anti-inflammatory effects. However, a mechanism of action is not clear ( 49550 , 49720 ). Anticancer effects Fenugreek is traditionally used orally for cancer prevention. Epidemiological evidence suggests that a diet rich in fresh vegetables, including fenugreek leaves, protected against gallbladder cancer ( 49651 ). In animal research, fenugreek seeds inhibited colon carcinogenesis ( 49601 , 49686 ) and breast cancer ( 49631 ). This may be due to the apoptotic and growth inhibitory effects of fenugreek and its constituents on cancer cells, as shown in vitro ( 49573 , 49692 , 49724 ). Although the mechanisms of action are not clear, various laboratory studies have shown that fenugreek constituents interfere with cell signaling pathways in cancer cells ( 49731 , 49751 ), as well as increase antioxidant status ( 49686 ). Antidiabetic effects Many clinical studies show that taking fenugreek seed improves postprandial and fasting blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance test results, and 24-hour urinary glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 90112 , 96065 ). In patients with type 1 diabetes, 50 grams of defatted fenugreek seed powder taken twice daily with meals for 10 days reduced 24-hour urine glucose levels by 54% ( 622 ). Fenugreek seeds contain about 50% dietary fiber and pectin and may affect gastrointestinal transit, slowing glucose absorption ( 49723 , 49791 ). About 80% of the total content of free amino acids in the seeds is present as 4-hydroxyisoleucine, which appears to directly stimulate insulin ( 8112 , 12532 , 12533 ). This effect is glucose-dependent and only occurs in the presence of moderate to high glucose concentrations. In other laboratory research, fenugreek seed extract appears to stimulate the effects of insulin in adipocyte, muscle, and liver cells ( 49635 , 49659 ). Other fenugreek constituents with potential hypoglycemic effects include trigonelline, as shown in animal research ( 49763 ). Antioxidant activity The antioxidant effects of fenugreek and its constituents may explain some of its clinical effects. Antioxidant effects of fenugreek have been shown in various animal models, resulting in improvements in both antioxidant and oxidant levels ( 49526 , 49565 , 49586 , 49640 , 49686 , 49754 , 49866 ). Antiplatelet activity Fenugreek contains coumarins and other constituents that might affect platelet aggregation, but these constituents may not be present in quantities that would produce clinically significant effects ( 7389 ). In animal research, a fenugreek leaf extract inhibited adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation ( 49643 ). Antiulcer effects Fenugreek is traditionally used for dyspepsia, GERD, and mouth ulcers. Animal research shows that fenugreek protects against aspirin- and ethanol-induced gastric injury, possibly by increasing the antioxidant activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and by decreasing thiol groups ( 49867 , 113501 ). It was also suggested that fenugreek gel has effects on mucosal glycoproteins and prevents a rise in lipid peroxidation induced by aspirin ( 49867 ). However, in laboratory research, fenugreek extract did not have bactericidal effects against Helicobacter pylori ( 36131 ). Ergogenic effects In young males, a specific fenugreek extract (Torabolic, Indus Biotech) increased leg and bench press performance ( 18353 ). Clinical research in untrained adults performing an incremental cycle to exhaustion test shows that taking either a specific fenugreek soluble fiber (FenuMAT; Akay Group, Ltd) 300 mg or a specific combination product containing turmeric and fenugreek (CurQfen; Akay Group Ltd) 500 mg daily for 28 days increases ventilatory threshold, but has no effect on peak oxygen consumption or respiratory exchange ratio, when compared with placebo ( 108702 ). Other human studies have examined the possible mechanism of action on exercise performance. Although the constituent amino acid, 4-hydroxyisoleucine, increased muscle glycogen concentration ( 49624 ), fenugreek extract was found to have no effect on muscle glycogen synthesis ( 49689 ). In animal research, fenugreek increased swimming endurance, perhaps by increasing the utilization of fatty acids as an energy source ( 49664 ). Hormonal effects In males with oligospermia, fenugreek seed oil, but not remaining fenugreek seed components, improves sperm count and quality ( 90119 ). These improvements have also been observed in males with primary hypogonadism using a specific fenugreek seed extract (Furosap; Chemical Resources) ( 108700 ). In males, fenugreek has been shown to increase testosterone levels. This is mainly due to an increase in free testosterone and not total testosterone ( 18352 , 93419 , 93423 , 103282 ). Other clinical research in males with symptomatic hypogonadism shows that taking a specific fenugreek seed extract fortified with protodioscin 20% (Furosap; Chemical Resources) 500 mg daily for 12 weeks increases free and total testosterone levels by 0.9 ng/dL and 110 ng/dL, respectively, and modestly decreases dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S) levels when compared with baseline ( 108700 ). This increase in testosterone levels is also seen in animal models of diabetes or testicular damage ( 93424 , 93426 ) but not in castrated animals where only total testosterone was measured ( 93425 ). However, in one study of healthy young males, fenugreek extract did not increase testosterone levels ( 93421 ). It is possible that fenugreek extract only improves testosterone levels in individuals with lower baseline levels. Fenugreek also appears to increase testosterone levels in females ( 93420 ). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, it has been suggested that fenugreek saponins might increase testosterone levels by partially inhibiting 5-alpha reductase and aromatase enzymes ( 93419 ) or upregulating enzymes involved in steroid synthesis in the testis ( 93426 ). The fenugreek saponins might also bind to estrogen receptors and induce estrogen-responsive genes ( 93420 , 93421 ). In females, fenugreek extract increases estradiol levels ( 93421 ), as well as luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ( 93422 ). Fenugreek extract does not appear to alter levels of DHEA-S, androstenedione, estradiol, sex hormone-blinding globulin, or prolactin ( 93419 ). Animal models suggest the potential for anti-fertility, abortifacient, and teratogenic effects at oral doses of at least 100 mg/kg. In male animals, complete infertility, hormonal changes, and sperm toxicity, including decreased sperm count and motility and morphological abnormalities, have been seen. In female animals, high levels of fenugreek have resulted in changes in hormone levels, decreased implantation rates, and increased abortifacient effects. Fetal size was reduced and fetal mortality increased ( 96068 ). Teratogenic effects include neurological abnormalities ( 96068 ). The human equivalent of the lowest dose causing negative effects during pregnancy is 972 mg per 60 kg ( 96068 ). Hypolipidemic effects Preliminary clinical research shows that taking fenugreek seed reduces total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but has inconsistent effects on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides ( 622 , 7389 , 9783 , 18359 , 18361 , 18362 ). In vitro, the hypolipidemic effect of fenugreek seeds was thought to be mediated through inhibition of fat accumulation and upregulation of the LDL receptor ( 49746 ). The hypolipidemic effects of fenugreek may also be due to their constituent saponins. Saponins are altered to sapogenins in the gastrointestinal tract. Sapogenins increase biliary cholesterol secretion, potentially leading to lower serum cholesterol levels ( 49766 , 49839 ). Renoprotective effects Some evidence from animal research suggests that fenugreek seed consumption might decrease calcium oxalate deposition in the kidneys ( 720 , 49687 ). Stimulating effects Preliminary research suggests fenugreek has stimulating effects on the uterus, intestine, and heart ( 12531 ). Teratogenic effects Animal research shows that fenugreek has antifertility and teratogenic effects ( 96068 ). These effects might be related to the hormonal activities of the saponins in fenugreek. Also, the flavonoids in fenugreek could cross the placenta and cause pro-oxidant effects, damaging the DNA ( 96068 ). Neurotoxic effects of fenugreek have been shown in animal models suggesting that prenatal exposure to fenugreek could impact the neurological development and later performance ( 96068 ). Although the mechanism of action is not clear, the monoaminergic and cholinergic systems might be involved ( 96068 ). Fenugreek also seems to inhibit hematopoietic regulatory elements in bone marrow, altering the hematological count of the fetus ( 96068 ). Weight loss effects In short-term human research, a fenugreek seed extract has been shown to reduce daily fat intake but it does not appear to affect weight, appetite, or satiety ( 18348 , 18349 ). Fenugreek fiber intake at breakfast increases feelings of satiety ( 18350 ). Although effects on weight loss in humans is not clear, in animal models, fenugreek fiber and seed extract have been shown to reduce body weight and food intake ( 49634 , 49681 ).",
