  "warnings": "Due to the potential risk for hepatotoxicity with green tea extracts, products claiming compliance with United States Pharmacopeia (USP) quality standards for green tea extract must include the following text on the label: \"Do not take on an empty stomach. Take with food. Do not use if you have a liver problem and discontinue use and consult a healthcare practitioner if you develop symptoms of liver trouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)\" ( 102722 ).",

A specific green tea extract ointment (Polyphenon E ointment 15%) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating external genital warts caused by HPV. A specific green tea extract ointment (Veregen, Bradley Pharmaceuticals; Polyphenon E ointment 15%, MediGene AG) providing 150 mg of sinecatechins per gram of ointment, applied three times daily to external warts, completely clears external genital and perianal warts in 24% to 60% of patients after 10-16 weeks of treatment ( 15067 , 36438 , 36442 , 53777 , 53907 , 54018 ). This green tea extract is an FDA-approved prescription product ( 15067 ). more Possibly Effective Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Drinking green tea seems to reduce the risk of CVD and CVD-related mortality. Large-scale population research in Japan suggests that consuming at least 3-5 cups of green tea daily is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality when compared with drinking less than 1 cup daily. This association appears to be primarily related to a decrease in risk for cerebral infarction and heart disease. This association appears to be stronger in females than in males ( 14498 , 53789 , 100202 ). Population research also suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of CVD. One meta-analysis suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a 28% reduced risk of CAD ( 54017 ). Another meta-analysis suggests that consuming small to moderate amounts of green tea, 1-5 cups or 300 to 1500 mL daily, is associated with an 8% to 16% reduced risk of coronary heart disease over 5 to 13 years when compared with consuming no green tea ( 111017 ). One meta-analysis suggests that a 1 cup increase in green tea consumption is associated with a 5% reduced risk of CVD mortality and a 3% reduced risk of CVD events ( 102728 ). When compared with drinking less than 1 cup of green tea daily, epidemiological research in a population at high risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) suggests that drinking more than 3 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 46% reduced odds of having CAD, especially severe CAD, as determined by a coronary angiography ( 104588 ). A sub-group analysis suggests that these odds only occurred in individuals consuming fruits more than 4 times weekly and not in individuals consuming fruits less often ( 104588 ). However, some population research suggests that any association seems to be greater for males than females ( 53691 ). Other population studies suggest that general tea consumption might protect against ischemic heart disease or death from CVD; however, many of the tea drinkers in some of these studies consumed black tea rather than green tea ( 8119 , 8120 , 8121 , 102728 ). more Endometrial cancer. Drinking green tea seems to be beneficial for endometrial cancer prevention. Meta-analyses of epidemiological research have found that people who drink green tea often, usually more than once daily, have a 21% to 23% reduced risk of developing endometrial cancer when compared with those who never or rarely drink green tea ( 53919 , 92409 , 102716 ). One of these meta-analyses also found that increasing green tea intake by one cup per day is associated with an 11% reduced risk of developing endometrial cancer ( 92409 ). more Hyperlipidemia. Oral green tea seems to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by a small amount. Clinical research and a meta-analysis of clinical research in people with or without hyperlipidemia shows that consuming green tea or green tea extract containing 150-2500 mg catechins daily for up to 24 weeks reduces total cholesterol by about 5-24 mg/dL and LDL cholesterol by about 2-25 mg/dL when compared with control ( 11308 , 54038 , 54048 , 90146 , 90161 , 97135 , 104605 ). There is also preliminary evidence that taking a green tea extract containing catechins 676 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces oxidation of LDL cholesterol when compared with placebo, which might lead to reduced damage to the vascular endothelium and reduced arteriosclerosis ( 98458 ). Epidemiological research has found that higher consumption of green tea, especially 10 cups daily or more, is associated with improved serum lipids in males, but not females ( 6403 , 97134 ). more Ovarian cancer. Drinking green tea seems to be beneficial for ovarian cancer prevention. Consuming tea, including green tea or black tea, appears to significantly lower the risk of developing ovarian cancer when compared with never or seldom consuming tea ( 9228 , 13208 , 90144 , 102716 ). One meta-analysis of population research suggests that the highest intake of green tea is associated with a 36% reduced risk of ovarian cancer when compared with the lowest intake ( 102716 ). Also, one prospective population study found that those who consume 2 or more cups of tea daily have a 46% lower risk of ovarian cancer when compared with those who don't regularly consume tea ( 13208 ). There also appears to be a trend that suggests higher consumption of tea or longer duration of use further reduces the risk of ovarian cancer ( 9228 , 13208 ). However, green tea does not appear to prevent ovarian cancer recurrence. Preliminary clinical research shows that drinking 500 mL of double-brewed green tea (DBGT), prepared with 35 grams/L of tea leaves standardized to contain approximately 640 mg/L of EGCG, daily for up to 18 months does not prevent cancer recurrence in adults with a history of advanced stage serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer ( 90175 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acne. Topical green tea might reduce acne lesions by a small amount. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for acne. A meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research shows that topical application of green tea extract reduces the number of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions by a small amount ( 104609 ). In one small study, applying a solution containing the green tea constituent epigallocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 1% or 5% twice daily for 8 weeks was used ( 54074 ). However, oral green tea extract had limited or no effect in one study included in a meta-analysis ( 104609 ). Higher quality studies are needed to confirm this finding. more Age-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for cognitive decline associated with age. In elderly individuals living in the community, clinical research shows that taking matcha green tea powder (Yabukita, Kyoeiseicha Co., Ltd.) 3 grams daily for 12 weeks does not improve overall measures of cognitive function when compared with placebo. However, a sub-group analysis in females found a small improvement in language, but not other measures, including memory, impulsivity, and attention ( 104602 ). Other clinical research in middle aged and older adults shows that taking green tea extract (Thea-Flan 90S, ITO EN Ltd.) providing catechins 336.4 mg daily for 12 weeks does not improve most measures of cognitive function, although there was a small effect on one measure of working memory. In addition, a single dose has a small effect on errors during an attention task ( 104603 ). more Amyloidosis. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for amyloidosis. Preliminary clinical research in patients with cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis shows that drinking green tea (Green Darjeeling, FTGFOP1, Teekampagne Projektwerkstatt GmbH) 1.5-2 liters standardized to contain epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 340 mg/L and/or taking specific capsules (Praevent-loges, Dr. Loges + Co. GmbH) containing 300 mg green tea extract standardized to contain EGCG 75 mg/capsule for 12 months protects against an increase in left ventricular wall thickness and left ventricular myocardial mass ( 54064 ). more Anxiety. Although there has been interest in using oral green tea for anxiety, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition. Athletic performance. The evidence on the effects of green tea constituents for athletic performance is conflicting. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking green tea extract containing up to 572.8 mg of catechins as a beverage does not improve respiration efficiency, maximal oxygen uptake, or time trial performance in individuals undergoing endurance training when compared with beverages without catechins ( 53987 , 53991 ). However, other preliminary research shows that taking specific pills (Teavigo, Healthy Origins) containing epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 135 mg/pill, taken three times daily with meals for a total dose of seven pills, improves maximal oxygen uptake but not maximum work rate or respiration efficiency, in healthy adults when compared with placebo ( 53944 ). Also, a small study in untrained adults shows that taking a single dose of green tea polyphenols 640 mg, 90 minutes before exercise, increases maximal oxygen uptake. However, the effect on athletic performance was not determined ( 104606 ). more Beta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for reducing iron accumulation in beta-thalassemia. A small clinical trial shows that taking green tea 3 cups daily after meals for 12 months, in addition to usual treatment with blood transfusions and deferasirox, an iron chelator, reduces levels of liver iron and serum ferritin by moderate amounts when compared with usual treatment alone. Hemoglobin values did not differ between groups. Each green tea bag contained 2 grams green tea (Lipton, Unilever Gulf) ( 104601 ). more Bladder cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for bladder cancer prevention. Some epidemiological evidence suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer ( 1458 , 1459 , 90179 ). However, conflicting evidence exists. A meta-analysis of some epidemiological evidence suggests that drinking green tea is not associated with a reduced risk of bladder cancer ( 54077 , 90166 , 102716 ). more Breast cancer. Evidence evaluating the association between green tea intake and breast cancer risk is inconsistent; any association may be dependent on genotype and menopausal status. Meta-analyses of cohort and case-control studies have found that green tea intake is not associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer ( 98460 , 102716 ). However, some individual population studies suggests that green tea intake is associated with a reduced odds of developing breast cancer in Asian-American ( 14427 , 53866 ), but not Asian ( 13189 , 14426 , 90181 ), populations. Any protective effect of green tea on breast cancer risk might depend on patient genotype or menopausal status. Green tea consumption does not seem to lower breast cancer risk in Asian females with low-activity angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) genotype, although it does seem to decrease breast cancer risk in Asian females with high-activity ACE genotype ( 14430 ). Similarly, Asian-American females who drink green tea seem to have a lower breast cancer risk if they have low-activity catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype. However, they do not seem to benefit if they do not have the low-activity COMT genotype ( 14431 ). Additionally, some observational research suggests that there is a link between green tea and modestly reduced breast cancer risk in pre-menopausal, but not postmenopausal, females ( 99788 ). Some research has evaluated the effect of green tea on breast cancer recurrence. Population research suggests that Asian females who have had stage I or II breast cancer who drink at least 3 cups of green tea daily seem to have reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence ( 3926 , 13189 , 54112 ). However, drinking green tea does not seem to significantly reduce the risk of recurrence of later-stage breast cancer. In April 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming green tea may reduce the risk of breast cancer, although the FDA has concluded that there is very little scientific evidence to support this claim ( 102106 ). more Cervical cancer. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for cervical cancer. Clinical research in adults with persistent high-risk HPV (HR HPV) infection and concomitant low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia shows that taking a specific green tea extract (Polyphenon E), four capsules standardized to contain epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 200 mg/capsule, once daily for 4 months does not affect HR HPV-positive status or histological outcomes when compared with placebo ( 90145 ). more Cervical dysplasia. It is unclear if topical green tea is beneficial for cervical dysplasia. Preliminary clinical research shows that applying a specific ointment (Polyphenon E ointment 15%, MediGene AG) containing epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) to human papilloma virus (HPV)-infected cervical lesions twice weekly and/or taking a specific green tea extract (Polyphenon E) 200 mg daily containing EGCG by mouth for 8-12 weeks can improve lesion appearance when compared with control ( 11310 ). more Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although there has been interest in using oral green tea for CFS, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is unclear if drinking green tea reduces the risk of COPD. One prospective, observational study in older adults has found that consumption of at least 3 cups daily of tea, including green tea, oolong tea, and black tea, is associated with a 23% reduction in COPD prevalence and a 65% reduced risk of developing COPD in models adjusted for potential confounders when compared with the lowest tea consumption ( 107201 ). However, green tea was only consumed by about 19% of the population included in this study and consumption of green tea itself was not associated with a reduced risk of COPD. more Cognitive function. It is unclear if oral green tea improves cognitive function in healthy adults. A small clinical study in adults ages 50-69 years shows that taking matcha powder (Hojin no shiro, Ito En, Ltd.) 9 capsules daily for 12 weeks, providing 170 mg total catechins daily, modestly improves some measures of attention and work performance when compared with taking placebo or caffeine. However, there was no effect on other measures of these outcomes, or on verbal memory tasks, visual information processing, working memory, motor function, or facial expression recognition ( 107168 ). Another small clinical study shows that taking a single dose of the green tea constituent, epigallocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG), 135 or 270 mg does not seem to improve mood or cognitive performance in healthy adults ( 54059 ). Green tea has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small clinical study in healthy adults shows that consuming a multi-ingredient beverage containing green tea powder 50 mg, elderberry extract, carob extract, and guarana seed extract improves some measures of cognitive function such as rapid visual information processing and multitasking, but not others, 120 minutes later when compared with placebo ( 113940 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to green tea, other ingredients, or the combination. more Cognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of mild cognitive impairment in elderly adults. Some population research in elderly individuals has found that drinking green tea at least once per week is associated with a 53% reduced incidence of dementia or mild cognitive impairment when compared to not consuming green tea ( 104598 ). In addition, drinking at least two cups of green tea daily was associated with a 54% lower prevalence of cognitive impairment ( 104611 ). A clinical study in adults with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive decline shows that taking oral matcha green tea powder capsules 2 grams daily for 12 months does not improve activities of daily living scores or measures of cognitive function compared with placebo ( 116753 ). Green tea has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. Some clinical research shows that taking two capsules of a specific combination product containing green tea extract 360 mg/capsule and L-theanine 60 mg/capsule (LGNC-07, LG Household & Health Care, Ltd) twice daily after meals for 16 weeks improves memory and attention in patients with mild cognitive impairment when compared with placebo ( 54019 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to green tea, other ingredients, or the combination. more Colorectal adenoma. It is unclear if oral green tea extract is beneficial for reducing colorectal adenoma recurrence. A large clinical trial in patients with previously removed colorectal adenomas shows that taking green tea extract (Dr. Loges + Co. GmbH) standardized to epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) 150 mg twice daily for 3 years does not affect the risk of developing new metachronous adenomas when compared with taking placebo ( 111020 ). However, a sub-group analysis shows that taking green tea extract results in a 10% absolute reduction in risk of adenoma formation in males, but not females ( 111020 ). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients with previously removed colorectal adenomas shows that taking green tea extract 1.5 grams daily for 12 months reduces the incidence of metachronous adenomas when compared with placebo ( 53816 ). more Colorectal cancer. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for colorectal cancer prevention. Although evidence from individual population studies is mixed ( 9222 , 9223 , 14498 , 90176 , 90178 , 90181 , 102718 ), meta-analyses of population research suggest that a high intake of green tea is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer ( 36416 , 102716 ). The highest intake of green tea is associated with a 16% reduced risk when compared with the lowest; however, the benefit appears to be specific to colon cancer, not rectal cancer ( 102716 ). When subdivided according to gender, evidence from case-control research suggests that green tea is associated with a reduced risk of colon and rectal cancer for females ( 54096 ). more Common cold. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for the common cold. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking two capsules of a specific formulation (ImmuneGuard, Nutraceutical Holdings LLC) containing L-theanine (Suntheanine, Taiyo International) plus epigallocatechin gallate (Sunphenon, Taiyo International) twice daily for 3 months reduces cold or flu symptoms and duration of symptoms when compared with placebo in healthy adults ( 53754 ). more Crohn disease. Although there has been interest in using oral green tea for Crohn disease, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition. Dementia. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for dementia prevention. A meta-analysis of observational studies in over 20,000 adults suggests that the risk of any cognitive deficit (including mild cognitive impairment and dementia) is associated with a 6% reduction per cup of green tea consumed daily ( 107829 ). Some population research in elderly individuals suggests that drinking green tea at least once per week is associated with a 53% reduced incidence of dementia or mild cognitive impairment when compared to not consuming green tea ( 104598 ). Other population research in adults ages 40-74 years suggests that drinking at least 600 mL of green tea daily is not associated with a reduced risk of developing dementia when compared with drinking less than 60 mL daily. However, there is a modest reduction in dementia risk specifically in individuals ages 60-69 years ( 107164 ). A prospective, observational study suggests that consumption of tea, including both green and black tea, of at least 4 cups, in conjunction with 0.5-1 cups of coffee, daily is associated with a 30% reduced risk of dementia when compared with not drinking tea or coffee. Also, drinking 2-3 cups daily of both tea and coffee is associated with a 28% reduced risk of dementia when compared with not drinking tea and coffee ( 107204 ). Any association between drinking green tea specifically and developing dementia cannot be determined from this study. more Dental plaque. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for reducing dental plaque. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that use of oral or topical products containing green tea modestly reduces dental plaque when compared with control products, including triclosan toothpaste, placebo, and chlorhexidine rinse. However, a sub-group analysis shows that a green tea rinse is no more effective than a chlorhexidine rinse. Green tea products in these studies included mouth rinse, paste, tea, capsules, and strips ( 107156 ). Many of these studies are limited by a lack of clear blinding. A more recent clinical study in children ages 10-14 years with plaque and gingivitis shows that using a mouthwash containing green tea extract 5% twice daily, alone or at half strength with ginger extract, for 30 days reduces plaque and gingivitis severity. The mouthwash containing the combination of green tea and ginger extract was most effective, and the green tea extract alone was at least as effective as chlorhexidine ( 107163 ). more Depression. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for depression prevention. Epidemiological research suggests that consuming green tea is associated with a reduced prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms. In Japanese adults, drinking four or more cups of green tea daily is associated with a 44% to 51% lower prevalence of mild to severe depression when compared to consuming one cup or less daily ( 90160 , 90163 ). A meta-analysis suggests that the highest green tea consumption is associated with a 34% reduced risk of depressive symptoms when compared with the lowest ( 111024 ). Other research in a general population of Chinese adults suggests that consuming at least 1 cup of green tea daily is associated with a 22% decreased risk of depressive symptoms over 2 years when compared with almost never consuming green tea. However, there is no association between depressive symptoms and less frequent green tea consumption in this population ( 111023 ). more Diabetes. It is unclear if drinking green tea or taking green tea extract is beneficial for the prevention of diabetes or the improvement of glycemic control. Epidemiological research has found that Japanese adults who consume 6 or more cups of green tea daily have a 33% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to those who consume one cup or less daily. The risk reduction appears to be more pronounced in females when compared with males ( 14313 ). Also, epidemiological research has found that Chinese adults who consume at least one cup of green tea per week have a 59% to 77% lower risk of impaired fasting glucose when compared to those who consume less than one cup per week ( 90149 ). Other epidemiological research has found that consumption of any amount of green tea daily by Chinese adults is associated with an 8% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with never drinking green tea ( 107165 ). In contrast, some epidemiological research in Chinese adults has found that green tea consumption is associated with a 20% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared with non-green tea drinkers. A dose-response relationship was found for both the amount and duration of tea consumed ( 107170 ). Also, clinical research in patients with prediabetes shows that drinking one cup of green tea three times daily for 14 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) when compared to control ( 90174 ). There is inconsistent evidence regarding the effects of green tea in patients with type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological research suggests that drinking at least 4 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 40% reduction in mortality risk when compared to not drinking green tea ( 104589 ). Other epidemiological research in patients with type 2 diabetes has found that consumption of any amount of green tea daily is associated with a 10% reduction in mortality risk when compared to never drinking green tea. However, there was no association between green tea intake and the incidence of developing macrovascular or microvascular complications ( 107165 ). Meta-analyses of clinical research show that green tea extract and green tea catechins reduce fasting blood glucose when compared to control when patients with type 2 diabetes, borderline diabetes, or normal blood glucose status are evaluated together ( 90154 , 90187 ). However, a meta-analysis of up to 15 mainly small clinical trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes shows that taking green tea does not affect fasting blood glucose or insulin or improve insulin resistance or glucose control when compared with placebo. Most included studies used green tea or its extract in doses of 400-10,000 mg daily for 8-16 weeks ( 104604 ). Also, clinical research shows that taking green tea extract daily for up to 16 weeks does not improve blood glucose, HbA1c, or insulin when compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes or borderline diabetes ( 37678 , 37781 , 54035 ). Some research has evaluated the effect of green tea on other outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. One meta-analysis shows that taking green tea extract modestly reduces fasting triglyceride levels when compared with control. This benefit was seen with doses of at least 800 mg daily taken for longer than 8 weeks. This dose and duration reduces levels of total cholesterol, but not low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels ( 102715 ). Another meta-analysis shows that taking green tea modestly reduces body weight, body mass index (BM), and body fat. A sub-analysis shows that these benefits occur in studies lasting more than 8 weeks, using doses of up to 800 mg daily, and in patients who were overweight. There was no effect on waist circumference. Most patients included in the analysis were overweight or had obesity ( 104610 ). more Diabetic neuropathy. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for improving diabetic neuropathy symptoms. Clinical research in patients with mild-to-moderate diabetic peripheral neuropathy shows that taking decaffeinated green tea extract 500 mg three times daily for 16 weeks modestly reduces neural pain and dysfunction, as well as overall symptom severity, when compared with placebo ( 107159 ). more Down syndrome. It is unclear if oral green tea is able to alter facial morphology in children with Down syndrome. A small case series has found that taking green tea extract daily, starting during the first 3 years of life, is associated with reduced facial dysmorphology in six of seven children with Down syndrome. There was no effect in children aged 4-18 years ( 107167 ). This study is limited by its observational design. The dosage, time of onset, and duration of treatment differed between individuals. more Dry eye. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for improving dry eye symptoms. In patients with mild to moderate dry eye and meibomian gland dysfunction, preliminary clinical research shows that applying green tea extract into the eyes three times daily for one month, in addition to artificial tears three times daily, improves symptoms of dry eye. Symptoms of itching, burning, foreign body sensation, and redness were improved by a moderate amount over artificial tears alone ( 104612 ). more Dysmenorrhea. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for preventing dysmenorrhea symptoms. Population research has found that drinking green tea is associated with a 37% reduced odds of experiencing dysmenorrhea and a 58% reduced odds of having moderate-to-severe dysmenorrhea when compared with not drinking green tea ( 102729 ). more Esophageal cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for preventing esophageal cancer; the available research is conflicting. Although some epidemiological evidence and observational studies have found that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of esophageal cancer, most meta-analyses do not support this finding in a mixed group of adults ( 1457 , 36542 , 90169 , 90185 , 90186 , 102004 , 102716 , 107154 ). Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies suggest that drinking green tea is associated with a 54% reduction in the risk of esophageal cancer, or a 21% reduced odds per cup of green tea consumed daily, only in females ( 90169 , 90185 , 102004 , 107154 ). Also, some epidemiological research found that drinking green tea that is very hot is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer ( 53828 ). In addition, drinking decaffeinated green tea 5 mg daily for 12 months does not seem to be an effective treatment for patients diagnosed with esophageal precancerous lesions ( 53702 ). more Fractures. It is unclear if drinking green tea reduces fracture risk. Population research has found that consumption of green tea is associated with a 12% lower risk of any fracture and 20% lower risk of hip fracture when compared with no tea consumption ( 99800 ). more Gastric cancer. Evidence evaluating an association between green tea consumption and gastric cancer risk is conflicting. Most meta-analyses of epidemiological studies suggest that green tea consumption is not associated with gastric cancer risk ( 53767 , 53813 , 90181 , 102716 ). Although the most recent meta-analysis of epidemiological research suggests that drinking green tea regularly is associated with up to a 9% reduced risk of gastric cancer when compared with non-regular consumption, sub-analyses suggest that there is no association between gastric cancer and intake of specific amounts of green tea up to at least 3 cups daily ( 111025 ). Also, other population research suggests that drinking 10 or more cups of green tea daily is associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer ( 8903 , 9222 , 9225 , 9226 , 9227 ), while consuming less than 10 cups daily is not consistently associated with a reduced risk ( 7033 , 9223 , 54090 ). The association between drinking green tea and gastric cancer-related mortality has also been investigated, A large-scale population study in Japan suggests that drinking 5 or more cups of green tea daily is not associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer-related mortality when compared to drinking less than one cup daily ( 14498 ). Discrepancies might be related to the temperature of the green tea. The most recent meta-analysis suggests that intake of cold or warm green tea, and not hot green tea, is associated with a modest reduction in gastric cancer risk ( 111025 ). more Gingivitis. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for gingivitis. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that use of oral or topical products containing green tea modestly reduces gingivitis and gingival bleeding when compared with control products, including triclosan toothpaste, placebo, and chlorhexidine rinse. However, a sub-group analysis shows that a green tea rinse is no more effective than a chlorhexidine rinse. Green tea products used in these studies were heterogeneous and included mouth rinse, gel, paste, tea, strips, and capsules ( 107156 ). Many of these studies are limited by a lack of clear blinding. A more recent clinical study in children ages 10-14 years with plaque and gingivitis shows that using a mouthwash containing green tea extract 5% twice daily, alone or at half-strength with ginger extract, for 30 days reduces plaque and gingivitis severity. The mouthwash containing the combination of green tea and ginger extract was most effective, and the green tea extract alone was at least as effective as chlorhexidine ( 107163 ). more Headache. Although there has been interest in using oral green tea for headache, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition. Hypertension. The evidence is mixed as to whether drinking green tea reduces the risk of hypertension and whether oral green tea lowers blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Some epidemiological research from China shows that drinking 120-599 mL of green tea or oolong tea daily is associated with a 46% lower risk of developing hypertension when compared with non-habitual tea drinkers; drinking more than 600 mL daily is associated with a 65% reduced risk ( 12518 ). In contrast, drinking green tea daily is associated with a 38% increased odds of having hypertension when compared with never drinking green tea in elderly Chinese males, but not females ( 107166 ). Green tea may help lower blood pressure in patients with or without hypertension; however, the evidence is mixed, and any reductions appear to be small. A meta-analysis of two clinical trials in patients with hypertension shows that drinking green tea for 4-16 weeks reduces systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure by about 6 mmHg ( 104583 ). Meta-analyses in patients with or without hypertension, including overweight or obese adults, suggest that green tea reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 1-3 mmHg ( 90146 , 90155 , 90161 , 98423 , 102726 , 111018 ). Some studies used green tea, made by boiling a 3 gram tea bag with 150 mL water and then waiting for 5 minutes and consuming three times daily approximately 2 hours after each meal for 4 weeks ( 90159 ), or green tea extract up to 1500 mg daily for up to 12 weeks ( 111018 ), including a specific product (Olimp Labs) 379 mg, taken daily with the morning meal for 3 months ( 54068 ). more Hypotension. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for postprandial hypotension in elderly adults. Some research shows that consuming caffeinated beverages increases blood pressure in elderly people with postprandial hypotension ( 11834 , 11835 ). Also, preliminary clinical research shows that drinking 400 mL of green tea before lunch increases postprandial systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 15 mmHg and 6 mmHg, respectively, in older elderly people with postprandial hypotension ( 89482 ). more Infertility. Oral green tea has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in females with a history of problems conceiving shows that taking three capsules daily of a proprietary blend of Vitex agnus-castus extract (standardized to 0.5% agnusides), green tea extract (standardized to 50% phenols), L-arginine, vitamins E, B6, and B12, folate, iron, magnesium, zinc, and selenium (FertilityBlend, The Daily Wellness Company) for three menstrual cycles increases the rate of pregnancy at three months by 61% when compared with placebo ( 41479 ). more Influenza. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing the flu. A meta-analysis of five clinical trials in individuals with or without prior influenza vaccination shows that use of green tea catechins, either in capsule form or as a gargled liquid, reduces the rate of influenza infections by 33% when compared with control. Also, a meta-analysis of observational research has found that gargling with or consuming green tea containing catechins is associated with a 48% reduced risk of influenza when compared with not taking green tea catechins. More information is needed to compare the efficacy of the different forms of green tea catechins ( 107152 ). Some epidemiological research not included in this meta-analysis has found that drinking at least 5 cups of green tea weekly is associated with a 32% reduced odds of developing confirmed influenza when compared with drinking less than one cup weekly. A sub-group analysis suggests that this association is only evident in individuals who had not received the influenza vaccination ( 104608 ). Conversely, other preliminary research shows that gargling with green tea at least three times daily for 90 days does not prevent influenza in high school students when compared with water ( 90150 ). Green tea has also been evaluated in combination with theanine. One small study shows that taking a combination of green tea catechins (THEA-FLAN 90S, Ito-en Co) 378 mg standardized to 270 mg of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) with theanine 210 mg daily for 5 months reduces the risk of developing clinically defined influenza, but not laboratory-confirmed influenza infection, when compared with placebo ( 54021 ). Other preliminary clinical research in healthy adults shows that taking two capsules of a specific formulation (ImmuneGuard, Nutraceutical Holdings LLC) containing L-theanine (Suntheanine, Taiyo International) plus EGCG (Sunphenon, Taiyo International) twice daily for 3 months reduces the number of subjects with cold or flu symptoms and the number of days with symptoms when compared with placebo ( 53754 ). more Japanese cedar pollinosis. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing Japanese cedar pollinosis symptoms. In patients with Japanese cedar pollinosis, clinical research shows that drinking Benifuuki green tea drink 350 mL containing O-methylated catechin 34-40 mg daily beginning 6-10 weeks before pollen exposure until the end of pollen season can reduce nasal and ocular symptoms. Clinical research compared the \"benifuuki\" drink enriched in O-methylated EGCG with that of another green tea \"yabukita,\" containing no O-methylated EGCG ( 53884 , 90156 ). more Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). It is unclear if drinking green tea prevents kidney stones. Population research suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of having kidney stones. This risk was 22% lower in males and 16% lower in females when compared with never or former green tea drinkers ( 104613 ). more Leukemia. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for leukemia prevention. Although some large epidemiological studies suggest that drinking green tea reduces the risk of leukemia by 51% to 80% ( 53799 , 90183 , 102723 ), a meta-analysis of generally low-quality population research shows a variable association between green tea intake and risk of leukemia ( 102716 ). more Liver cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for liver cancer prevention. Two meta-analyses of epidemiological research suggest that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer ( 97132 , 111016 ). The most recent meta-analysis in approximately 1.5 million adults in Asia, North America, and Europe suggests that the highest intake of green tea is associated with a 20% reduced risk of liver cancer when compared with the lowest. The most benefit was associated with consumption of at least 4 cups daily ( 111016 ). Another meta-analysis that included studies conducted in Japan, China, or Singapore suggests that higher green tea consumption is associated with a 12% reduced incidence of liver cancer when compared with the lowest consumption of green tea. However, the benefit appears to be limited to females; green tea consumption was not associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer in males ( 97132 ). A large epidemiological study in Chinese females also suggests that green tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer. Consuming a cumulative intake of 30 kg dried green tea leaves is associated with a 46% reduced risk of primary liver cancer over a median of 18 years when compared with never drinking green tea ( 111030 ). In contrast, some individual epidemiological studies suggest that green tea consumption is not associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer in Japanese individuals ( 90181 , 102716 ). more Lung cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for lung cancer prevention. Individual observational studies and meta-analyses of population research have yielded conflicting evidence about the effects of green tea on lung cancer risk ( 13190 , 14498 , 53829 , 90177 , 102716 ). Although one meta-analysis of population research suggests that the highest intake of green tea does not reduce lung cancer risk when compared to the lowest intakes ( 102716 ), other analyses suggest that increasing green tea consumption by two cups daily is associated with an 18% decreased risk of lung cancer, and that drinking 7-10 cups of green tea daily is associated with an 18% to 33% reduced risk of lung cancer when compared with drinking less than one cup daily ( 53829 , 90177 ). more Mental alertness. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for mental alertness. Green tea contains caffeine. Consumption of caffeinated beverages seems to prevent a decline in alertness and cognitive capacity when consumed throughout the day ( 4221 , 4224 ). Also, combining caffeine with glucose as an \"energy drink\" seems to improve mental performance better than placebo or either caffeine or glucose alone ( 13732 ). However, there is mixed evidence regarding the effects of green tea on mental alertness. more Metabolic syndrome. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for improving metabolic parameters in people with this condition. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking green tea extract 1000 mg daily or drinking four cups of green tea daily for 8 weeks does not improve metabolic syndrome features, including waist circumference, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, or blood sugar in obese patients with metabolic syndrome when compared to control ( 53995 ). more Multiple myeloma. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for multiple myeloma prevention. Population research suggests that drinking at least 5 cups of green tea each day is not associated with a reduced risk of multiple myeloma when compared with never drinking green tea ( 102723 ). more Myocardial infarction (MI). It is unclear if drinking green tea prevents MI or if drinking green tea prevents mortality in patients with a previous MI. When compared with drinking less than one cup of green tea daily, epidemiological research in a population at high risk of coronary artery disease has found that drinking more than three cups of green tea daily is associated with a 49% reduced odds of having a past MI as determined by a coronary angiography. A sub-group analysis found that these odds only occurred in individuals consuming both fruits and vegetables more than four times weekly and not in individuals consuming fruits or vegetables less often ( 104588 ). In addition, observational research has found that drinking either 1-3 cups or at least 4 cups of green tea daily is associated with 19% and 32% lower odds of MI, respectively, when compared to drinking less than 1 cup daily ( 97134 ). In patients with a previous MI, drinking at least 7 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 53% reduced odds of all-cause mortality over a median of 18.5 years when compared with not drinking green tea ( 107160 ). more Nasopharyngeal cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for nasopharyngeal cancer prevention. A meta-analysis of epidemiological research has found that the highest intake of green tea is associated with a 51% reduced risk of nasopharyngeal cancer when compared with the lowest intake ( 102716 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for NAFLD. Clinical research shows that drinking green tea 700 mL containing 1080 mg of catechins daily for 12 weeks does not affect body weight or body mass index (BMI), but does reduce body fat percentage from 34% to 32%, when compared with drinking either green tea 700 mL containing 200 mg of catechins or a control tea. Also, the liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio increased by 11% when compared with baseline ( 90168 ). Meta-analyses of four studies in patients with NAFLD show that taking green tea extract 500-1000 mg daily or green tea catechins 600 mg daily improves liver function tests when compared with placebo ( 98459 , 102720 ). One meta-analysis also shows that these doses improve BMI, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when compared with placebo ( 98459 ). more Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for non-Hodgkin lymphoma prevention. Population research has found that drinking at least 3.5 cups of green tea daily is not associated with a reduced risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma when compared with never drinking or drinking less than 1 cup of green tea daily ( 102005 , 102723 ). more Obesity. Evidence for the use of green tea products for weight loss is conflicting. The conflicting findings may be related to the caffeine and catechin content of the studied products, as well as the physical activity level of the individual. Many clinical studies show that drinking green tea or taking green tea extract that contains caffeine (about 70-200 mg) and high levels of catechins (about 576-886 mg) daily for 12-24 weeks modestly improves weight loss when compared to control in overweight individuals or patients with obesity ( 8114 , 37725 , 53906 , 90184 ). A meta-analysis of 25 randomized clinical trials shows that taking green tea extract containing caffeine results in an additional weight loss of 1.8 kg when compared with a control group not taking green tea extract ( 102719 ). In addition, a meta-analysis of clinical trials shows that taking green tea reduces body weight by 0.4 kg in mainly overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes ( 104610 ). Some research also shows that drinking green tea or taking green tea extract containing high levels of catechins but no caffeine reduces weight and visceral fat in overweight individuals or patients with obesity when used for up to 12 weeks ( 53994 , 54039 , 90184 ). In these clinical trials, the following doses have been used: two capsules of green tea extract daily standardized to containing 870 mg of catechins (460 mg EGCG) or 4 cups of green tea daily standardized to contain 928 mg of catechins (440 mg EGCG) for 8 weeks ( 53994 ); a specific decaffeinated green tea extract (Sunphenon 90LB, Taiyo Kagaku Ltd.) 530 mg twice daily for 6 weeks ( 54039 ); catechin-enriched green tea beverages providing 234-886 mg of catechins once or twice daily for approximately 3 months ( 37705 , 53906 , 90184 ); a specific green tea extract (AR25, Exolise, Arkopharma), taken as four capsules standardized to contain 375 mg of catechins (epigallocatechin gallate 270 mg) in two divided doses daily for 12 weeks ( 8114 ). Some research has also shown weight loss benefits of multi-ingredient products or diets containing green tea. Multi-ingredient products have included an herbal mixture of garcinia extract 650 mg, green tea extract 100 mg, coffee extract 75 mg, and banaba extract 25 mg per tablet (IQP-GC-101, InQpharm Europe Ltd.) 30 minutes before meals twice daily for 12 weeks ( 90137 ) and a specific product (Sanavita Industry, Piracicaba) containing powdered green tea (40 mg of caffeine), orange pulp, vitamin C, zinc, and selenium, taken as 20 grams in two divided doses daily for 8 weeks ( 90134 ). Drinking green tea has also been used as part of a Mediterranean diet also including Wolffia globose ( 109888 ). However, many studies show conflicting results ( 37715 , 37753 , 54035 , 98419 , 98420 , 98422 ). Reasons for these inconsistent findings are not entirely clear, but may relate to the use of decaffeinated green tea products, the use of green tea products containing low catechin amounts, or the presence and type of concomitant exercise. Some research shows that green tea extract containing a lower catechin amount (491 mg daily) or decaffeinated green tea products do not improve weight loss when compared with placebo in patients with obesity ( 37753 , 54035 , 98419 ). One meta-analysis of 15 clinical studies including about 1240 patients with obesity shows that using green tea products that are decaffeinated does not improve body weight, body mass index, or waist circumference when compared with control, while green tea products containing catechins 576-714 mg daily and caffeine do improve these outcomes ( 16892 ). Taking green tea after weight loss does not seem to improve weight maintenance when compared with control ( 14428 , 54076 ). Other clinical research shows that green tea does not improve weight loss in individuals with obesity who are already participating in exercise, such as walking and interval sprinting ( 37715 , 98420 ). In contrast, another small clinical study shows that taking green tea 500 mg daily for 10 weeks while participating in HIIT improves weight, body fat percentage, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels when compared with either green tea or HIIT alone. However, it appears that the majority of these improvements are due to participation in HIIT ( 100201 ). There is also some limited research in children. One small clinical trial in obese children ages 6-16 years shows that taking green tea providing 576 mg catechins daily for 24 weeks modestly reduces waist circumference, as well as systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, when compared with taking green tea providing 75 mg catechins daily. However, there were no significant difference between groups for other anthropometric measures or cardiovascular risk factors ( 37743 ). Another clinical trial in obese females ages 6-10 years who were also given diet and exercise advice shows that taking decaffeinated green tea polyphenols 400 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces fat mass, but does not affect other anthropometric measures, when compared with placebo. Also, taking green tea polyphenols modestly reduces ovary volume, but has no effect on other measures of early puberty, such as breast development, uterine volume, or levels of sex hormones ( 107162 ). more Oral cancer. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for oral cancer prevention. Meta-analyses of epidemiological research suggest that the highest intake of green tea is associated with a 20% to 29% reduction in risk of oral cancer when compared with the lowest intake ( 90180 , 102716 ). Also, preliminary clinical research in patients with high-risk oral premalignant lesions shows that taking a green tea extract 500-1000 mg/m2 three times daily after meals for 12 weeks increases the rate of clinical and histological response when compared with placebo ( 53936 ). more Oral leukoplakia. It is unclear if drinking green tea and concomitantly applying topical green tea to lesions is beneficial for oral leukoplakia. Preliminary clinical research in patients with oral leukoplakia shows that drinking 3 grams of a mixed tea product containing green tea daily for 6 months, while also topically applying a 10% mixed tea product in the mouth three times daily, reduces oral lesion size by about 38%, compared with a 3% increase in those taking placebo. It is not clear if this effect is due to green tea, the other ingredients, or the combination ( 4213 ). more Osteopenia. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing osteopenia. Population research suggests that drinking green tea for 10 years is associated with increased bone mineral density ( 8116 ). Other population research suggests that drinking less than one cup of green tea daily is associated with an 81% to 85% increased odds of having osteopenia when compared with drinking green tea 1-3 times daily ( 111026 ). Preliminary clinical research in postmenopausal adults with osteopenia shows that taking capsules containing green tea polyphenols 500 mg (233 mg as epigallocatechin-3-gallate or EGCG) daily, possibly while practicing tai chi 60 minutes three times weekly, for 24 weeks improves serum markers of bone turnover and muscle strength when compared to baseline ( 54040 ). However, the results from this study are limited by a lack of control group and the fact that diagnostic measures of bone health, such as T-score or Z-score, were not assessed. more Osteoporosis. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing osteoporosis. Population research suggests that drinking green tea for 10 years is associated with increased bone mineral density ( 8116 ). Other population research suggests that drinking less than one cup of green tea daily is associated with up to a 91% increased odds of having osteoporosis when compared with drinking green tea 1-3 times daily ( 111026 ). More recent clinical research shows that taking decaffeinated green tea extract supplying approximately 1315 mg of catechins (843 mg as EGCG) daily does not improve bone mineral density, T-score, or Z-score in postmenopausal adults ( 98419 ). more Overall mortality. Some population research suggests that drinking green tea may reduce the risk of overall mortality by a small amount. A meta-analysis of population research in Japanese adults found that drinking at least 5 cups of green tea daily is associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality when compared with drinking less than 1 cup daily ( 102002 ). Another meta-analysis of population research found that each one cup per day increase in green tea consumption is associated with a 3% reduced risk of all-cause mortality ( 102728 ). However, more recent population research has found that although drinking green tea is associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality in patients with a previous MI and stroke, drinking as much as 7 cups of green tea daily is not associated with a reduced odds of all-cause mortality over a median of 18.5 years in individuals with no history of stroke or MI when compared with not drinking green tea ( 107160 ). more Pancreatic cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for pancreatic cancer prevention. A meta-analysis of population research suggests that the highest intake of green tea is not associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer when compared with the lowest intake ( 102716 ). However, one epidemiological study suggests that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer ( 54096 ). more Parkinson disease. Although consuming caffeinated beverages might reduce the risk of developing Parkinson disease, it is unclear if oral green tea prevents or improves symptoms in people with this condition. There is some evidence from large-scale epidemiological studies that the incidence of Parkinson disease decreases with increased consumption of caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea, and cola. For men, the effects seem to be dose related. Men consuming a total of 421-2716 mg of caffeine (approximately 5-33 cups of tea) from any source daily seem to have the greatest reduction in risk. However, there seems to be a significant reduction in risk even with consumption of as little as 124-208 mg caffeine daily (approximately one to three cups tea) ( 6022 ). In females, the effects do not seem to be dose related. Moderate consumption of approximately 1-4 cups daily seems to provide the most reduction in risk ( 1238 ). It is unclear if consuming green tea is more or less effective than other caffeinated beverages for reducing Parkinson disease risk. more Periodontitis. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for improving oral health or improving periodontal disease. Epidemiological research has found that intake of green tea is inversely associated with symptoms of periodontal disease, including probing depth, attachment loss, and bleeding on probing ( 53844 ). A small clinical trial shows that taking green tea extract 1.55% by weight in chewable candy for 28 days appears to reduce plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation ( 7594 ). A small clinical trial in patients with chronic periodontitis shows that applying a gel containing green tea extract 1 gram/100 mL into the periodontal pocket as an adjunct to scaling improves gingivitis, periodontal disease, and clinical attachment by 7%, 112%, and 116%, respectively, when compared with placebo gel ( 90135 ). A meta-analysis of low-quality clinical research also shows that use of oral or topical products containing green tea modestly improve clinical attachment when compared with control products, including triclosan toothpaste and placebo. Green tea products included gel, paste, and tea ( 107156 ). more Pneumonia. It is unclear if drinking green tea is beneficial for pneumonia prevention. Epidemiological research in Japanese females has found that consuming green tea is associated with a lower risk of death from pneumonia when compared to those who do not drink green tea ( 53897 ). However, other epidemiological research in hospitalized elderly Japanese adults has found that there is no association between green tea consumption during the past month and prevalence of pneumonia at time of hospitalization ( 107161 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for PCOS. A meta-analysis of 4 small clinical trials shows that taking green tea modestly reduces weight in patients with PCOS when compared with placebo. However, there was no effect on other endpoints including body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, or waist or hip circumference. Three studies in the meta-analysis used green tea 1000-2000 mg/daily in tablets or capsules; the other study used green tea powder providing epigallocatechin gallate 1620 mg daily ( 111019 ). However, the included studies were small and utilized heterogeneous dosing regimens. Subsequently, a moderate-sized clinical study in patients with PCOS shows that taking green tea leaf powder, 500 mg twice daily for 1 week followed by 1500 mg daily for 3 months, improves menstrual cycle regularity, but does not reduce BMI or waist or hip circumference, when compared with metformin or placebo ( 114894 ). more Postoperative pain. It is unclear if rinsing the mouth with green tea is beneficial for postoperative pain associated with molar removal. In patients undergoing third molar extraction, a small clinical trial shows that using 15 mL of a mouthwash containing green tea extract 5 grams/100 mL twice daily, beginning the day after surgical removal of impacted molars and continuing for 7 days thereafter, reduces pain by 60% and analgesic use during the first three days when compared with using a mouthwash that does not contain green tea ( 90141 ). more Prostate cancer. It is unclear if drinking green tea or taking green tea catechins by mouth is beneficial for prostate cancer treatment or prevention. Green tea catechins have been evaluated for reducing prostate cancer risk in high-risk patients ( 14127 , 98421 , 102716 ). A meta-analysis of results from three clinical trials shows that taking green tea catechins 400-600 mg daily for 12-30 months reduces the risk of prostate cancer by approximately 62% when compared with placebo in high-risk patients ( 98421 ). However, another meta-analysis including two of these studies plus one additional does not show that taking green tea catechins reduces the incidence of prostate cancer in high-risk patients ( 102716 ). Most population research has found that drinking higher amounts of green tea is not associated with a reduced risk for prostate cancer when compared with those who never or rarely drink green tea ( 14128 , 54036 , 53741 , 53753 , 90153 , 90181 , 98421 ). However, one meta-analysis of population research found that people who drink very high amounts of green tea (7-15 cups daily) have a 19% to 44% reduced risk of prostate cancer ( 98421 ). Another population study found that higher green tea intake is associated with a reduced risk of advanced, but not overall, prostate cancer risk ( 53753 ). In April 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that it would allow a qualified health claim stating that consuming green tea may reduce the risk of prostate cancer, although the FDA has concluded that there is very little scientific evidence to support this claim ( 102106 ). Additionally, most clinical research shows that drinking large amounts of green tea or taking green tea extract does not reduce disease progression in patients with prostate cancer ( 11366 , 53726 ). Green tea and green tea catechins have also been evaluated for reducing prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. A meta-analysis of clinical research in patients with or at risk of prostate cancer shows that taking green tea or green tea extract for 3 weeks to 12 months does not modify PSA levels when compared with water or placebo. However, sub-analyses suggest that there is significant heterogeneity with respect to findings between geographical locations, with some evidence of benefit in studies conducted in the US ( 107155 ). more Radiation dermatitis. It is unclear if topical green tea is beneficial for preventing radiation dermatitis. Preliminary clinical research in patients undergoing radiotherapy after breast cancer surgery shows that spraying epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) over the radiation field prevents the development of at least moderate severity radiation dermatitis by 30% when compared with saline as placebo. Also, occurrence of symptoms was delayed by about 2.7 days and symptom severity was reduced. EGCG 660 mcmol/L was sprayed 3 times daily from the first day of radiation until 2 weeks after completion at 0.05 mL per squared cm ( 111031 ). The interpretation of these results is limited by the unbalanced treatment groups. more Radiation-induced diarrhea. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for reducing diarrhea associated with radiotherapy. A small clinical trial shows that taking a green tea tablet (Camgreen, Iran Giahessence Pharmacy Co.) 450 mg daily for 5 weeks during pelvic irradiation reduces the frequency of diarrhea in patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment. In the fifth week of treatment, 19% of patients taking green tea had diarrhea, compared with approximately 62% of those taking placebo ( 104614 ). more Radiation-induced nausea and vomiting. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for reducing vomiting associated with radiotherapy. A small clinical trial shows that taking a green tea tablet (Camgreen, Iran Giahessence Pharmacy Co.) 450 mg daily for 5 weeks during pelvic irradiation does not reduce the frequency of vomiting when compared with placebo in patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment ( 104614 ). more Renal cell carcinoma. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for preventing kidney cancer. Epidemiological research suggests that green tea intake is not associated with risk of kidney cancer over a mean of 19 years in Japanese adults. However, in females, consuming at least 5 cups of green tea daily, but not lesser amounts, is associated with a 55% reduced risk of kidney cancer when compared with rare intake ( 111022 ). more Skin cancer. Although there has been interest in using oral or topical green tea for skin cancer, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of green tea for this condition. Stress. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for stress reduction. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a specific brand of green tea extract (Teavigo, DSM) 300 mg orally for 7 days reduces stress and increases calmness when compared with placebo in healthy individuals ( 54055 ). more Stretch marks (striae distensae). It is unclear if topical green tea is beneficial for stretch marks. A small clinical study in young adult females shows that applying a green tea extract 3% cream to stretch marks on the leg twice daily for 8 weeks reduces stretch mark severity when compared to baseline ( 114893 ). The validity of this study is limited by the lack of a control group. more Stroke. It is unclear if consumption of green tea is associated with a reduced risk of stroke or with reduced all-cause mortality in patients with a previous stroke. Large-scale population research in Japanese individuals suggests that consuming at least 3-5 cups of green tea daily is associated with a reduced risk of cerebrovascular mortality when compared with drinking less than 1 cup daily. This association appears to be primarily related to a decrease in risk for cerebral infarction or hemorrhage ( 14498 , 54080 , 102002 ). Other population research suggests that drinking 1-3 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 36% reduced odds of stroke when compared with drinking less than 1 cup daily, while drinking 4 or more cups daily has no effect. Also, green tea consumption was not associated with reduced incidence of cerebral hemorrhage or infarction in this study ( 97134 ). Meta-analyses of population research suggest that an increase of 1 cup per day in green tea consumption is associated with a 6% reduced risk of stroke or cerebral hemorrhage ( 102728 , 111021 ). A prospective, observational study also suggests that higher intake of tea, including green and black tea, of at least 2 cups daily is associated with a 16% reduced risk of stroke when compared with not drinking tea. This study also found that drinking 2-3 cups daily of each tea and coffee is associated with a 38% reduced risk of stroke when compared with not drinking tea and coffee. The combination of 0.5-1 cups of coffee and 2-3 cups of tea daily, but not tea alone, was associated with a 50% reduced risk of post-stroke dementia when compared with not drinking tea and coffee ( 107204 ). In patients with a previous stroke, drinking at least 3 cups of green tea daily is associated with a 48% to 62% reduced odds of all-cause mortality over a median of 18.5 years when compared with not drinking green tea ( 107160 ). more Sunburn. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for preventing ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema. A meta-analysis of three small clinical trials shows that taking green tea catechins 540-1402 mg daily for 6 to 12 weeks has a small to moderate protective effect against ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema when compared with placebo, especially at lower doses of ultraviolet radiation. A single topical dose of green tea ingredients may also be beneficial, but data is limited ( 107153 ). more Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for SLE. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking green tea extract 500 mg (containing 22% polyphenols) twice daily for 3 months modestly improves disease activity, general health, and vitality when compared with placebo ( 97136 ). more Tinea pedis. It is unclear if a topical green tea footbath is beneficial for athlete's foot. In bedridden, elderly patients with cognitive deficiency, use of a footbath containing a 0.1% green tea extract for 15 minutes once daily for 12 weeks does not improve symptoms of athlete's foot, but does improve skin condition, when compared with a footbath not containing green tea. The green tea extract Sunphenon BG-3 (Taiyo Kagaku Co. Ltd., Yokkaichi), prepared by dissolving 5 grams of the Sunphenon BG-3 product in 5 liters of water to create a 0.1% green tea solution, was used ( 90151 ). more Tooth extraction. Topical green tea has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small, split-mouth clinical study in patients undergoing third molar extractions shows that applying a gel containing green tea extract 0.5% and hyaluronic acid into the surgical site immediately after extraction and three times daily for 7 days improves some post-operative outcomes, such as reducing exudate or facial edema when compared with placebo ( 114895 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to green tea, hyaluronic acid, or the combination. more Ulcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for ulcerative colitis. Preliminary clinical research in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis shows that taking a specific green tea product (Polyphenon E, Mitsui-Norin) 200 mg or 400 mg twice daily for 8 weeks may increase the number of people who respond to therapy and achieve remission when compared with placebo. After treatment, 10 of 15 patients in the green tea extract group responded to therapy and 8 of 15 patients achieved remission, compared with 0 in the placebo group ( 90140 ). more Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It is unclear if gargling and swallowing green tea is beneficial for reducing URTI symptoms. Preliminary clinical research shows that gargling and swallowing green tea (Morgentau, Ronnefeld KG) 100 mL daily over 4 days is less effective than proprietary labdanum lozenges (CYSTUS052, Dr Pandalis Urheimische Medizin GmbH & Co.) for upper respiratory tract symptoms in patients with URTIs ( 53867 ). more Urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is unclear if oral green tea is beneficial for reducing UTI symptoms. A small clinical study in females with acute uncomplicated cystitis shows that adding green tea 2000 mg daily for 3 days to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole reduces symptoms of cystitis when compared with placebo ( 99799 ). This study is limited by its small size and the lack of information on antibiotic resistance in each treatment group. more Wrinkled skin. It is unclear if oral or topical green tea is beneficial for wrinkles. Some preliminary clinical research shows that taking green tea catechins 175 mg twice daily for two years does not reduce signs of photo-aging of the skin in females with facial photo-aging when compared with placebo ( 53873 ). However, using a combination of topical green tea 10% cream and oral green tea extract 300 mg twice daily for 8 weeks seems to improve skin elasticity in females with moderate photo-aging based on microscopic analysis, although the clinical appearance of the skin does not seem to significantly improve ( 53731 ). Other preliminary clinical research shows that consuming one liter of a beverage with green tea polyphenols for 12 weeks improves skin elasticity, roughness, and hydration in middle-aged females when compared with placebo ( 54030 ). more More evidence is needed to rate green tea for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Likely Safe when green tea is consumed as a beverage in moderate amounts ( 733 , 6031 , 9222 , 9223 , 9225 , 9226 , 9227 , 9228 , 14136 , 90156 )( 90159 , 90168 , 90174 , 90184 , 95696 ). Green tea contains caffeine. According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, drinking up to 8 cups of green tea daily, or approximately 400 mg of caffeine, is not associated with significant adverse cardiovascular, bone, behavioral, or reproductive effects in healthy adults ( 11733 , 98806 ). The US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee states that there is strong and consistent evidence that consumption of caffeine 400 mg daily is not associated with increased risk of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer, in healthy adults ( 98806 ). ...when green tea extract cream or ointment is used topically and appropriately, short-term. A green tea extract 3% cream, applied twice daily, has been used with apparent safety for up to 8 weeks, and a specific green tea extract ointment (Veregen, Bradley Pharmaceuticals) providing 15% kunecatechins has been safely used for up to 16 weeks ( 15067 ). The safety of treatment for longer durations or multiple treatment courses is not known. Possibly Safe when green tea extract is used orally. Green tea extract containing 7% to 12% caffeine has been used safely for up to 2 years ( 8117 , 37725 ). Also decaffeinated green tea extract up to 1.3 grams daily enriched in EGCG has been used safely for up to 12 months ( 90158 , 97131 ). In addition, green tea extract has been safely used as part of an herbal mixture also containing garcinia, coffee, and banaba extracts for 12 weeks ( 90137 ). ...when used topically and appropriately as a cream or mouthwash ( 6065 , 11310 , 90141 , 90150 , 90151 ). Possibly Unsafe when consumed as a beverage in large quantities. Green tea contains a significant amount of caffeine. Chronic use, especially in large amounts, can produce tolerance, habituation, psychological dependence, and other significant adverse effects. Doses of caffeine greater than 600 mg per day, or approximately 12 cups of green tea, have been associated with significant adverse effects such as tachyarrhythmias and sleep disturbances ( 11832 ). These effects would not be expected to occur with the consumption of decaffeinated green tea. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as green tea, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product. There is also some speculation that green tea products containing higher amounts of the catechin epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) might have increased risk of adverse events. Some research has found that taking green tea products containing EGCG levels greater than 200 mg is associated with increased risk of mild adverse effects such as constipation, increased blood pressure, and rash ( 90161 ). Other research has found that doses of EGCG equal to or above 800 mg daily may be associated with increased risk of liver injury in humans ( 95440 , 95696 , 97131 ). Likely Unsafe when used orally in very high doses. The fatal acute oral dose of caffeine is estimated to be 10-14 grams (150-200 mg per kilogram). Serious toxicity can occur at lower doses depending on variables in caffeine sensitivity such as smoking, age, and prior caffeine use ( 11832 ). CHILDREN: Possibly Safe when used orally by children and adolescents in amounts commonly found in foods and beverages ( 4912 , 11833 ). Intake of caffeine in doses of less than 2.5 mg/kg daily is not associated with significant adverse effects in children and adolescents ( 11733 , 98806 ). ...when used for gargling three times daily for up to 90 days ( 90150 ). CHILDREN: There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of green tea extract when used orally in children. However, taking green tea extract orally has been associated with potentially serious, albeit uncommon and unpredictable cases, of hepatotoxicity in adults. Therefore, some experts recommend that children under the age of 18 years of age do not use products containing green tea extract ( 94897 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Safe when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of green tea, pregnant patients should closely monitor their intake to ensure moderate consumption. Fetal blood concentrations of caffeine approximate maternal concentrations ( 4260 ). The use of caffeine during pregnancy is controversial; however, moderate consumption has not been associated with clinically important adverse fetal effects ( 2708 , 2709 , 2710 , 2711 , 9606 , 11733 , 16014 , 16015 , 98806 ). In some studies consuming amounts over 200 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage ( 16014 ). This increased risk may be most likely to occur in those with genotypes that confer a slow rate of caffeine metabolism ( 98806 ). According to a review by Health Canada, and a subsequent large meta-analysis conducted in the US, most healthy pregnant patients can safely consume doses up to 300 mg daily without an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, fetal growth retardation, or congenital malformations ( 11733 , 98806 ). Advise keeping caffeine consumption below 300 mg daily. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 6 cups of green tea. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as green tea, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product. Based on animal models, green tea extract catechins are also transferred to the fetus, but in amounts 50-100 times less than maternal concentrations ( 15010 ). The potential impact of these catechins on the human fetus is not known, but animal models suggest that the catechins are not teratogenic ( 15011 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in amounts providing more than 300 mg caffeine daily. Caffeine from green tea crosses the placenta, producing fetal blood concentrations similar to maternal levels ( 4260 ). Consumption of caffeine in amounts over 300 mg daily is associated with a significantly increased risk of miscarriage in some studies ( 16014 , 98806 ). Advise keeping caffeine consumption from all sources below 300 mg daily. This is similar to the amount of caffeine in about 6 cups of green tea. High maternal doses of caffeine throughout pregnancy have also resulted in symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborn infants ( 9891 ). High doses of caffeine have also been associated with spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight ( 2709 , 2711 ). However, some research has also found that intrauterine exposure to even modest amounts of caffeine, based on maternal blood levels during the first trimester, is associated with a shorter stature in children ages 4-8 years ( 109846 ). Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. The amount of caffeine found in ingredients such as green tea, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product. PREGNANCY: There is also concern that consuming large amounts of green tea might have antifolate activity and potentially increase the risk of folic acid deficiency-related birth defects. Catechins in green tea inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase in vitro ( 15012 ). This enzyme is responsible for converting folic acid to its active form. Preliminary evidence suggests that increasing maternal green tea consumption is associated with increased risk of spina bifida ( 15068 ). Also, evidence from epidemiological research suggests that serum folate levels in pregnant patients with high green tea intake (57.3 mL per 1000 kcal) are decreased compared to participants who consume moderate or low amounts of green tea ( 90171 ). More evidence is needed to determine the safety of using green tea during pregnancy. For now, advise pregnant patients to avoid consuming large quantities of green tea. LACTATION: Possibly Safe when used orally in moderate amounts. Due to the caffeine content of green tea, nursing parents should closely monitor caffeine intake. Breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be approximately 50% of maternal serum concentrations ( 9892 ). LACTATION: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in large amounts. Consumption of green tea might cause irritability and increased bowel activity in nursing infants ( 6026 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of green tea extracts when applied topically during breast-feeding.",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: Green tea has most often been used as a beverage, a powder, or an extract. Doses of green tea generally provide up to 2500 mg catechins or 700 mg of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) daily. Isolated catechins have also been used. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Green tea extract and beverages are often standardized to total catechin or EGCG content. Green tea beverages are typically standardized to contain 178-823 mg of total catechins per cup ( 53987 , 53994 , 53995 , 54030 , 90156 , 90168 , 90174 , 90175 , 90184 ). Green tea extracts are typically standardized to contain about 85% to 95% or 400-450 mg of total catechins per capsule ( 53994 , 53995 , 54035 , 54039 , 90139 , 90140 , 90145 ). They are also sometimes standardized to 15% to 97% EGCG ( 54039 , 54055 , 90137 , 90145 , 90158 ). While rare, some research suggests that green tea extracts are associated with hepatotoxicity. To minimize this risk, green tea extracts should be taken with food ( 102722 ). Drinking green tea may reduce the absorption of iron from plant foods ( 631 , 8110 , 9237 , 111644 ). While this interaction is unlikely to be clinically meaningful in most individuals, advise patients with low iron stores to separate intake of green tea from meals. Additionally, certain foods may reduce the absorption of active green tea constituents. Some clinical evidence suggests that consuming green tea extract in conjunction with soy protein reduces catechin bioavailability ( 90957 ). Advise patients to separate dosing of green tea and soy protein products by at least 3 hours. There is also some concern that milk may reduce the absorption of green tea polyphenols ( 220 , 6032 , 15219 , 36557 , 36594 ). However, this interaction is unlikely to be clinically significant. Topical: Topically, green tea has been used in a solution, footbath, ointment, or gel. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Children Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Standardization & Formulation Various green tea products and extracts have been examined in clinical trials. Green tea, green tea beverages, and green tea extracts are typically standardized to polyphenol or total catechin content. The commonly used dose of green tea, which is about 3 cups per day, provides 240-480 mg of polyphenols ( 53867 ). Green teas used in clinical research have been standardized to contain 178-823 mg of total catechins per cup ( 53994 , 53995 , 90156 , 90168 , 90174 , 90184 ). Green tea-containing beverages used in clinical research have been standardized to contain about 400 mg of total catechins per cup of green tea beverage ( 53987 , 54030 ), or 302 mg of EGCG per cup ( 90175 ). Supplements containing green tea extract have been standardized to contain about 400-450 mg of total catechins per capsule ( 53994 , 53995 , 54035 , 54039 ). One product contained 187.5 mg polyphenols, 125 mg EGCG, and 20 mg caffeine per 250 mg extract ( 98420 ). A specific decaffeinated green tea extract supplement (Teavigo, DSM) has been standardized to contain 94% to 97% EGCG ( 54055 , 90158 ). A green tea footbath used in a clinical trial was made using a specific green tea extract Sunphenon BG-3 (Taiyo Kagaku Co. Ltd.), which was standardized to a total catechin content 89.1% with an EGCG content of 48.8% and an epigallocatechin (EGC) content of 17.8%. The footbath was prepared by dissolving 5 grams of Sunphenon BG-3 in 15 mL glycerin, then diluting the solution in 5 liters of water to create a 0.1% green tea solution ( 90151 ). A specific green tea extract (Polyphenon E), has been used in various clinical trials ( 90139 , 90140 , 90145 ). Polyphenon E contains 85% to 95% total catechins, with 56% to 72% as EGCG. Capsules are standardized to contain 200 mg of EGCG per capsule ( 90145 ). A specific product (Herbal One Green Tea Extract, Herbal One Co., Ltd.) containing 250 mg of green tea extract per capsule has been standardized to contain gallic acid 0.24 mg, catechin 4.09 mg, caffeine 28.86 mg, EGCG 33.58 mg, and epicatechin gallate 9.28 mg ( 37725 ). A specific decaffeinated green tea extract product (Sunphenon 90LB, Taiyo Kagaku Ltd) containing decaffeinated green tea extract 530 mg per capsule has been standardized to contain EGCG 40.71%, epigallocatechin (EGC) 16.27%, epicatechin 8.74%, epicatechin gallate 6.02%, gallocatechin 2.02%, gallocatechin gallate 1.27%, catechin 1.16%, gallic acid 0.75%, and catechin gallate 0.03% ( 54039 ). One type of green tea extract (Thea-Flan 90S, ITO EN Ltd.) provided catechin 336.4 mg and caffeine 2.7 mg per three capsules. The catechins included EGCG 216.9 mg, epicatechin gallate 96.4 mg, epigallocatechin 3.2 mg, epicatechin 1.7 mg, gallocatechin gallate 12.5 mg, catechin gallate 4.0 mg, gallocatechin 1.0 mg, and catechin 0.8 mg ( 104603 ).",
  "interactions_text": "Expand All | Collapse All 5-FLUOROURACIL Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, high doses of green tea might increase the effects and side effects of 5-fluorouracil. Animal research shows that taking green tea in amounts equivalent to about 6 cups daily in humans for 4 weeks prior to receiving a single injection of 5-fluorouracil increases the maximum plasma levels of 5-fluorouracil by about 2.5-fold and the area under the curve by 425% ( 98424 ). more ADENOSINE (Adenocard) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, green tea might decrease the vasodilatory effects of adenosine and interfere with its use prior to stress testing. Green tea contains caffeine. Caffeine is a competitive inhibitor of adenosine at the cellular level. However, caffeine doesn't seem to affect supplemental adenosine because high interstitial levels of adenosine overcome the antagonistic effects of caffeine ( 11771 ). It is recommended that methylxanthines and methylxanthine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests ( 11770 ). However, methylxanthines appear more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine-induced stress testing ( 11771 ). more ALCOHOL (Ethanol) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, alcohol might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Concomitant use of alcohol and caffeine can increase caffeine serum concentrations and the risk of caffeine adverse effects. Alcohol reduces caffeine metabolism ( 6370 ). more ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea may increase the risk of bleeding if used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. Conflicting reports exist regarding the effect of green tea on bleeding risk when used with anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs; however, most evidence suggests that drinking green tea in moderate amounts is unlikely to cause a significant interaction. Green tea contains small amounts of vitamin K, approximately 7 mcg per cup ( 100524 ). Some case reports have associated the antagonism of warfarin with the vitamin K content of green tea ( 1460 , 1461 , 1463 , 4211 , 6048 , 8028 , 20868 ). However, these reports are rare, and very large doses of green tea (about 8-16 cups daily) appear to be needed to cause these effects. Furthermore, the catechins and caffeine in green tea are reported to have antiplatelet activity ( 733 , 8028 , 8029 , 12882 , 100524 ). more ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, taking green tea with antidiabetes drugs might interfere with blood glucose control. Concomitant use of green tea and antidiabetes drugs might interfere with blood glucose control. The data are conflicting. Reports claim that green tea and/or caffeine, a constituent of green tea, might increase or decrease blood sugar ( 6024 , 8646 , 54011 , 54035 , 54068 , 90154 ). more ATORVASTATIN (Lipitor) Interaction Rating Major Do not take this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence LIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Green tea extract seems to reduce the levels and clinical effects of atorvastatin. In healthy humans, taking green tea extract 300 mg or 600 mg along with atorvastatin reduces plasma levels of atorvastatin by approximately 24%. The elimination of atorvastatin is not affected ( 102714 ). Atorvastatin is a substrate of organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs). Research shows that two of the major catechins found in green tea, epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), inhibit OATPs. Some OATPs are expressed in the small intestine and are responsible for the uptake of drugs and other compounds, which may have resulted in reduced plasma levels of atorvastatin ( 19079 ). It is not clear if drinking green tea alters the absorption of atorvastatin. more BETA-ADRENERGIC AGONISTS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Green tea contains caffeine. Theoretically, concomitant use of large amounts of caffeine might increase cardiac inotropic effects of beta-agonists ( 15 ). BORTEZOMIB (Velcade) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might interfere with the effects of bortezomib. In vitro research shows that green tea polyphenols, such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), interact with bortezomib and block its proteasome inhibitory action. This prevents the induction of cell death in multiple myeloma or glioblastoma cancer cell lines ( 17212 ). Advise patients taking bortezomib, not to take green tea. more CARBAMAZEPINE (Tegretol) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the effects of carbamazepine and increase the risk for convulsions. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that taking caffeine can lower the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine and can induce seizures when taken in doses above 400 mg/kg ( 23559 , 23561 ). Human research has shown that taking caffeine 300 mg in three divided doses along with carbamazepine 200 mg reduces the bioavailability of carbamazepine by 32% and prolongs the plasma half-life of carbamazepine 2-fold in healthy individuals ( 23562 ). more CELIPROLOL (Celicard) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the levels and clinical effects of celiprolol. In a small human study, taking green tea daily for 4 days appears to decrease blood and urine levels of celiprolol by at least 98% ( 104607 ). This interaction is possibly due to the inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP). Green tea catechins have been shown to inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP), one of which, OATP1A2, is found in the intestine ( 19079 , 19080 , 98461 ) The interaction is thought to be due primarily to the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) content of green tea ( 98461 ). more CIMETIDINE (Tagamet) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence LIKELY Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the effects and adverse effects of caffeine in green tea. Green tea contains caffeine. Cimetidine can reduce caffeine clearance by 31% to 42% ( 11736 ). more CLOZAPINE (Clozaril) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, green tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of clozapine and acutely exacerbate psychotic symptoms. Animal research suggests that, although green tea extract does not affect the elimination of clozapine, it delays the time to reach peak concentration and reduces the peak plasma levels ( 90173 ). Also, concomitant administration of green tea and clozapine might theoretically cause acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms due to the caffeine in green tea. Caffeine can increase the effects and toxicity of clozapine. Caffeine doses of 400-1000 mg daily inhibit clozapine metabolism ( 5051 ). Clozapine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). Researchers speculate that caffeine might inhibit CYP1A2. However, there is no reliable evidence that caffeine affects CYP1A2. There is also speculation that genetic factors might make some patients be more sensitive to the interaction between clozapine and caffeine ( 13741 ). more CONTRACEPTIVE DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the effects and adverse effects of caffeine found in green tea. Green tea contains caffeine. Oral contraceptives can decrease caffeine clearance by 40% to 65% ( 8644 ). more CYTOCHROME P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) INHIBITORS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Caffeine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) ( 3941 , 5051 , 11741 , 23557 , 23573 , 23580 , 24958 , 24959 , 24960 , 24962 ), ( 24964 , 24965 , 24967 , 24968 , 24969 , 24971 , 38081 , 48603 ). Theoretically, drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 may decrease the clearance rate of caffeine from green tea and increase caffeine levels. more CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Green tea is unlikely to produce clinically significant changes in the levels and clinical effects of CYP3A4 substrates. In vitro and in vivo research suggests that green tea can inhibit intestinal CYP3A and induce hepatic CYP3A4 enzymes ( 20896 , 53747 , 53835 , 90170 ). However, this effect is unlikely to be clinically significant, as green tea does not appear to affect CYP3A4 activity in humans ( 14429 , 90170 ). more DIPYRIDAMOLE (Persantine) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, green tea might decrease the vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole and interfere with its use prior to stress testing. Green tea contains caffeine. Caffeine might inhibit dipyridamole-induced vasodilation ( 11770 , 11772 ). It is recommended that methylxanthines and methylxanthine-containing products be stopped 24 hours prior to pharmacological stress tests ( 11770 ). Methylxanthines appear more likely to interfere with dipyridamole (Persantine) than adenosine-induced stress testing ( 11771 ). more DISULFIRAM (Antabuse) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, disulfiram might increase the risk of adverse effects from caffeine. In human research, disulfiram decreases the clearance and increases the half-life of caffeine ( 11840 ). more DIURETIC DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, using green tea with diuretic drugs might increase the risk of hypokalemia. Green tea contains caffeine. In excessive amounts, caffeine can reduce potassium levels due to stimulation of the sodium-potassium pump ( 23579 , 37905 , 37953 , 38003 , 38034 ). Diuretics can also cause lower potassium levels. more EPHEDRINE Interaction Rating Major Do not take this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the risk for stimulant adverse effects. Green tea contains caffeine. There is evidence that using ephedrine with caffeine might increase the risk of serious life-threatening or debilitating adverse effects such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, seizures, and death ( 6486 , 10307 ). more ESTROGENS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, estrogens might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Estrogen inhibits caffeine metabolism ( 2714 ). more ETHOSUXIMIDE (Zarontin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the effects of ethosuximide and increase the risk for convulsions. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that caffeine 92.4 mg/kg can decrease the anticonvulsant activity of ethosuximide ( 23560 ). However, this effect has not been reported in humans. more FELBAMATE (Felbatol) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the effects of felbamate and increase the risk for convulsions. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that a high dose of caffeine 161.7 mg/kg can decreases the anticonvulsant activity of felbamate ( 23563 ). However, this effect has not been reported in humans. more FEXOFENADINE (Allegra) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Green tea can decrease blood levels of fexofenadine. Clinical research shows that green tea can significantly decrease blood levels and excretion of fexofenadine. Taking green tea extract with a dose of fexofenadine decreased bioavailability of fexofenadine by about 30%. In vitro, green tea inhibits the cellular accumulation of fexofenadine by inhibiting the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) drug transporter ( 111029 ). Research shows that two of the major catechins found in green tea, epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), inhibit OATPs, specifically OATP1A2, OATP1B1, and OATP2B1. In addition, green tea has been shown to reduce the absorption of some drugs that are OATP substrates ( 19079 , 102714 , 102730 ). more FLUCONAZOLE (Diflucan) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination.

Severity HIGH Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, concomitant use might have additive adverse hepatotoxic effects. Green tea extract supplements have been linked to several cases of hepatotoxicity and might have additive hepatotoxic effects with other drugs. ( 14136 , 14310 , 53740 , 53742 , 53746 , 53752 , 53775 , 54016 , 15026 , 54027 )( 93256 , 102722 , 111644 ). more IMATINIB (Gleevec) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the levels and clinical effects of imatinib. In animal research, a single dose of green tea extract reduces the area under the curve (AUC) of imatinib by up to approximately 64% and its main metabolite N-desmethyl imatinib by up to approximately 81% ( 104600 ). This interaction has not been shown in humans. The mechanism of action is unclear but may involve multiple pathways. more LISINOPRIL Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Case-control study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the levels and clinical effects of lisinopril. Preliminary clinical research shows that a single dose of green tea extract reduces plasma concentrations of lisinopril. Compared to a control group, peak levels and area under the curve (AUC) of lisinopril were reduced by approximately 71% and 66%, respectively ( 104599 ). This may be due to inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) by green tea catechins ( 19079 , 19080 , 98461 ) The interaction is thought to be due primarily to the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) content of green tea ( 98461 ). more LITHIUM Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, abrupt green tea withdrawal might increase the levels and adverse effects of lithium.

Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of midazolam. Animal research suggests that green tea extract can increase the maximum plasma concentration, but not the half-life, of oral midazolam. This effect has been attributed to the inhibition of intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and induction of hepatic CYP3A4 enzymes by green tea constituents ( 20896 ). However, it is unlikely that this effect is clinically significant, as the dose used in animals was 50 times greater than what is commonly ingested by humans. more MONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITORS (MAOIs) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the risk of a hypertensive crisis. Green tea contains caffeine. Caffeine has been shown to inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B in laboratory studies ( 37724 , 37877 , 37912 , 38108 ). Concomitant intake of large amounts of caffeine with MAOIs might precipitate a hypertensive crisis ( 15 ). In a case report, a patient that consumed 10-12 cups of caffeinated coffee and took the MAOI tranylcypromine presented with severe hypertension ( 91086 ). Hypertension was resolved after the patient switched to drinking decaffeinated coffee. more NADOLOL (Corgard) Interaction Rating Major Do not take this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence LIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Green tea seems to reduce the levels and clinical effects of nadolol. Preliminary clinical research shows that green tea consumption reduces plasma concentrations of nadolol. Compared to a control group, both peak levels and total drug exposure (AUC) of nadolol were reduced by approximately 85% in subjects who drank green tea daily for two weeks. Drinking green tea with nadolol also significantly reduced nadolol's systolic blood pressure lowering effect ( 19071 ). Other clinical research shows that a single dose of green tea can affect plasma nadolol levels for at least one hour ( 102721 ). Green tea catechins have been shown to inhibit organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP), one of which, OATP1A2, is involved in the uptake of nadolol in the intestine ( 19071 , 19079 , 19080 , 98461 ) The interaction is thought to be due primarily to the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) content of green tea ( 98461 ). more NICARDIPINE (Cardene) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might increase the levels and adverse effects of nicardipine. Green tea contains EGCG. Animal research shows that EGCG increases the area under the curve (AUC) and absolute oral bioavailability of nicardipine. The mechanism of action is thought to involve inhibition of both intestinal P-glycoprotein and hepatic cytochrome P450 3A ( 90136 ). The effect of green tea itself on nicardipine is unclear. more NICOTINE Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the risk of hypertension. Green tea contains caffeine.

Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea might reduce the effects of phenobarbital and increase the risk for convulsions. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that caffeine can decrease the anticonvulsant activity of phenobarbital ( 23558 , 23559 , 23561 ). The exact mechanism of this interaction is unclear. more PHENOTHIAZINES Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination.

The effect does not seem to be related to the seizure threshold-lowering effects of caffeine. However, the exact mechanism of this interaction is unclear. more PIOGLITAZONE (Actos) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, green tea might increase the levels and clinical effects of pioglitazone. Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that caffeine can modestly increase the maximum concentration, area under the curve, and half-life of pioglitazone, and also reduce its clearance. This increased the antidiabetic effects of pioglitazone ( 108812 ). However, the exact mechanism of this interaction is unclear. more QUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Theoretically, quinolone antibiotics might increase the levels and adverse effects of caffeine. Green tea contains caffeine. Quinolones (also called fluoroquinolones) can decrease caffeine clearance by inhibiting cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) enzyme ( 606 , 607 , 608 , 23554 , 23555 , 23556 ). more RILUZOLE (Rilutek) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the levels and adverse effects of both caffeine and riluzole. Green tea contains caffeine. Caffeine and riluzole are both metabolized by cytochrome P450 1A2, and concomitant use might reduce metabolism of one or both agents ( 11739 ). more ROSUVASTATIN (Crestor) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Theoretically, green tea extract might alter the absorption and distribution of rosuvastatin. In animal research, giving green tea extract with rosuvastatin increased plasma levels of rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin is a substrate of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, which is expressed in the liver. The increased plasma levels may have been related to inhibition of OATP1B1 ( 102717 ). However, in humans, taking EGCG with rosuvastatin reduced plasma levels of rosuvastatin, suggesting an inhibition of intestinal OATP ( 102730 ). It is not clear if drinking green tea alters the absorption of rosuvastatin. more STIMULANT DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence C (Expert opinion) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase stimulant adverse effects. Green tea contains caffeine. Due to the central nervous system (CNS) stimulant effects of caffeine, concomitant use with stimulant drugs can increase the risk of adverse effects ( 11832 ). more TERBINAFINE (Lamisil) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination.

Green tea contains caffeine. Animal research suggests that caffeine can decrease the anticonvulsant activity of valproate ( 23558 , 23559 , 23561 , 37882 ). However, the exact mechanism of this interaction is unclear. more VERAPAMIL (Calan, others) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Theoretically, concomitant use might increase the levels and adverse effects of both verapamil and caffeine. Animal research suggests that the green tea constituent EGCG increases the area under the curve (AUC) values for verapamil by up to 111% and its metabolite norverapamil by up to 87%, likely by inhibiting P-glycoprotein ( 90138 ). Also, theoretically, concomitant use of verapamil and caffeinated beverages such as green tea might increase plasma caffeine concentrations and the risk of adverse effects, due to the caffeine contained in green tea. Verapamil increases plasma caffeine concentrations by 25% ( 11741 ). more WARFARIN (Coumadin) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Theoretically, green tea may increase the risk of bleeding if used with warfarin. Conflicting reports exist regarding the potential of green tea to antagonize the effect of warfarin; however, most evidence suggests that drinking green tea in moderation is unlikely to cause a significant interaction. Green tea contains a small amount of vitamin K, approximately 7 mcg per cup ( 100524 ). Some case reports have associated the antagonism of warfarin with the vitamin K content of green tea ( 1460 , 1461 , 1463 , 4211 , 6048 , 8028 , 20868 ). However, these reports are rare, and very large doses of green tea (about 8-16 cups daily) appear to be needed to cause these effects ( 1460 , 1461 , 1463 , 8028 ). Therefore, use of green tea in moderate amounts is unlikely to antagonize the effects of warfarin; however, very large doses should be avoided. more",
  "mechanism_text": "General The applicable parts of green tea are the leaf bud, leaf, and stem. Green tea is different than black and oolong teas because it is not fermented. Black tea is fully fermented, and oolong tea is partially fermented. Green tea is produced by steaming fresh leaves at high temperatures. This process inactivates certain oxidizing enzymes, but doesn't decrease polyphenols. Polyphenols such as flavanols, flavandiols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids are abundant in green tea. Flavanols, including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epicatechin (EC), are all referred to as catechins. These seem to be responsible for many of the proposed benefits of green tea. EGCG makes up 50% to 60% of green tea catechins ( 6031 , 8118 , 11310 , 90170 , 90172 , 102721 ). Flavonoids include kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin ( 90170 ). The amount of polyphenols and catechins in green tea is affected by growing conditions, leaf age, and storage during and after transport. Catechins in green tea range from 69 to 103 mg/gram of tea ( 14129 , 14130 ). Green tea also contains phytoestrogens, including beta-sitosterol and the lignan precursors matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol, as well as xanthenes ( 13190 , 90170 ). Green tea also contains 2% to 4% caffeine ( 519 ) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup ( 4218 ). Another constituent of green tea leaves is the amino acid, L-theanine ( 90170 , 90189 ). Unlike fermented teas such as black and oolong teas, green tea does not contain theaflavins, pigments that are produced during the fermentation process ( 15656 ). Anti-acne effects In clinical research, topical application of green tea extract has been shown to have anti-acne effects. Possible mechanisms of action include antimicrobial effects against Propionibacterium acnes, as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of its constituents ( 104609 ). Anti-arthritis effects Although evidence in humans is lacking, EGCG and other catechins in green tea might reduce inflammation and protect cartilage by inhibiting proteoglycan and collagen breakdown ( 12486 ). Green tea polyphenols seem to lessen joint degeneration in laboratory models of rheumatoid arthritis ( 12487 ). In vitro, in articular chondrocytes, EGCG decreased the production and activity of inflammatory cytokines and production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 ( 12485 , 36387 , 36392 , 36402 , 53868 ). Green tea catechins may also inhibit cartilage protein degradation in vitro ( 36377 ), as well as reduce the activity of inflammatory mediators in arthritic joints of animal models ( 12487 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Catechins in green tea might have anti-inflammatory activity. Catechins derived from green tea are a laboratory standard for COX-1 inhibition ( 12849 ). Catechins from green tea also might inhibit the production of leukotriene-B4 and the activity of 5-lipoxygenase ( 12850 ). EGCG inhibits interleukin (IL)-1 beta-induced COX-2 and nitric oxide synthase activity ( 12485 ). EGCG and other catechins in green tea might also reduce inflammation and protect cartilage by inhibiting proteoglycan and collagen breakdown ( 12486 ). The anti-inflammatory activities of catechins may be due to their suppression of migration and suppressed activity of inflammatory cells, possibly in a manner related to cytokine inhibition as shown in vitro ( 53794 , 53832 ) or by inhibiting proteins promoting chemotaxis of these cells ( 53941 ). In human research, however, the effects of green tea or its constituents on inflammatory mediators are unclear. In some studies, the effects of green tea on all measured inflammatory mediators in the blood were lacking, including C-reactive protein (CRP), adiponectin, IL-6, IL-1beta, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), and leptin ( 53730 , 53995 ). However, in other studies, green tea reduced levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, sVCAM-1, and/or CRP ( 53730 , 54012 , 54068 , 104606 ). A meta-analysis of the available clinical research shows that green tea increases IL-6 levels, decreases TNF-alpha levels, and does not affect CRP levels ( 102003 ). Anticancer effects Green tea may protect against some kinds of cancer. Polyphenols in tea appear to have antimutagenic effects and may protect DNA ( 12523 ). In humans, green tea reduces DNA damage in lymphocytes, possibly by increasing the activity of the DNA repair enzyme human oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) and the antioxidant enzyme, heme oxygenase-1 ( 90148 ). Preliminary animal research suggests EGCG might prevent new blood vessel growth (angiogenesis) in tumors. EGCG may also inhibit tumor cell proliferation, causing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis ( 1454 , 1455 , 1456 , 8117 , 11309 , 15662 , 36419 , 54042 ). ECG appears to induce apoptosis in cancer cells by reactive oxygen species formation and mitochondrial depolarization ( 8118 , 53937 , 53971 ). Green tea may also reduce oxidative DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and free radical generation ( 4212 ). Green tea may also reduce mutagenic activity in smokers ( 4217 , 53710 , 53715 , 54083 ). Green tea is thought to be beneficial for preventing skin damage and cancer from ultraviolet (UV) radiation due to the antioxidant effects of polyphenols in green tea. In animal models of skin cancer, applying green tea polyphenols topically reduces progression of skin papillomas to squamous cell carcinoma ( 15066 , 15068 ). Polyphenolic extracts of green tea, specifically EGCG and epicatechin-3-gallate, seem to produce dose-dependent topical protection against UVA and UVB sunburn. Areas of skin where green tea extracts were applied had fewer sunburned cells and less damage to epidermal Langerhans cells, which are responsible for cutaneous immune response. Green tea extracts also seem to prevent UV radiation-induced DNA damage ( 1359 ) and apoptotic keratinocytes ( 53787 ). Animal models indicate that green tea extracts reduce oxidative skin damage, skin inflammation, and epidermal hyperplasia due to UV radiation and other causes ( 6065 ). Unlike conventional sunscreens, green tea extracts do not absorb significant amounts of light in the UV range ( 1359 ). Green tea polyphenols also appear to have activity against human papilloma virus (HPV)-related cervical dysplasia and genital and perianal warts (Condylomata acuminata) ( 11310 , 15067 ); however, the mechanism of action is not known. In adults with high-risk oral premalignant lesions, green tea extract downregulated stromal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cyclin D1 expression which was associated with clinical suppression of oral premalignant lesions ( 53936 ). Some evidence suggests that green tea may enhance the anticancer effects of some chemotherapeutic agents. There is preliminary in vitro and xenograft evidence that green tea might enhance the effects of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) on tumor cells ( 3940 , 90152 , 90157 , 90165 , 90182 ). The caffeine, theanine, and EGCG constituents appear to increase the concentration of doxorubicin inside tumor cells by inhibiting the efflux mechanisms that remove doxorubicin from the cell ( 7690 , 90152 , 90157 , 90165 ). Also, in vitro evidence suggests that EGCG increases apoptosis induced by gemcitabine ( 53843 ). Also, in a tamoxifen-resistant cell line in vitro, EGCG reduced the activity of the proteins, P-glycoprotein and the Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), which play a role in drug metabolism and transport ( 90142 ). EGCG from green tea is structurally similar to methotrexate and aminopterin and also appears to inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. This antifolate activity results in inhibition of lymphoma cell growth and apoptosis in vitro ( 15012 ). In vitro, EGCG inhibited the proteolytic enzyme urokinase, which is involved in tumor invasion and metastasis ( 53732 , 54099 ). EGCG has also been shown to downregulate the laminin receptor, involved in cell differentiation, migration, and adhesion ( 53913 ) and inhibits the migration and invasion of some cell lines ( 53862 ). The inhibition of the metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) by EGCG and green tea may also play a role in the inhibition of migration of cancer cells ( 53997 ). Antiproliferative effects of EGCG may be modulated through the upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor-2 (Nrf2) expression and increases in uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase-1A (UGT1A) levels in vitro and in animal models ( 53908 ). In pancreatic cells in vitro, proliferation was inhibited by EGCG by a mechanism involving the inhibition of the focal adhesion kinase and the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor ( 54020 ). Anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects There is some evidence green tea suppresses thromboxane formation during blood clotting by inhibiting the release of arachidonic acid from platelets ( 8028 , 12882 , 54067 , 54078 ). Antidiabetic effects Caffeine has been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose. In people with type 2 diabetes, acute administration of caffeine impairs postprandial glucose metabolism, while acute abstention from caffeine reduces postprandial glucose levels by 21%. Whether these effects also occur with caffeinated beverages and herbs is unknown ( 12374 ). Other research in obese people suggests that caffeine ingestion may contribute to insulin resistance ( 12375 , 13744 ). However, one study found that patients with type 1 diabetes taking 200 mg of caffeine twice daily had increased frequency and intensity of warning signs of hypoglycemia. This may be due to a reduction in blood flow to the brain and an increase in glucose utilization by the brain ( 6024 ). Some clinical research suggests symptoms of hypoglycemia are more intense at onset in the absence of caffeine, but with increasing duration of hypoglycemia, symptoms are greater with caffeine ( 13740 ). Green tea itself has also been reported to cause increases and decreases in blood glucose, or no effect, in human research. However, a meta-analysis of numerous clinical trials suggests that there is a decrease in blood glucose when individuals with diabetes, prediabetes, and normal glucose levels are combined ( 54011 , 54035 , 54056 , 54068 , 90154 ). In addition, taking green tea reduces postprandial glucose levels at an evening meal, but not a morning meal, possibly by reducing levels of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( 102724 ). In animal diabetic models, green tea extract and EGCG decreased blood glucose ( 3922 , 53749 ). Antidiarrheal effects Tannins in green tea can produce antidiarrheal effects. The polyphenols in green tea might increase the level of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria and reduce the population of enterobacteria ( 3941 ). Antilipemic effects In human research, green tea taken orally seems to lower total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol ( 11308 , 54038 , 54048 , 90146 , 90161 ). Some of this research also suggests green tea may lower triglycerides and increase levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. In animal research, green tea also resulted in a decrease in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels ( 53890 , 54101 ). Possible mechanisms of action may involve the inhibition of ileal apical sodium bile acid transporter (ASBT) activity as shown by EGCG in vitro ( 53958 ). Antioxidant effects The antioxidant effects of green tea and its constituent catechins are thought to explain some of its clinical effects, especially related to its anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, and cardiovascular benefits. In human research, green tea and its catechins have been shown to protect against the oxidative damage caused by exercise ( 53766 , 54053 ) and smoking ( 4212 , 53791 ), as well as general oxidative exposure ( 53734 , 53989 , 53994 , 54068 , 54117 , 90168 ). One meta-analysis of clinical trials shows that green tea increases total antioxidant capacity but does not reduce levels of malondialdehyde. However, no antioxidant effects were identified in a meta-analysis of research on individuals with obesity ( 107157 ) or in a clinical trial on individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ( 114894 ). The antioxidant effects of green tea and its constituents may relate to their ability to scavenge free radicals, chelate redox active transition-metal ions, inhibit redox active transcription factors, inhibit pro-oxidant enzymes, and induce antioxidant enzymes ( 53750 , 53772 , 53794 , 53817 , 53837 , 53912 , 53960 , 90172 , 90174 ). However, some studies in humans have not shown these antioxidant benefits ( 9230 , 36583 , 36592 , 53734 , 53735 ). Antiviral effects In vitro, the catechins in green tea have shown activity against HIV replication, although less so than black tea, which contains theaflavins ( 15658 ). In vitro, the green tea constituent EGCG has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 infectivity of human T cells and macrophages, as well as antigen production, by a mechanism not involving cytotoxicity, cell growth inhibition, or apoptosis ( 53840 ). EGCG has also been shown to inhibit the activity of and degrade the semen-derived enhancer of virus infection (SEVI), possibly leading to decreased semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection ( 53871 ). Tea polyphenols are also nonspecifically effective against both influenza A and B viruses; the polyphenols bind to the hemagglutinin of influenza virus, inhibiting absorption and entry into cells ( 36544 ). In vitro, EGCG inhibited infection of kidney cells by rotaviruses and enteroviruses, in a manner involving interference with virus adsorption ( 36417 ). In vitro, green tea extract decreased the efficiency of the vaccinia virus ( 53965 ). Although there is little information in humans, green tea capsules resulted in a reduced human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) in HTLV-1 carriers ( 53717 ). Blood pressure effects There is contradictory evidence about tea consumption and hypertension. Some population research suggests drinking green tea reduces the risk of developing hypertension ( 12518 ). Also, some clinical research suggests that taking green tea extract reduces blood pressure in patients with or without hypertension ( 54068 , 90146 , 90155 , 90159 , 90161 ). However, other clinical and epidemiological studies on normotensive and hypertensive patients show that green tea or black tea has no effect on blood pressure ( 1452 , 15655 , 54080 ). Furthermore, increases in blood pressure have been shown in some studies ( 54014 , 54065 ). Also, caffeine, found in green tea, can acutely elevate both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, although caffeine may not have this effect in habitual users ( 2722 ). In animal research, green tea extracts prevented angiotensin-induced increases in blood pressure and heart tissue damage, possibly via the prevention of hydrogen peroxide radicals ( 53757 , 53798 ). Bone effects Epidemiological research suggests that drinking green tea for at least ten years increases bone mineral density. The exact mechanism for the effects on bone is unknown, but several possibilities have been suggested. Tea leaves contain fluoride, which might slow osteoporosis. Tea also contains flavonoids and phytoestrogens, which might affect bone mineral density. Other proposed mechanisms include inhibition of bone resorption and effects on mineral metabolism by polyphenols and tannins ( 8116 ). Green tea extract is also of interest for modulating facial development in children with Down syndrome. Animal research suggests that green tea extract beneficially alters craniofacial skeletons; however, high doses had negative effects ( 107167 ). Cardiovascular effects The cardiovascular effects of green tea may be related to its constituent polyphenols and/or caffeine. Green tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine ( 519 ) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup ( 4218 ). The caffeine in green tea stimulates the heart and possibly the pressor centers that control blood pressure ( 2722 ). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition ( 2722 ). By blocking adenosine receptors, caffeine is thought to increase the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine ( 6370 ). Caffeine can have positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart ( 11836 ). Some preliminary studies show that flavonoids found in green tea might reduce lipoprotein oxidation ( 6032 , 6033 , 9232 ). In vitro tests indicate that catechins in green tea reduce proliferation of vascular smooth muscle that occurs with high concentrations of low-density lipoproteins ( 9229 ). However, when used in humans, green tea doesn't consistently exhibit useful effects on cardiovascular risk factors. In human research, green tea consumption promoted flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery and improved the function of endothelial cells in blood vessels ( 53721 , 53743 , 53778 ). However, does not always appear to reduce inflammation, vascular reactivity, or lipid oxidation, and cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers may not be affected ( 37785 ). This may be due to low bioavailability of polyphenols ( 9230 , 9231 ). CNS effects Green tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine ( 519 ) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup ( 4218 ). The caffeine in green tea stimulates the central nervous system (CNS) ( 2722 ). Possible mechanisms include adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition ( 2722 ). By blocking adenosine receptors, caffeine is thought to increase the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine ( 6370 ). It has also been proposed that caffeine may decrease GABA and serotonin signaling ( 6370 ). Cognitive effects Green tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine ( 519 ) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup ( 4218 ). The caffeine content is thought to be responsible for green tea's effects on cognitive performance ( 4221 ). Cytochrome P450 effects Tea has been reported to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A1, 1A2, and 2B1 ( 3941 , 53739 ) and to inhibit CYP3A4 ( 53835 ) in vitro. While one study reported that green tea extract does not alter CYP3A4 or 2D6 activity in healthy volunteers ( 14429 ), another showed that green tea catechin induced a small reduction in CYP34A activity, while having no effect on CYP1A2, CYP12D6, and CYP12C9 activity ( 53747 ). Dental effects In human research, green tea extract appears to reduce plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation ( 7594 ). Also, when applied as a gel to the periodontal pocket, green tea appears to improve gingivitis, periodontal disease, and clinical attachment ( 90135 ). The polyphenols in green tea appear to reduce the cellular adhesiveness of bacteria associated with dental disease ( 7594 , 53738 , 54121 ). Also, green tea has demonstrated direct activity against oral bacteria in vitro ( 53705 , 53858 , 54022 , 54060 , 54071 ) and in humans after rinsing with green tea ( 102725 , 102727 ). In addition, certain green tea constituents inhibit the synthesis of bacterial insoluble glucan, the sticky substance that facilitates the accumulation of the microorganisms on smooth tooth surfaces and subsequent development of dental caries ( 36456 , 54121 ). Also, in vitro evidence suggests that the catechins epicatechin gallate (ECG) and EGCG inhibit pro-inflammatory signals normally upregulated by bacterial pathogens in dental pulp fibroblasts ( 53972 ). In humans, EGCG has been shown to reduce the progression of dental erosion, possibly mediated through its ability to inhibit the MMP enzymes ( 53975 ). Dermatological effects Some evidence suggests that oral and topical application of products containing green tea may improve skin elasticity, hydration, and roughness ( 53731 , 53924 , 54030 , 54062 ). Evidence suggests that EGCG and EGC might inhibit 5 alpha-reductase and might potentially be useful in androgen-mediated skin disorders such as androgenic alopecia, hirsutism, and acne ( 8113 ). Green tea is thought to be beneficial for preventing skin damage and cancer from ultraviolet (UV) radiation due to the antioxidant effects of polyphenols in green tea. Polyphenolic extracts of green tea, specifically EGCG and epicatechin-3-gallate, seem to produce dose-dependent topical protection against UVA and UVB sunburn. Areas of skin where green tea extracts were applied had fewer sunburned cells and less damage to epidermal Langerhans cells, which are responsible for cutaneous immune response. Green tea extracts also seem to prevent UV radiation-induced DNA damage ( 1359 ). Animal models indicate that green tea extracts reduce oxidative skin damage, skin inflammation, and epidermal hyperplasia due to UV radiation and other causes ( 6065 ). Human research suggests topical application of EGCG on sun-protected skin prevents the UVB-induced infiltration of inflammatory cells and erythema, possibly by inhibiting prostaglandins ( 53674 , 90167 ). Unlike conventional sunscreens, green tea extracts do not absorb significant amounts of light in the UV range ( 1359 ). Preliminary clinical research also suggests that topical application of EGCG reduces acne severity ( 54074 ). The beneficial effects of green tea for acne may be related to both the inhibition of Propionibacterium acnes, as well as the cytotoxic effects on sebocytes leading to a reduced sebum production as shown in vitro ( 54074 ). Diuretic effects Green tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine ( 519 ) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup ( 4218 ). Caffeine exerts a diuretic effect, with water losses estimated at 1.17 mL per milligram of caffeine ( 2712 ). Tachyphylaxis to the diuretic effect develops rapidly, diminishing fluid losses associated with caffeine intake ( 10206 ). However, caffeine-containing beverages consumed during moderate endurance exercise do not appear to compromise bodily hydration status ( 2713 ). Also, caffeine doesn't substantially affect the fluid status of people who drink caffeinated beverages on a regular basis ( 10206 ). Exercise effects In human research, green tea polyphenols improved muscular endurance ( 54040 ). The caffeine content of green tea is thought to be responsible for its effects on performance ( 4221 ). Also, protection against exercise-induced antioxidant damage may play a role ( 54053 , 104606 ). Gastrointestinal effects Green tea is commonly used for the prevention of gastric cancer. The caffeine in green tea is known to stimulate gastric acid secretion ( 11837 ). Hepatic effects Although case reports exist of hepatotoxic effects of green tea and its extract ( 14136 , 15026 , 53740 , 53742 , 53746 , 53775 , 54016 , 54027 , 90143 , 90164 )( 92356 , 102722 ), clinical research suggests the potential for benefits in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ( 90168 ). Also, population research suggests consuming more green tea, especially more than 10 cups daily, is related to decreased concentrations of hepatological markers in serum, including aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transferase, and ferritin, indicating that green tea may act protectively against disorders of the liver ( 6403 ). Hormonal effects Population research shows mixed results with respect to the preventative effects of green tea for breast cancer or its recurrence ( 3926 , 13189 , 14426 , 14427 , 53866 , 54112 , 90181 ). Interestingly, green tea intake is inversely correlated with serum concentrations of estradiol on menstrual cycle day 11 in females; this may explain the potential for benefit in hormone-related cancers ( 54106 ). Also, in animal research, green tea reduced blood levels of testosterone, estradiol, leptin, luteinizing hormone, and insulin-like growth factor ( 3922 ). However, in humans, the green tea extract enriched in EGCG, Polyphenon E did not have consistent effects on testosterone, estradiol, and estrone levels ( 54056 ). Immunologic effects There is some evidence from clinical research that taking green tea formulations reduces the risk of developing clinical cold or flu symptoms ( 53754 , 54021 ). Also, clinical research suggests that drinking a green tea high in a specific catechin reduces allergy symptoms associated with Japanese cedar pollen ( 53884 , 90156 ). In human research, green tea increased the proliferation of gamma-delta T cells ( 53754 ). Also, in vitro, in Jurkat T cells, EGCG induced the production of specific cytokines ( 53830 ). Neurologic effects Green tea is thought to have some potential neurological benefits. For prevention of Parkinson's disease, caffeine in green tea may prevent adenosine's inhibition of dopaminergic transmission. This may result in a reduction in the clinical expression of Parkinsonism ( 6022 , 36389 ). Green tea may also inhibit dopamine transport in vitro, as well as protect against effects of 6-hydroxydopamine ( 53706 , 53841 ). In vitro, EGCG has been shown to prevent the damage of dopaminergic cells by activated microglial cells by inhibiting nitric oxide and cytokine production ( 36407 ). Preliminary evidence also suggests that EGCG may prevent oxidation and apoptosis of neurons, which may protect people from developing Alzheimer's disease ( 9224 ). Also, in vitro and in animals, EGCG has been shown to increase the secretion of soluble amyloid precursor protein or decrease levels of A beta protein, inhibiting the formation of beta-amyloid peptide, associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease ( 36396 , 53751 ). The green tea constituent EGCG may also directly affect brain function. In humans, EGCG increased alpha, beta, and theta activity, mainly in the frontal and medial frontal gyrus ( 54055 ) and brain theta waves in the temporal, frontal, parietal, and occipital areas ( 54019 ). Clinical research in adults with obesity suggests that following exercise guidance in conjunction with a calorie-restricted Mediterranean diet enriched with an additional daily intake of 800 mg polyphenols from green tea and Wolffia globose may provide neuroprotective effects against age-related neurodegeneration by reducing grey matter atrophy and preserving hippocampal volume ( 107982 ). Respiratory effects Green tea contains 2% to 4% caffeine ( 519 ) or 10-80 mg caffeine per cup ( 4218 ). Caffeine decreases airway resistance and stimulates respiration, via adenosine receptor blockade and phosphodiesterase inhibition ( 11836 ). Weight loss effects Green tea is commonly used for weight loss. Evidence from clinical trials is mixed, although some studies do show weight loss with specific products ( 8114 , 37725 , 53994 , 54039 ). Early evidence indicates that a green tea extract rich in EGCG can increase calorie and fat metabolism. The caffeine, catechin, and theanine constituents of green tea might contribute to this effect ( 1453 , 8115 , 11960 ). Caffeine increases resting energy expenditure (REE) and cellular thermogenesis. It also causes an increase in nonoxidative fatty acid turnover and lipid oxidation; however, the net effect on lipid oxidation is small. The effects of caffeine on energy expenditure and lipid metabolism seem to be mediated by both sympathetic and nonsympathetic mechanisms ( 13733 ). Green tea might also affect energy expenditure in humans. However, thermogenic response or energy expenditure were not significantly increased in all studies ( 1453 , 8114 , 37712 , 48831 , 53685 , 53708 , 53869 , 53999 , 54122 , 98422 ). In healthy young men, green tea extract increased fat oxidation during exercise ( 53764 ). There is also some evidence that EGCG might suppress appetite in animal research ( 3922 ). However, there is some question about how well EGCG is absorbed orally ( 3922 ). In human research, although green tea reduced food intakes, changes in body weight and body composition were lacking ( 98422 ). The impact of EGCG and green tea on weight loss remains to be determined with well-designed studies in obese or overweight individuals.",
