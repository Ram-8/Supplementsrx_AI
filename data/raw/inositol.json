Oral inositol seems to modestly improve lipid parameters, blood pressure, and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic syndrome. Some clinical research in postmenopausal adults with metabolic syndrome following a low-calorie diet shows that taking myo-inositol 2 grams twice daily for one year reduces total cholesterol by 29 mg/dL, triglycerides by 64 mg/dL, systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 9 mmHg and 6 mmHg, respectively, increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 6 mg/dL, and improves insulin resistance when compared with placebo. It did not reduce body mass index or waist circumference in these patients ( 91554 ). A meta-analysis of clinical studies in a mixed population shows similar effects on blood pressure, especially among postmenopausal adults with metabolic syndrome, at durations exceeding 8 weeks, and at doses of at least 4 grams ( 108820 ). Inositol has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients to treat metabolic syndrome. A clinical study in postmenopausal adults with metabolic syndrome and at risk for breast cancer shows that taking a combination of inositol and alpha-lipoic acid daily for 6 months, in combination with a low-calorie diet, reduces insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) by at least 20% when compared with a low-calorie diet alone. Also, taking inositol and alpha-lipoic acid seems to increase HDL cholesterol by about 6% and reduce triglycerides by 5% when compared to baseline ( 91543 ). Another small clinical study in adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking a specific combination product containing D-chiro-inositol 40 mg, Ceylon cinnamon 250 mg, glucomannan 1000 mg, and inulin 200 mg orally daily for 4 months modestly improves total cholesterol levels and body weight, but not serum glycated hemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein levels, high-density lipoprotein levels, or triglyceride levels when compared with no intervention ( 114552 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral inositol, often in combination with folic acid, seems to improve some glycemic, lipid, metabolic, hormonal, and reproductive parameters in patients with PCOS. However, research is conflicting. Oral inositol, most frequently in the forms of myo-inositol or D-chiro-inositol, has been evaluated for efficacy in a wide range of outcomes associated with PCOS including reproductive and pregnancy outcomes, metabolic parameters, and anthropomorphic measures. Often, inositol is taken in combination with folic acid or metformin. Inositol has been investigated for its effect on metabolic parameters that are often altered in PCOS. A meta-analysis of 9 studies in patients with PCOS shows that taking myo-inositol or D-chiro-inositol with or without folic acid marginally decreases body mass index (BMI) by about 0.5 kg/m2 when compared with placebo ( 111670 ). Inositol has also been evaluated for its effect on glucose metabolism in adults with PCOS. Meta-analyses of about 10 studies show that taking myo-inositol or D-chiro-inositol with or without folic acid reduces fasting plasma glucose by 1-4 mg/dL ( 98944 , 111670 ). However, evidence is conflicting on the effect of inositol on insulin levels and measures of insulin resistance ( 98944 , 111670 ). Additionally, most studies show that inositol does not improve measures of glucose metabolism more than metformin. The effect of inositol on lipid profiles has also been studied. A meta-analysis of 2 clinical studies and other small clinical studies show that taking inositol as D-chiro-inositol with or without folic acid modestly reduces total cholesterol and triglycerides when compared with control ( 2028 , 98944 , 91552 ). Some studies have also investigated the effect of inositol on hormone levels. Meta-analyses show that inositol modulates androgen levels as shown by reduced total and free testosterone, androstenedione, and increased sex-hormone binding globulin when compared with placebo. ( 2028 , 91552 , 98944 , 111670 ). The validity of these effects is limited by high heterogeneity in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, dose, and treatment duration within the included studies. Myo-inositol has also been compared with metformin in some clinical research, with some evidence of benefit ( 95085 , 95086 ). Meta-analyses of small clinical studies show that taking myo-inositol 2-4 grams daily, with or without folic acid, for 12-24 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), BMI, waist-hip circumference, or androgen levels when compared with metformin 1.5-2.5 grams daily ( 100705 , 108823 , 111670 , 111670 ). However, inositol seems to have a lower risk of adverse effects than metformin. These analyses are limited due to the small size, methodological issues, and high heterogeneity of the included studies. In combination with metformin, small clinical studies show that taking metformin, myo-inositol 550 mg, and D-chiro-inositol 150 mg twice daily is associated with improved lipid parameters and postprandial insulin levels when compared with metformin alone ( 108822 ). Meta-analyses and clinical studies have investigated the effect of inositol on ovulation, reproduction, and pregnancy outcomes. Some research suggests that inositol increases ovulation rate, promotes cycle normalization, and improves ovarian function in patients with PCOS ( 2028 , 91552 , 98944 , 111670 ). A small clinical study shows that taking myo-inositol 4 grams and folic acid 400 mcg (Inofolic, Lo.Li.Pharma) daily for three spontaneous cycles induces ovulation in about 62% of individuals with anovulatory PCOS and insulin resistance. Adding clomiphene citrate with myo-inositol induces ovulation in about 72% of the patients who remain anovulatory after treatment with myo-inositol alone ( 91547 ). Another clinical study shows that taking a combination of inositol 2 grams, folic acid 200 mcg, and N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg (Ovaric HP, Just Pharma) twice daily for 12 months improves ovulation rates in PCOS patients with oligomenorrhea, regardless of insulin sensitivity at baseline ( 91553 ). Despite evidence that inositol improves ovulation rates, it does not appear to impact pregnancy rates ( 111670 ). Some research has also investigated the effects of taking both isomers of inositol concomitantly. Taking myo-inositol 550 mg plus D-chiro-inositol 13.8 mg (Inofolic Combi, Lo.Li.Pharma) twice daily, beginning 12 weeks before ovarian hyperstimulation and continuing throughout pregnancy, improves oocyte quality when compared to treatment with D-chiro-inositol alone. The combination appears to increase fertilization rate in patients aged 35 years or younger, but not those older than 35 years ( 91544 ). Other clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol 550 mg and D-chiro-inositol 150 mg twice daily for 12 weeks improves pregnancy rates and live birth rates by an additional 10% and 11%, respectively, when compared with myo-inositol 550 mg plus D-chiro-inositol 13.8 mg. The higher-dose combination also resulted in a 15% lower rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome when compared with those taking the lower dose of D-chiro-inositol ( 102317 ). Lastly, other research shows that taking myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol together may improve metabolic parameters faster than taking myo-inositol alone ( 91550 ). Research has also evaluated the effects of inositol on other pertinent clinical outcomes in PCOS. Several small clinical studies show that taking the combination of myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol, alone or in combination with metformin, improves menstrual cycle irregularity when compared with metformin alone, but not as much as a taking a combined hormonal contraceptive ( 108822 , 108824 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded nature of the studies. Also, a small clinical study shows that taking metformin with myo-inositol 550 mg and D-chiro-inositol 150 mg twice daily is associated with improved acne, but not hirsutism, at 6 months, when compared with metformin alone ( 108822 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the unblinded nature of the study. More research is needed to clarify the effect of inositol on anthropometric, metabolic, and endocrine outcomes in patients with PCOS. more Preterm labor. Oral inositol in combination with folic acid seems to prevent preterm labor in individuals at risk for gestational diabetes. A meta-analysis of five clinical trials in individuals at risk for gestational diabetes shows that taking myo-inositol plus folic acid daily, beginning during the first trimester and continuing throughout pregnancy, decreases the risk of preterm delivery by 64% when compared with folic acid alone. Patients in all but one study included in this analysis took myo-inositol 2 grams plus folic acid 200 mcg twice daily, while patients in the other study took myo-inositol 1100 mg plus D-chiro-inositol 27.6 mg and folic acid 400 mcg daily ( 100706 ). It's unclear if these results are generalizable to individuals with a low risk for gestational diabetes. more Possibly Ineffective Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Oral or intravenous inositol does not seem to prevent ARDS in preterm infants and may be associated with worsened outcomes. Historically, small clinical trials in infants with or at risk for ARDS have suggested that myo-inositol, given parenterally and enterally for 5-10 days, might improve survival and reduce the risk of death and serious complications ( 2191 , 2192 , 91546 ). However, a large, high-quality clinical study in infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation at risk for ARDS shows that myo-inositol 40 mg/kg given intravenously and then enterally every 12 hours for up to 70 days does not reduce the risk of death or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). In fact, the rate of death or type 1 ROP increased by 7% in the myo-inositol group when compared to the control group, and a higher incidence of adverse events in the myo-inositol group, including poor perfusion, hypotension, and infections, led to early trial discontinuation ( 98946 ). Long-term follow-up until 24 months corrected age confirms that the initial increase in mortality rate in the myo-inositol group remained stable; however, there was no difference in a composite outcome of death or survival with moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment, as well as no difference in the risk of ROP, between the treatment and control groups ( 108819 ). The most recent meta-analysis, which incorporates this large clinical study, concludes that inositol supplementation does not reduce the risk of death in infants at risk for ARDS ( 102319 ). more Anxiety. Oral inositol does not seem to be beneficial for patients with anxiety. A meta-analysis of four clinical trials shows that taking inositol orally does not improve anxiety severity in patients with anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, when compared with placebo ( 91549 ). more Depression. Oral inositol does not seem to be beneficial for patients with depression. Guidelines from the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that inositol in doses up to 12 grams daily is not currently recommended as monotherapy or adjunctive use for major depressive disorder due to a lack of evidence for efficacy ( 110318 ). Additionally, a meta-analysis of seven clinical trials shows that inositol does not significantly improve symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar depression, major depressive disorder, or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) ( 91549 ). While limited research shows that patients receiving inositol for 4 weeks may improve, patients initially responding to inositol seem to relapse rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment ( 2026 , 2185 ). Additionally, taking inositol with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) doesn't appear to improve the effectiveness of SSRI therapy or improve depression in SSRI treatment failures ( 2025 , 10851 ). more Diabetic neuropathy. Oral inositol does not seem to be beneficial for patients with diabetic neuropathy. Most preliminary clinical research shows that taking inositol orally doesn't improve the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy ( 2193 , 2194 , 2195 ). more Retinopathy of prematurity. Oral or intravenous inositol does not seem to prevent retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants. A meta-analysis of six clinical trials shows that myo-inositol, given parenterally and/or enterally, does not seem to reduce the risk of ROP when compared with placebo in preterm infants ( 100704 ). A large, high-quality clinical study included in this meta-analysis shows that myo-inositol 40 mg/kg given intravenously and then enterally every 12 hours for up to 70 days does not reduce the risk of death or ROP in infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation. In fact, the rate of death or type 1 ROP increased by 7% in the myo-inositol group when compared with placebo and a higher incidence of adverse events in the myo-inositol group, including poor perfusion, hypotension, and infections, led to early trial discontinuation ( 98946 ). Long-term follow-up until 24 months corrected age confirms that the initial increase in mortality rate in the myo-inositol group remained stable; however, there was no difference in a composite outcome of death or survival with moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment, as well as no difference in the risk of ROP, between the treatment and control groups ( 108819 ). more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Age-related testosterone deficiency. It is unclear if oral D-chiro-inositol is beneficial in patients with age-related testosterone deficiency. A very small clinical study in males aged 65-75 years with low-normal morning testosterone levels and signs and symptoms of androgen deficiency shows that taking D-chiro-inositol 600 mg twice daily for 30 days improves sexual function and physical strength when compared with baseline ( 108821 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Bipolar disorder. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in patients with bipolar disorder. Evidence is conflicting on whether inositol helps treat bipolar disorder in children. One very small preliminary study in children aged 5-12 years with bipolar disorder not on concomitant mood-stabilizing medications shows that taking inositol 80 mg/kg (maximum 2 grams) daily for 12 weeks reduces manic symptoms when compared to baseline. Additionally, taking a combination of inositol 80 mg/kg and high eicosapentaenoic acid omega-3 fatty acid capsules (EPA; Nordic Naturals) 1650-3000 mg daily for 12 weeks reduces manic and depressive symptoms when compared to baseline ( 95092 ). However, another more recent study with the same intervention and protocol shows that the combination of inositol and high eicosapentaenoic acid omega-3 fatty acid reduces symptoms of depression, but does not improve manic symptoms, when compared with either ingredient taken alone ( 111676 ). more Chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. Oral inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in adults undergoing breast cancer surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy shows that taking inositol orally 390 mg twice daily and applying IP-6 gel 4% twice daily to the surgical site, starting 2 weeks before adjuvant chemotherapy and stopping 2 weeks after the last cycle, attenuates reductions in white and red blood cell counts when compared with no intervention. Using inositol and IP-6 also improves breast and arm symptom scores and some quality of life scores; however, these improvements were not consistent over time. more Child growth. Oral inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A sub-analysis of a large randomized controlled trial shows that twice daily maternal use of a drink supplement containing myo-inositol 4 grams, folic acid, vitamins D, B6, and B12, zinc, lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and other nutrients throughout pregnancy increases the likelihood of the infant being in the normal weight range after 2 years of follow up when compared with placebo. Infants of mothers using the drink supplement had a reduced likelihood of rapid weight gain when compared with placebo; other anthropomorphic measurements were similar between groups ( 115691 ). It is unclear if any effects are due to inositol, other ingredients, or the combination. more Diabetes. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for the treatment of type 1 diabetes or the prevention of gestational diabetes. Preliminary clinical research in patients with type 1 diabetes and a body mass index of at least 25 kg/m2 shows that taking a specific combination product containing D-chiro-inositol and folic acid (Chirofol 500, LJ Pharma) daily for 6 months, along with insulin therapy, decreases glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by approximately 0.5% when compared to taking folic acid alone with insulin therapy. However, there was no difference between groups with respect to insulin resistance or body mass index ( 95088 ). Most research shows that taking inositol during pregnancy prevents gestational diabetes. However, most studies conducted to date are of low quality and it is unclear if the results are generalizable. Meta-analyses of 4-7 clinical studies in pregnant adults, some with overweight and obesity, shows that taking myo-inositol 2-4 g daily with folic acid (usually as Inofolic, Lo.Li. Pharma International) may reduce the relative risk of gestational diabetes by 57% to 92% and reduce insulin requirements in adults at risk for gestational diabetes. Inositol may also be associated with improved infant outcomes such as increased gestational age at birth and reduced preterm delivery, but does not seem to influence birth weight, NICU admission rate, neonatal hypoglycemia, the incidence of shoulder dystocia, macrosomia, or cesarian delivery when compared with control ( 100706 , 103750 , 104688 , 111664 , 111667 , 111671 , 111677 , 114560 ). The validity of these findings is limited by significant heterogeneity within the included studies, concerns about blinding, and overall low-quality evidence. Research evaluating a lower daily dose of myo-inositol 1.1 grams with D-chiro-inositol 27.6 mg and folic acid 400 mcg (Inofolic Combi, Lo.Li. Pharma International) during pregnancy shows no effect on incidence of gestational diabetes when compared with folic acid alone in adults with a family history of diabetes ( 95082 , 103750 ). Some evidence suggests that initiation of myo-inositol, in combination with vitamins and other ingredients, earlier during pregnancy (e.g., 7 weeks' gestation) may be associated with increased blood glucose levels at 28 weeks' gestation. Some researchers have postulated that the beneficial effects of myo-inositol may be optimized by initiating therapy later in pregnancy. However, this hypothesis has not been well researched ( 115694 ). In patients eventually diagnosed with gestational diabetes, one small clinical study shows that taking myo-inositol 2 grams reduces the number of patients requiring insulin by at least 50% ( 104688 ), although another small clinical study shows that adding D-chiro-inositol, myo-inositol, or both to folic acid does not affect insulin resistance when compared with placebo ( 98945 ). more Dyslipidemia. Although there has been interest in using oral inositol for hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of inositol for these conditions. Erectile dysfunction (ED). Oral inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Another very small study in males with overweight or obesity, mild ED, and normal to low androgen levels shows that taking a combination product containing myo-inositol 4000 mg, alpha-lipoic acid, folic acid, and apple (Sinopol Forte) improves measures of erectile dysfunction when compared with baseline ( 111674 ). The validity of these effects is limited by the small sample size and the lack of a comparator group, and it is unclear if these effects are due to inositol, other ingredients, or the combination. more Hypertension. Although there has been interest in using oral inositol for hypertension, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of inositol for this condition. Hypothyroidism. Inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A meta-analysis of clinical and observational research in adults with hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and other thyroid disorders shows that taking a combination of inositol 600-1200 mg and selenium 83-166 mg orally daily for 6-12 months modestly improves thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and thyroxine levels when compared with control ( 114562 ). Clinical research in females aged 18 to 50 years with or at risk for subclinical hypothyroidism in Slovakia shows that taking myo-inositol 600 mg and selenium 83 mcg daily for 6 months reduces patient-reported hypothyroid symptoms including fatigue, menstrual cycle irregularity, and intolerance to heat or cold ( 110591 ). The interpretation of this result is limited by the lack of a control group. In addition, it is unclear if the effects in these studies are due to myo-inositol, selenium, or the combination. more Infertility. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in adults undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF). Many small studies report conflicting effects of oral myo-inositol on fertilization rates, implantation rates, and live birth rates in adults undergoing IVF or ICSI ( 103752 , 108825 , 111672 ). Many of these trials used a specific combination product containing myo-inositol 4 grams and folic acid 400 mcg (Inofolic, Lo.Li. Pharma International S.r.l) daily, starting 1-3 months before ICSI and continuing until ovulation ( 103752 , 108825 ). Meta-analyses of up to 8 small randomized controlled trials in adults undergoing assisted reproduction (e.g., ICSI, IVF) with or without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) shows that taking myo-inositol 2-4 grams orally daily, with or without folic acid, for 8-12 weeks modestly improves the number of oocytes obtained, but does not affect the miscarriage rate or clinical pregnancy rate, when compared with placebo ( 115693 ). The validity of this study is limited by moderate heterogeneity. The effects of inositol on fertility have also been studied in patients with specific comorbidities. A case-control study in long-term survivors of lymphoma suggests that taking myo-inositol 400 mg and D-chiro-inositol 45 mg (Ovofert Fast, CRL Pharma) three times daily for 12 months is associated with reductions in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea and a modest increase in antral follicle count of the right ovary when compared with control ( 111673 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a lack of blinding. Inositol has also been evaluated in females with PCOS. A meta-analysis of clinical studies in adults with PCOS undergoing IVF or ICSI shows that inositol does not improve pregnancy rates when compared to no treatment. However, inositol may increase clinical pregnancy rates when compared with metformin ( 111675 ). Inositol has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A large clinical study in females planning to conceive shows that taking a combination product containing myo-inositol 4 grams, vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, zinc, and probiotics does not improve time-to-conception, clinical pregnancy rates, or live birth rates when compared with a standard micronutrient supplement. However, the supplement shortens time-to-conception in adults with overweight to durations equivalent to patients who are not overweight, but lengthens time to conception in adults with obesity when compared with placebo ( 111665 ). It is unclear whether these effects are due to inositol, other ingredients, or the combination. more Insomnia. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for improving sleep during pregnancy. Clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol 2 grams plus folic acid 200 mcg (Inofolic, Lo.Li. Pharma International) before bed for 10 weeks, starting at 14 weeks gestation, improves overall measures of sleep quality by a small amount when compared with folic acid alone. However, this improvement was not maintained until 37-38 weeks' gestation. Also, the study was not limited to patients with poor sleep quality during pregnancy, but to any healthy pregnant individual ( 104687 ). more Lithium-induced side effects. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for reducing lithium-induced side effects. A small clinical study suggests that taking inositol 6 grams daily for 10 weeks may improve psoriasis associated with lithium therapy when compared with baseline ( 11972 ). However, taking inositol orally does not seem to improve other lithium-induced adverse effects, such as tremor, thirst, and changes in thyroid and adrenal function ( 2027 ). more Lung cancer. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for slowing the rate of bronchial dysplasia. Preliminary clinical research in smokers with bronchial dysplasia considered at high risk for lung cancer shows that taking myo-inositol (Tsuno Food Industries Co., Ltd.) 9 grams orally once daily for 2 weeks then twice daily for 6 months, does not increase the rate of complete or partial response when compared with placebo ( 95090 ). more Mastalgia. Inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for cyclic mastalgia; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small retrospective study in females with cyclic mastalgia suggests that applying a specific product containing inositol, Boswellia serrata, and betaine (Eumastos Gel, Lo.Li. Pharma s.r.l.) 2.5 grams topically once daily from the 10 th to the 25 th day of the menstrual cycle for three months is associated with reductions in mastalgia pain scores when compared with a control cohort ( 115695 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the retrospective nature of the study and the lack of a placebo control. more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for NAFLD. A small clinical study in adults with NAFLD and obesity shows that taking myo-inositol powder 4 grams daily for 8 weeks does not improve liver health markers, such as liver function test levels or liver steatosis, but does improve some components of lipid profiles, glycemic indices, and anthropometric measures when compared to baseline ( 111304 ) However, this study may have been inadequately powered to detect differences in some of the outcomes. more Obesity. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in patients with overweight or obesity. A meta-analysis of 15 clinical studies in adults shows that taking inositol 600-4450 mg daily for 6-48 weeks decreases body mass index (BMI) by about 0.4 kg/m2. Subgroup analysis suggests that myo-inositol may be beneficial at a dosage less than 1000 mg for less than 12 weeks, especially in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and overweight or obesity, with higher baseline BMI, and above 40 years of age ( 111666 ). However, the validity of this finding is limited by significant heterogeneity in the included studies. more Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in patients with OCD. One preliminary clinical study in adults with OCD shows that taking inositol 18 grams daily for 6 weeks improves Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores when compared with placebo ( 2186 ). However, taking inositol does not seem to improve the severity or type of OCD symptoms in patients already taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( 91556 ). Both of these studies were small, and treatment was administered for only 6 weeks. more Panic disorder. Oral inositol seems to improve symptoms of panic disorder. A very small clinical study shows that taking inositol 12 grams daily reduces the severity and rate of panic attacks and the severity of agoraphobia over 4 weeks of treatment when compared with placebo ( 2184 ). Another very small clinical study shows that taking inositol 18 grams daily for one month may be as effective as fluvoxamine 150 mg daily for treatment of panic disorder ( 10387 ). However, the one-month duration may not have provided adequate time to see the full effects of fluvoxamine. more Postpartum complications. Inositol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A post-hoc analysis of a clinical study suggests that higher blood levels of myo-inositol early in pregnancy are associated with less postpartum blood loss when compared with lower blood levels of myo-insositol ( 115692 ). The effects of inositol supplementation are unclear. more Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial in patients with PTSD. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking inositol 12 grams daily for 4 weeks does not improve distress when compared with placebo in patients with PTSD ( 91557 ). more Pregnancy-induced hypertension. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for preventing hypertension during pregnancy. In patients with a body mass index (BMI) between 25-29.9 kg/m2, preliminary clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol 2 grams plus folic acid 200 mcg (Inofolic, Lo.Li. Pharma International) twice daily, beginning during the first trimester and continuing throughout pregnancy, decreases the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension by 66% when compared with folic acid alone ( 104688 ). more Psoriasis. It is unclear if oral or topical inositol is beneficial for improving symptoms of psoriasis. One small clinical study shows that taking inositol 6 grams daily for 10 weeks does not improve symptoms of psoriasis in a small group of patients when compared to baseline. However, taking this dose of inositol has a moderate effect on overall symptoms in patients with psoriasis related to lithium use ( 11972 ). Preliminary clinical research also shows that topical use of D-chiro-inositol is unlikely to be beneficial for reducing overall symptoms of psoriasis. Topical application of inositol 0.25% or 1% for 6 weeks improves overall symptoms when compared with baseline. However, the inositol-containing creams were no more effective than the control cream ( 104686 ). Inositol has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A small prospective observational study in adults with mild plaque psoriasis suggests that applying amino-inositol and urea 40% cream (Inosit U40, Biogena) 1-2 times daily for 4 weeks is associated with reductions in the severity and extent of psoriasis symptoms and improvements in quality of life measures when compared to baseline ( 111668 ). The validity of these effects is limited by a small sample size, a lack of a comparator group, insufficient blinding, and the observational study design. more Trichotillomania. It is unclear if oral inositol is beneficial for reducing hair pulling. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking inositol in doses ranging from 6-18 grams daily over a period of 10 weeks is no more effective than placebo in reducing subjective or clinician-documented symptoms of hair pulling in patients with trichotillomania ( 95089 ). more More evidence is needed to rate inositol for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Inositol has been used with apparent safety in doses up to 18 grams daily for up to 6 weeks or 6 grams daily for 10 weeks ( 2184 , 2185 , 2187 , 95089 ). Myo-inositol 4 grams daily has also been used with apparent safety for 6 months ( 95085 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of inositol when used topically. CHILDREN: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately. Inositol 80 mg/kg (maximum 2 grams) has been taken daily for up to 12 weeks in children aged 5-12 years ( 95092 ). ...when used enterally or intravenously and appropriately in premature infants for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome for up to 10 days ( 2191 , 2192 , 91546 , 91551 ). CHILDREN: Possibly Unsafe when used enterally or intravenously for extended durations in premature infants. A large clinical study in infants born at less than 28 weeks' gestation found that myo-inositol 40 mg/kg, given intravenously and then enterally every 12 hours for up to 10 weeks, was associated with a small increased risk of death ( 98946 ). Long-term follow-up until 24 months corrected age confirms that the initial increase in mortality rate in the myo-inositol group remained stable; however, there was no difference in a composite outcome of death or survival with moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment, as well as no difference in the risk of retinopathy of prematurity, between those who received myo-inositol or control ( 108819 ). PREGNANCY: Possibly Safe when used orally and appropriately, short-term. Myo-inositol has been used with apparent safety in amounts up to 4000 mg daily during pregnancy ( 91548 , 95082 , 104688 ). LACTATION: Insufficient reliable information available; avoid using. Breast milk is rich in endogenous inositol ( 2138 ); however, the effects of exogenously administered inositol are not known.",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: Inositol is typically used in doses of 1-4 grams daily, often in combination with folic acid 200-400 mcg daily. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Topical: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Children Oral: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Standardization & Formulation Inositol can be found in nine different stereoisomer forms, but the isomers myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol are most commonly used in supplements ( 91555 , 95082 , 95085 ).",
  "interactions_text": "ANTIDIABETES DRUGS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence A (High-quality meta-analysis (quantitative systematic review)) Theoretically, taking inositol with antidiabetes drugs might increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Clinical research shows that inositol lowers blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in patients with diabetes ( 95083 , 95084 , 95088 ). more",
  "mechanism_text": "General Endogenous inositol is an essential component of cell membrane phospholipids. It has weak lipotropic activity, and can move fat out of liver and intestine cells ( 2187 ). Inositol has a variety of stereoisomers, including myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol. Myo-inositol is the most abundant form in the central nervous system (CNS). Biological function varies among the isomers ( 2047 , 2048 ). Myo-inositol is a source of second messengers such as diacylglycerol. It is required for growth of human cells ( 95090 ). Anti-carcinogenic effects Dysplasia in the central airways and peripheral lung is a risk marker for lung cancer, and there is an interest in using myo-inositol for preventing lung cancer. However, early clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol (Tsuno Food Industries Co., Ltd.) 9 grams orally once daily for 2 weeks then twice daily for 6 months, does not significantly affect bronchial dysplasia in smokers with bronchial dysplasia considered high risk for lung cancer, compared to placebo. There was also no difference in Ki-67 (a marker of proliferation) in the bronchial biopsies with dysplasia between groups post-treatment. However, myo-inositol lead to a significant decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL), with a trend towards decreasing oxidant level. Increased baseline plasma and BAL levels of Clara cell protein-16 (an antiinflammatory protein secreted by bronchiolar cells) were associated with positive outcomes as well as decreased levels of plasma myeloperoxidase ( 95090 ). In smokers with epithelial bronchial dysplasia, the PI3K pathway is activated. The PI3K/Akt pathway regulates cell proliferation and survival. PI3K gene expression in normal epithelium decreased in patients who experienced a complete response to myo-inositol, suggesting that myo-inositiol inhibits PI3K signaling. This was not seen in non-responders nor in the placebo group ( 95090 ). Central nervous system (CNS) effects There is interest in using inositol for various psychiatric disorders. Decreased brain levels of inositol have been seen in patients suffering from depression, anxiety and compulsive disorders ( 95089 , 95092 ). Inositol is a constituent of the intracellular phosphatidyl inositol second messenger system, which is linked to several neurotransmitters including alpha 1 noradrenergic, serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate and cholinergic receptors ( 10850 , 11972 , 95089 , 95092 ). Inositol may play a role in the interactions between G protein-coupled receptors and their ligands particularly in the serotonergic pathway ( 95089 , 95092 ). Inositol might reverse desensitization of serotonin receptors ( 2187 ). Limited clinical evidence suggests exogenous inositol may have benefits similar to selective-serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in conditions such as panic disorder, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Dermatologic effects Supplemental inositol seems to help psoriasis that is made worse or triggered by lithium therapy. The mechanism is unknown, but lithium seems to cause a reduction of inositol in both the brain and other tissues. Supplementation with inositol doesn't seem to adversely affect the efficacy of lithium for bipolar disorder ( 11972 ). Fertility effects There is interest in using inositol for infertility. In patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), clinical research shows that taking myo-inositol, D-chiro-inositol, or a combination of these two forms, seems to improve ovulation and pregnancy rates ( 91544 , 91550 , 91553 , 102317 ). In patients with oligoasthenospermia, clinical research shows that treating sperm with myo-inositol in vitro increases sperm motility. This increased motility results in an 18% increased rate of pregnancy during intrauterine insemination when compared with control ( 102318 ). Growth effects There is interest in using inositol for growth. Preliminary clinical research in children with idiopathic short stature shows that taking an inositol and vitamin B solution, 10 mL twice daily, for 12 months modestly increases height when compared to baseline. Improvements were larger in those that also completed stretching exercises ( 112280 ). Insulin sensitizing effects In laboratory and animal studies, it has been shown that insulin resistance is directly related to a deficiency in D-chiro-inositol and an imbalance with myo-inositol. ( 95086 , 95088 ). D-chiro-inositol acts as a second messenger of insulin signaling and is an insulin sensitizer. Laboratory research suggests that it possesses insulin-mimetic activity and, in peripheral tissues, leads to disposal of intracellular glucose and glycogen storage ( 95088 ). Inositol is also a precursor for phosphoinositides. Phosphoinositides play a role in cell signaling and are also secondary messengers involved in glucose metabolism and insulin like effects. Inositol is also a precursor for inositol phosphoglycans (IPG). There are two groups, the P-type and A-type, which are antagonists of each other. The P-type are involved in the activation of glycolysis, while the A type suppresses steps of glycolysis. Insulin resistance leads to increases in urinary inositol metabolites, mostly the A-type. This alters the ratio of A to P-type, leading to a suppression of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Providing inositol supplements in theory, shifts the ratio of A and P-type back to normal ( 95082 , 95083 ). Furthermore, inositol may increase levels of adipocytokines, particularly adiponectin, which are negatively correlated with glucose and insulin concentrations. When insulin binds to receptors, it may stimulate the intracellular transport of inositol phosphoglycan. Myo-inositol may activate lipogenesis via stimulation of acetyl-CoA-carboxylase ( 95083 ). It's thought that a defect in the availability or metabolism of inositol or IPGs may play a role in insulin resistance in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ( 95085 ). As such, there is interest in using inositol in patients with PCOS. Researchers think that inositol induces ovulation in these patients by improving insulin sensitivity. It also produces the second messenger inositol triphosphate which is involved in regulation of certain hormones such as thyroid stimulating hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone as well ( 95084 , 95085 ). Reduced insulin resistance is also thought to be responsible for improving other symptoms associated with PCOS, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, obesity, and increased serum testosterone concentrations ( 2028 ). Additionally, patients with insulin resistance, including those with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes, might have D-chiro-inositol deficiency ( 2028 ).",
