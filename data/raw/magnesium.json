Various magnesium salts, including citrate, hydroxide, oxide, and sulfate, are ingredients in bowel preparation products available over-the-counter or by prescription only. more Constipation. Magnesium salts are effective when used short-term orally to treat constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). Magnesium citrate, hydroxide, oxide, and sulfate salts are commonly used as laxatives. Magnesium citrate 11.3-17.45 grams has been used; magnesium hydroxide 2.4-4.8 grams, as 30-60 mL of milk of magnesia, has also been used ( 113483 , 113484 ). Magnesium sulfate, also known as Epsom salt, which seems to have the most potent effect, has been used as 10-30 grams ( 6430 , 113485 ). Magnesium salts should only be used for occasional treatment of constipation, and doses should be taken with a full 8-ounce glass of water. Magnesium oxide seems to be beneficial in adults with CIC when taken short-term. Clinical guidelines published by the American Gastroenterology Association and American College of Gastroenterology in 2023 give a conditional recommendation suggesting the use of magnesium oxide over managing CIC without magnesium oxide based on low-quality studies conducted over 4 weeks. The recommended starting dose is 400-500 mg daily with dose titration per symptom response and side effects ( 112859 ). A small clinical study in patients with CIC who are not taking chronic medications shows that taking magnesium oxide 1.5 grams in three divided doses daily for 28 days increases spontaneous bowel movements when compared with placebo ( 104397 ). It is unknown if magnesium is beneficial for CIC when used long-term. more Dyspepsia. Magnesium salts are effective when used orally as antacids. Magnesium carbonate, hydroxide, oxide, or trisilicate salts are used orally as antacids to reduce symptoms of gastric hyperacidity or gastroesophageal reflux. Magnesium hydroxide has the fastest onset of action. The onset for magnesium carbonate is slower due to its crystal structure. Magnesium trisilicate has the slowest onset and longest duration of action due to poor solubility ( 6844 ). Doses used include magnesium hydroxide 400-1200 mg (5-15 mL of milk of magnesia) up to four times daily, or magnesium oxide 800 mg daily ( 15 ). more Eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate is considered the drug of choice for control of seizures. Intravenous (IV) and/or intramuscular (IM) magnesium sulfate is considered the agent of choice for seizure prophylaxis during eclampsia by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) ( 15 , 12591 , 12592 , 61012 , 61184 ). Typical doses include 4-6 grams of magnesium sulfate by IV infusion in 250 mL of dextrose 5% or normal saline solution, followed by 4-5 grams of magnesium sulfate IM every 4 hours, or 1-3 grams per hour by continuous IV infusion. Doses should be adjusted according to serum levels and urinary excretion, and should not exceed 30-40 grams of magnesium sulfate daily ( 15 , 12591 ). Meta-analyses of clinical research show that treatment with IV or IM magnesium reduces the risk of seizure recurrence by 33% to 69% when compared with phenytoin, and by 47% to 60% when compared with diazepam ( 19960 , 60818 , 60954 , 60964 , 61105 ). One preliminary clinical study shows that lower doses of IV magnesium sulfate (9 grams loading dose and maintenance of 2.5 grams every 4 hours for 24 hours) are as effective as higher doses (14 grams loading dose and maintenance of 5 grams every 4 hours for 24 hours) for reducing the recurrence of eclamptic seizures ( 89383 ). It is generally recommended that treatment be continued for at least 24 hours after the last seizure ( 15 ). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for eclampsia. more Hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia can be effectively treated with oral or parenteral magnesium. Taking magnesium orally or parenterally is helpful for treating and preventing hypomagnesemia associated with alcoholism, cirrhosis of the liver, congestive heart failure (CHF), severe or prolonged diarrhea or vomiting, kidney dysfunction, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pancreatitis, malabsorption syndromes, and other conditions ( 6280 , 6281 , 8088 , 8089 ). The dose and salt of magnesium for oral replacement therapy should be chosen carefully to avoid causing diarrhea. The gluconate and chloride salts cause less diarrhea, while the oxide salt is more likely to cause diarrhea and should be avoided. Magnesium chloride should also be avoided due to poor solubility which decreases absorption ( 6430 , 8099 , 10664 ). Orally, magnesium sulfate 3 grams every 6 hours for four doses has been used for hypomagnesemia ( 15 ). Parenteral magnesium doses must be individualized according to serum magnesium levels, but a typical starting dose for mild deficiency is 1 gram of magnesium sulfate intramuscularly (IM) every 6 hours for 4 doses ( 15 ). For more severe deficiency, 5 grams of magnesium sulfate may be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion in 1 liter of dextrose 5% or normal saline solution over 3 hours ( 15 ). more Pre-eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate is considered the drug of choice for seizure prophylaxis in patients with pre-eclampsia. Intravenous (IV) and/or intramuscular (IM) magnesium sulfate is considered the agent of choice for seizure prophylaxis during pre-eclampsia by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) ( 12591 , 12592 , 61012 , 61184 ). Some meta-analyses show that IV administration of magnesium sulfate reduces the risk of eclampsia when compared with placebo, phenytoin, or diazepam in patients with pre-eclampsia ( 19960 , 60818 , 60960 , 60979 ). A typical initial dose is 4-5 grams of magnesium sulfate by IV infusion in 250 mL of dextrose 5% or normal saline solution, followed by 4-5 grams of magnesium sulfate IM every 4 hours, or 1-3 grams of magnesium sulfate per hour by continuous IV infusion. Doses should be adjusted according to serum levels and urinary excretion, and should not exceed 30-40 grams of magnesium sulfate daily ( 15 , 12591 ). The optimal duration of prophylaxis has not been determined. A meta-analysis suggests that using a shorter duration of 12 hours or less is not associated with an increase in risk of eclamptic seizures when compared with regimens of 24 hours or longer ( 108732 ). However, studies are likely underpowered due to the low incidence of eclampsia. Oral magnesium has been evaluated for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in healthy adults, but taking magnesium citrate 300 mg daily, starting at 12-20 weeks' gestation and continuing until delivery, does not reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia when compared with placebo ( 103724 ). more Likely Effective Cerebral palsy. Most evidence shows that antenatal magnesium reduces the risk of cerebral palsy in preterm infants, although there are some inconsistent results. Most clinical studies and meta-analyses show that antenatal magnesium sulfate reduces the risk of cerebral palsy by about 32% and the risk of motor dysfunction by about 45% in preterm infants ( 60915 , 60927 , 60931 , 61001 , 97485 , 103734 , 103754 , 114675 , 114681 ). The lowest effective dose of magnesium sulfate seems to be 4 grams intravenously, with or without a maintenance dose of 1 gram/hour until birth or for 24 hours. In obese females, a higher dose, based on body weight, may be needed ( 97485 , 97495 , 103734 , 103754 ). However, some studies have inconsistent results ( 8093 , 19998 , 98293 , 98295 , 112784 ). Giving females at risk of imminent preterm birth (prior to 32 weeks), intravenous magnesium sulfate 4.5 grams over 20 minutes followed by 1 gram per hour until birth or for 24 hours, in addition to a standard treatment protocol, does not reduce the incidence of cerebral palsy ( 112784 ). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this purpose. more Seizures. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is used for treating seizures of various etiologies. Intravenous magnesium sulfate may be useful for controlling seizures associated with epilepsy, glomerulonephritis, hypothyroidism, and acute nephritis in children ( 15 ). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this purpose. more Torsades de pointes. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is the first-line treatment for torsades de pointes after measures to correct precipitating factors have been unsuccessful. Intravenous magnesium sulfate has been used successfully to treat the life-threatening ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes ( 15 , 6844 ). The Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines of the American Heart Association recommend a dose of 1 to 2 grams diluted in 50-100 mL Dextrose 5% solution given IV over 5-60 minutes, followed by a continuous IV infusion of 0.5-1 gram/hour. more Possibly Effective Arrhythmia. Magnesium sulfate is effective for the specific type of ventricular tachycardia known as torsades de pointes, and seems to be helpful for treating other types of arrhythmias. Evidence for the role of oral or intravenous magnesium in preventing postoperative arrhythmias is conflicting. Administering magnesium intravenously or orally may be helpful for treating atrial and ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, and supraventricular tachycardia ( 9497 , 13352 , 13354 , 13355 , 13356 , 60804 , 60829 , 60877 , 61113 , 111696 ). Arrhythmias associated with congestive heart failure have been treated with magnesium sulfate 8 grams infused over 12 hours ( 9497 ). For rate control in atrial fibrillation, magnesium sulfate 2.5 grams IV over 20 minutes, followed by 2.5 grams IV over 2 hours has been used ( 13356 ). For paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, single doses of 1-4 grams of magnesium chloride have been used ( 13352 ). For atrial tachycardia, 2 grams of magnesium sulfate in 10 mL of dextrose 5% solution has been given IV over 1-10 minutes, followed by 5-10 grams of magnesium sulfate in 250-500 mL dextrose 5% solution as an IV infusion over 5 hours ( 13354 , 13355 ). Research on the effects of intravenous magnesium for preventing arrhythmias after cardiac surgery is conflicting. Some meta-analyses show that intravenous magnesium reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, or supraventricular arrhythmias following cardiac surgery by 23% to 48% when compared with placebo ( 60814 , 60826 , 60828 , 60838 , 61008 , 61033 , 61181 , 97487 , 97490 ). Doses of magnesium sulfate used include 30 mg/kg in 500 mL normal saline ( 97490 ), or 80-100 mg/kg added to the cardioplegia solution ( 97487 ). Also, one small study in adults after CABG surgery suggests that taking magnesium hydroxide 1600 mg orally reduces arrhythmia as effectively as receiving magnesium sulfate 2000 mg intravenously ( 99315 ). However, other meta-analyses that only include higher-quality trials show that magnesium supplementation does not reduce the risk of ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias following cardiac surgery ( 61010 , 61024 , 61031 , 105081 ). A meta-analysis of clinical trials of intravenous magnesium for prevention of new-onset atrial fibrillation after non-cardiac surgeries shows that it does not reduce the incidence significantly when compared with placebo ( 112778 ). However, there was a high risk of bias in the analysis, and variability in types of surgery, and the salt and dose of magnesium used. more Asthma. Parenteral magnesium sulfate can help to reverse severe acute asthma attacks and reduce the need for hospital admission. It is unclear if nebulized magnesium is beneficial for acute asthma attacks. However, oral magnesium does not seem to be beneficial. Overall, a single dose of intravenous magnesium seems to improve pulmonary function in acute asthma exacerbation and reduce the risk of hospitalization, particularly in patients with severe asthma, and those who have failed initial treatment with nebulized albuterol and intravenous corticosteroids ( 60888 , 90023 , 96483 , 104398 , 107365 ). The typical dose used for adults is 2 grams of magnesium sulfate infused over 20 minutes ( 15 ). For children, 25-75 mg/kg, to a maximum of 2 grams, infused over 20-30 minutes has been used ( 15 , 96483 , 107365 ). However, a post-hoc analysis of one large clinical trial ( 104400 ) designed to assess nebulized magnesium in children with acute asthma has found that adding IV magnesium to nebulized magnesium is associated with greater odds of hospitalization when compared with no IV magnesium ( 105919 ). This post-hoc analysis did not differentiate between precautionary and necessary hospitalizations. Although some clinical research and a meta-analysis in patients with acute asthma exacerbation show that nebulized magnesium in combination with standard treatment improves airway function, respiratory rate, and clinical asthma severity when compared with standard treatment alone, it is unclear whether these findings are clinically relevant ( 90016 , 113466 ). Most evidence, including larger clinical trials and meta-analyses, has not shown benefit of adjunct nebulized magnesium for acute asthma in adults or children ( 60888 , 90002 , 96484 , 104400 , 105920 , 113466 , 114674 ). Oral magnesium also does not seem to be beneficial. A meta-analysis of small clinical trials in children and adults with asthma shows that taking magnesium supplements orally does not improve lung function or reduce bronchodilator use when compared with control ( 104404 ). more Colorectal cancer. Increasing dietary magnesium intake seems to lower the risk of colon cancer but not rectal cancer. Epidemiological research shows that increased dietary magnesium intake is associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer, but the risk of rectal cancer is not affected ( 89387 , 90017 , 90027 , 101355 ). more Diabetes. Low dietary magnesium may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but evidence on the use of supplements for treating type 2 diabetes is conflicting. Higher dietary magnesium intake is associated with lower fasting insulin concentrations and a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults and obese children ( 13369 , 15548 , 96473 , 97486 , 98294 , 103736 , 105918 , 106920 ). In people with existing type 2 diabetes, hypomagnesemia is found in 25% to 38% of patients, especially in those with poorly controlled diabetes ( 1172 ). Population research in adults with type 2 diabetes also shows that a dietary magnesium intake of less than 250 mg daily is associated with a 56% higher risk of mortality. Preliminary subgroup analyses suggest that the risk of mortality is higher in those with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels above 7% ( 110051 ). A meta-analysis of small, heterogeneous clinical studies in adults with type 2 diabetes suggests that magnesium may modestly reduce HbA1C in patients with hypomagnesemia, but not in patients with normal magnesium levels, when compared with control ( 105075 ). Individual clinical studies using magnesium supplements in patients with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance have shown mixed results. Some research suggests magnesium supplements can decrease fasting blood glucose and improve insulin sensitivity, as well as reduce the risk of developing diabetes in high-risk patients ( 10664 , 12582 , 13376 , 60854 , 99313 , 106920 ), but other research shows no effect ( 1171 , 1172 , 13379 , 13380 , 112780 ). Discrepancies in these findings might reflect differences in magnesium salts and doses used, or differences in baseline magnesium status in study subjects. more Hypercholesterolemia. Magnesium may help improve lipid levels by a small amount in people with this condition. There is some evidence that taking magnesium oxide 1 gram orally daily for 6 weeks can produce small decreases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol levels, and small increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. However, magnesium does not seem to improve lipoprotein (a) levels ( 1193 ). Magnesium may also lower triglycerides in people with hypertriglyceridemia ( 97494 ). more Metabolic syndrome. Low dietary and serum levels of magnesium seem to be associated with the development of metabolic syndrome. Higher magnesium intake from diet and supplements is associated with a 27% lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome in healthy females ( 13371 ) and a 31% lower risk in healthy young adults ( 14304 ). Additional epidemiological research suggests that people with low serum magnesium levels are 6-7 times more likely to have metabolic syndrome than people with normal magnesium levels ( 13372 ). In a population analysis of over 6000 individuals without metabolic syndrome at baseline, the risk of developing this condition over a 6-year follow-up period was reduced by 16% in the highest quintile of dietary magnesium intake (median intake 371 mg daily) when compared with the lowest quintile (median intake 203 mg daily). Some, but not all, research suggests that the hazard ratio for metabolic syndrome in relation to magnesium intake may be U-shaped, with higher risk at intakes below about 150 mg daily and above 600 mg daily ( 108963 ). A combination of magnesium 20 mEq daily and potassium 40 mEq daily (magnesium potassium citrate) taken orally for 16 weeks reverses metabolic side effects of chlorthalidone, such as increased fasting plasma glucose and hypokalemia, more effectively than potassium chloride 40 mEq daily alone ( 112932 ). more Osteoporosis. Increased dietary and supplemental magnesium intake seems to increase bone mineral density and decrease bone loss in postmenopausal patients. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking magnesium hydroxide orally, 300-1800 mg daily for 6 months, then 600 mg daily for 18 months, or magnesium citrate orally 1830 mg daily for 30 days, might reduce bone loss and bone turnover in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis ( 9104 , 60928 ). Some epidemiological research also suggests that magnesium intake is related to increased bone mineral density ( 12501 , 12502 , 12503 , 12504 , 90014 ), although not all studies have found an association ( 12505 , 98286 ). more Postoperative pain. Injectable magnesium has been used with promising results for reducing pain and the need for other analgesics postoperatively. However, it is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for postoperative pain. A meta-analysis of 25 clinical trials shows that intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate, 5-50 mg/kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 6 mg/kg or 500 mg hourly during surgery, seems to reduce the 24-hour postoperative use of IV morphine by 24% when compared with placebo ( 19968 ). Adding IV magnesium sulfate 3.7-5.5 grams to patient-controlled analgesia for 24 hours after surgery has also been used ( 19968 ). Additionally, meta-analyses support that adjunctive IV or intrathecal administration of magnesium reduces post-operative pain scores, improves pain relief and sensory nerve block, and decreases the need for other analgesics, when compared with control ( 89390 , 90012 , 90015 , 98287 , 103728 , 114676 , 114677 , 114678 ). However, some data are conflicting. In a meta-analysis of 7 trials, IV magnesium was not associated with lower pain scores over the first 48 hours postoperatively. The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be explained by differences in magnesium regimens, anesthesia protocols, and surgical populations studied. Additionally, IV magnesium appears to be less effective than dexmedetomidine ( 105082 ). Two moderate-sized clinical studies in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty in China show that adding magnesium sulfate 2.5 mg/mL to the periarticular infiltration analgesia (PIA) cocktail or administering IV magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg before anesthesia induction then as a 15 mg/kg infusion during surgery reduces pain scores, increases comfort levels, limits and delays the use of postoperative opioids, prolongs analgesia, and reduces markers of inflammation when compared with the usual PIA cocktail or control ( 111181 , 113677 ). Administering magnesium intravenously also seems to be helpful for pain control after hysterectomy. A 3-gram IV bolus of magnesium sulfate followed by an infusion of 0.5 grams per hour for 20 hours has been used. Lower doses were not effective ( 6848 ). In males undergoing laparoscopic radical resection for gastrointestinal cancer, administering IV magnesium intraoperatively, as a loading dose of 40 mg/kg followed by 15 mg/kg/hour through the end of surgery, reduces postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort and analgesic requirements, when compared with placebo ( 112783 ). However, IV magnesium might not alleviate postoperative pain in children. Two small clinical studies show that administering a magnesium IV infusion does not reduce pain when compared with saline in children after tonsillectomy or after elective strabismus surgery ( 98282 , 105077 ). Oral magnesium has also been evaluated for postoperative pain. A small, single-center, clinical study in Thailand in adults undergoing oral surgery and taking postoperative ibuprofen shows that adding magnesium (Magnesium, Life Extension) 500 mg once prior to surgery and daily for 3 days post-surgery slightly improves self-reported pain at rest after 24 hours but not at other time points when compared with placebo ( 116617 ). These results are unlikely to be clinically significant. more Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Taking magnesium orally seems to relieve symptoms of PMS. There is some evidence that magnesium supplementation can improve symptoms, including mood changes and fluid retention, in some patients with PMS ( 1187 , 1188 , 6847 ). Doses used include magnesium oxide 333 mg daily for 2 menstrual cycles, or magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid equivalent to 360 mg elemental magnesium three times daily, from the 15th day of the menstrual cycle until onset of menstrual flow ( 1187 , 1188 ). Taking magnesium orally in a dose of 360 mg (elemental magnesium) three times daily for 2 months seems to prevent premenstrual migraine ( 1186 , 6847 ). A combination of magnesium 200 mg daily plus vitamin B6 50 mg daily seems to reduce anxiety-related premenstrual symptoms, including nervous tension, mood swings, irritability, and anxiety, when compared with placebo ( 8555 ). more Vasospastic angina. Intravenous magnesium seems to prevent coronary spasm in patients with this condition. Clinical research shows that administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate 65 mg/kg infused over 20 minutes dilates coronary arteries and suppresses acetylcholine-induced coronary spasms when compared with infusion of a dextrose solution in patients with vasospastic angina ( 8091 ). more Possibly Ineffective Altitude sickness. Taking magnesium citrate orally does not seem to reduce acute altitude sickness risk. Clinical research shows that taking magnesium citrate 1200 mg daily orally in three divided doses, beginning 3 days prior to mountain ascent and continuing until mountain descent, does not reduce the risk of acute altitude sickness when compared with placebo ( 60801 ). more Athletic performance. Taking magnesium orally does not seem to improve energy or endurance during athletic activity. Most evidence suggests that taking magnesium orally doesn't increase energy and endurance during athletic activity. Magnesium oxide, aspartate, and orotate salts do not seem to improve exercise performance when used alone or in combination with potassium, vitamin B6, or zinc ( 2825 , 2826 , 2828 , 2829 , 2830 , 60751 , 113655 ). more Bronchiolitis. Intravenous or nebulized magnesium is not beneficial in infants with this condition. Clinical research shows that administering a single IV dose of magnesium sulfate 100 mg/kg to infants with acute bronchiolitis does not improve, and may actually worsen, symptoms when compared with placebo ( 97482 ). A clinical study in infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis shows that adding nebulized magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg to nebulized epinephrine does not reduce hospital stay or the need for ventilator or oxygen support when compared with epinephrine alone ( 99317 ). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this use. more Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Research on the effects of intravenous infusions of magnesium and calcium for preventing oxaliplatin neurotoxicity are inconsistent, but higher quality studies seem to show no benefit. Pooled analyses of cohort studies and clinical trials show that calcium and magnesium infusions can decrease the incidence of severe oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity ( 90028 , 90029 , 90031 ). However, when only clinical trials are considered, the infusions do not appear to be helpful ( 90005 , 90029 , 90031 , 96474 , 96479 ). more Complex regional pain syndrome. Intravenous magnesium is not beneficial in complex regional pain syndrome type 1. Clinical research shows that receiving magnesium sulfate 70 mg/kg intravenously at the rate of 25 mL/hour for 4 hours each day for 5 days does not improve pain or level of impairment when compared with placebo in patients with chronic complex regional pain syndrome type 1 ( 89395 ). more Emergence delirium. The majority of small clinical studies in adults and children undergoing various surgeries suggest that intravenous (IV) magnesium doesn't reduce the risk of emergence delirium. However, most clinical studies in adults suggest that IV magnesium reduces emergence agitation. A small clinical study in adults undergoing surgery for endovascular aortic aneurysm repair shows that administering IV magnesium 30 mg/kg as a loading dose, followed by a 10 mg/kg/hour infusion for the duration of surgery, does not improve agitation or delirium scores when compared with administering saline ( 111182 ). Similarly, a small clinical study in children ages 2-5 years undergoing elective strabismus surgery shows that administering IV magnesium during anesthesia does not seem to prevent the occurrence of emergence delirium when compared with administering saline ( 105077 ). In a meta-analysis of 8 clinical trials in children aged 2-16 years undergoing general anesthesia for oral or ophthalmic surgery, giving IV magnesium as a 30 mg/kg loading dose followed by a 10 mg/kg/hour infusion, or as a single dose of 15-30 mg/kg, does not reduce emergence delirium scores, and may actually prolong emergence times ( 108729 ). However, there is some conflicting evidence. In patients undergoing radical mastectomy, giving intraoperative magnesium sulfate 30mg/kg over 1 hour, followed by 10 mg/kg/hour until the end of surgery, reduces emergence agitation (odds ratio 0.26) when compared with placebo ( 112781 ). more Menopausal symptoms. Oral magnesium oxide does not seem to be beneficial for menopausal hot flashes. A small, low quality study in postmenopausal patients with a history of breast cancer shows that taking magnesium oxide 400-800 mg orally daily reduces hot flashes when compared with baseline ( 102454 ). However, a larger, higher quality clinical study using magnesium oxide 800-1200 mg daily did not show any benefit when compared with placebo ( 98290 ). more Muscle cramps. Oral magnesium does not seem to improve muscle cramp frequency or intensity. Meta-analyses of small clinical trials show that magnesium supplementation for 3-6 weeks does not decrease the frequency or intensity of skeletal muscle cramps, whether the cramps are idiopathic or due to liver cirrhosis or pregnancy, when compared with placebo ( 90022 , 104395 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Oral magnesium does not seem beneficial for improving metabolic indices in patients with PCOS. A meta-analysis of moderate-quality clinical studies in Iran in patients with PCOS shows that taking magnesium 250 mg daily for 8-20 weeks does not improve glycemic indices, hormonal factors, lipid levels, or measures of body size (e.g., weight, waist circumference) when compared with placebo ( 116619 ) However, a clinical study, included in the above meta-analysis, shows that taking magnesium oxide orally, 250 mg daily for 10 weeks improves subjective measures of quality of life, fatigue, and emotional functioning, but not objective measures such as alopecia, abnormal uterine bleeding, or acne, when compared with placebo ( 108965 ). A clinical study using a combination of magnesium 250 mg with vitamin E 400 mg daily for 12 weeks shows a modest reduction in insulin resistance, insulin levels, and triglyceride levels, but not other lipid levels, when compared with placebo ( 100264 ). It is unclear if these beneficial effects are due to magnesium, vitamin E, or the combination. more Sickle cell disease. Intravenous magnesium does not add any benefit to standard therapy for sickle cell disease in children. Clinical research shows that giving magnesium sulfate 40-100 mg/kg (maximum of 2 grams per dose) intravenously every hour for 6-8 doses as an adjunct to standard therapy does not decrease hospital stay, pain, or opioid use, or improve quality of life, when compared with standard therapy and placebo in children with sickle cell disease ( 89399 , 98283 , 101356 ). Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this purpose. more Stillbirth. Magnesium administered during pregnancy does not reduce stillbirth risk. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that magnesium supplementation does not significantly decrease the risk of stillbirths when administered during pregnancy ( 60925 , 60978 ). more Tetanus. Intravenous magnesium sulfate does not seem to improve outcomes in patients with this condition. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intravenous magnesium sulfate does not reduce mortality when compared with placebo or diazepam in patients with tetanus ( 61020 ). While some research shows that magnesium reduces the duration of hospitalization and the need for ventilation when compared with diazepam ( 61170 ), magnesium does not seem to improve these outcomes when compared with placebo ( 60860 ). more Traumatic brain injury (TBI). Magnesium does not improve clinical outcomes in patients with moderate to severe TBI. Its effect in patients with concussions is unclear. A meta-analysis of four clinical trials shows that treatment with magnesium does not significantly improve neurological outcomes or reduce the risk of mortality when compared with placebo in patients with moderate to severe TBI ( 60905 ). A small observational cohort study in adolescents with concussions has found that adding oral magnesium 400 mg twice daily for 5 days to standard treatment with acetaminophen and ondansetron is associated with a trend toward reduced symptom severity when compared with standard treatment alone ( 104401 ). The validity of this study is limited by its observational nature and small cohort size. more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Alcohol use disorder. Intravenous magnesium does not seem to help reduce symptoms of alcohol withdrawal but may reduce the duration of alcoholic delirium. Preliminary clinical research shows that administration of four intramuscular injections of magnesium sulfate 2 grams at 6-hour intervals does not reduce symptoms of alcohol withdrawal when compared with saline ( 61063 ). A small observational study in patients with alcoholic delirium has found that administering magnesium sulfate IV 50 mg/kg every 8 hours, in addition to usual sedation, is associated with a reduction of delirium by approximately 2 days, or 4 days when given every 12 hours in addition to dexmedetomidine, when compared with usual sedation alone ( 111180 ). However, half of patients had hypomagnesemia at baseline; it is unclear if effects would be similar for patients with normal magnesium levels. Oral magnesium has not been evaluated for this purpose. more Allergic rhinitis (hay fever). Although there has been interest in using oral magnesium for allergic rhinitis, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of magnesium for this purpose. Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial in children with ADHD. Children with ADHD seem to have lower magnesium levels in their blood and hair ( 9969 , 100262 , 100263 ). A small clinical study in children aged 7-12 years with ADHD and magnesium deficiency shows that taking magnesium aspartate and lactate 6 mg/kg daily for 6 months might improve hyperactivity and magnesium levels when compared with control ( 1189 ). Another small clinical study in children with ADHD but without magnesium deficiency shows that taking magnesium 6 mg/kg daily along with vitamin D 50,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks may modestly improve emotional problems, but not inattention or hyperactivity, as measured on the strength and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), when compared with placebo ( 105914 ). more Back pain. It is unclear if oral or intravenous magnesium is beneficial for acute or chronic back pain in adults. One open-label clinical study in adults with acute low-back pain shows that taking magnesium 365 mg once daily in addition to taking etodolac 400 mg twice daily for 10 days does not further reduce pain when compared with taking etodolac alone ( 105913 ). Magnesium has also been tried for chronic back pain. A small clinical study in patients with chronic low-back pain shows that receiving magnesium sulfate 1 gram in 250 mL normal saline intravenously every 4 hours for 2 weeks, followed by magnesium gluconate 100 mg and magnesium oxide 400 mg by mouth daily for 4 weeks, reduces pain severity when compared with placebo ( 90035 ). It is unclear if oral magnesium used alone is beneficial. more Bariatric surgery complications. It is unclear if oral magnesium supplementation improves metabolic parameters after bariatric surgery. A retrospective study of over 3000 post-bariatric surgery patients suggests that those who take oral magnesium supplements providing 100-450 mg elemental magnesium daily may have improved metabolic parameters over 4 years of follow-up. When patients taking magnesium supplements were compared with those not taking supplements, 11% and 18% had type 2 diabetes, respectively, 30% and 42% had hypertension, respectively, and 16% and 23% had elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, respectively. For patients with hypomagnesemia at baseline, supplementation seemed to result in greater benefits ( 108968 ). more Bipolar disorder. Taking magnesium orally might improve manic symptoms in some people with bipolar disorder; however, it is unclear how it compares to current standard of care. One preliminary clinical study shows that magnesium 40 mEq daily (Magnesiocard) for 32 weeks has similar effects to lithium in up to 50% of patients treated for rapid cycling bipolar affective disorder ( 61022 ). Another preliminary clinical study shows that magnesium oxide 375 mg orally daily plus verapamil 80 mg taken four times daily reduces manic symptoms more effectively than verapamil alone in patients with mania ( 60742 ). more Cancer-related neuropathic pain. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium is beneficial for this condition. Single 500 mg to 1 gram doses of magnesium sulfate seem to relieve neuropathic pain for up to four hours when compared to baseline ( 6846 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Cardiac arrest. Intravenous magnesium does not seem to be helpful in cardiac arrest; however, the risk of sudden cardiac death seems to be inversely correlated to higher plasma magnesium levels or dietary intake. It is unclear if magnesium supplementation is associated with similar risk reduction. Administering magnesium intravenously doesn't seem to improve successful resuscitation in people with cardiac arrest ( 1190 ). However, higher plasma magnesium levels and higher dietary magnesium intake might reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death, possibly by protecting against fatal ventricular arrhythmias. In the Nurses' Health Study, the risk of sudden cardiac death was 77% lower in females with the highest quartile of plasma magnesium levels when compared with the lowest quartile. Also, the risk was 37% lower in females with the highest quartile of dietary magnesium intake when compared with the lowest quartile ( 17132 ). more Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence regarding the effect of dietary magnesium on CVD risk is conflicting. Epidemiological research in some populations shows that increased dietary magnesium intake is associated with decreased mortality due to strokes, coronary heart disease, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure, but other epidemiological research does not show any effect on these risks ( 89391 , 90003 , 90009 , 90030 , 90036 , 103735 ). Reasons for the discrepancies may be related to serum levels of magnesium at baseline, risk of cardiovascular disease at baseline, use of concomitant medications such as diuretics, or the presence of concomitant conditions such as kidney dysfunction. A population analysis conducted in Denmark has found that magnesium intake from drinking water may be associated with cardiovascular mortality. The overall risk of cardiovascular death and death due to stroke was reduced by 4% in the lowest 3 quintiles of intake when compared with the highest quintile. However, the risk of death due to acute myocardial infarction was increased by 22% in the lowest quintile when compared with the highest ( 108726 ). The relevance of these results is unclear, given that the main dietary source of magnesium is food rather than drinking water. more Chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial in pediatric patients at risk for cisplatin-induced febrile neutropenia. A small clinical study in children with solid tumors aged 9 years and older shows that taking magnesium 250 mg daily while receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy reduces febrile neutropenia by 47% and septic shock by 57% when compared with not receiving magnesium. Results from this study suggest that four pediatric patients need to take oral magnesium to avoid one case of febrile neutropenia ( 104394 ). more Chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium is beneficial for chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. A meta-analysis of several lower quality clinical studies in adults in Japan with cancer receiving cisplatin shows that pretreatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate 5 to 20 mEq reduces the odds of chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner when compared to standard hydration therapy ( 115726 ). The validity of these findings is limited by heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including types of cancer, definitions of nephrotoxicity, and use of other nephroprotective therapies. more Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Limited evidence suggests that magnesium may help improve CFS symptoms, but this is controversial. In people with low red blood cell magnesium, there is some evidence that intramuscular injections of 1 gram magnesium sulfate given once weekly for 6 weeks might improve CFS symptoms ( 7556 ). However, there is additional evidence that most patients with CFS have normal magnesium stores, and measurement of red cell magnesium is a poor indicator of total magnesium stores ( 7557 , 8084 , 8085 , 8086 , 8087 ). more Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Intravenous, but not nebulized, magnesium may be helpful in acute exacerbations of COPD. Administering magnesium sulfate intravenously, 1.2-2.5 grams over 20 minutes, might be helpful for treating acute exacerbations of COPD ( 1208 , 6844 , 103733 ). Also, giving magnesium sulfate 2 grams intravenously seems to improve exercise capacity when compared with placebo ( 89384 ). A meta-analysis of studies using intravenous magnesium sulfate for COPD exacerbations shows that it reduces hospital admission and mean length of stay and improves dyspnea scores when compared with placebo. Based on the relative risk identified in the included studies, seven patients would need to receive intravenous magnesium to prevent one hospitalization. However, intravenous magnesium sulfate does not change the need for non-invasive ventilation and the available research did not evaluate intensive care unit (ICU) admission ( 108967 ). Nebulized magnesium has also been evaluated. In patients experiencing a COPD exacerbation, clinical research shows that administering nebulized magnesium sulfate with albuterol three times at 30-minute intervals does not improve pulmonary function as measured by the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) when compared with placebo ( 89393 ). Also, a meta-analysis of a small number of low-quality studies shows that nebulized magnesium does not reduce hospital admission or the need for ventilatory support, although it might modestly improve dyspnea scores and reduce ICU admissions, when compared with placebo ( 108967 ). more Cluster headache. It is unclear if a single intravenous dose of magnesium sulfate is beneficial for cluster headaches. Administering magnesium sulfate intravenously, 1 gram over 5 minutes, seems to improve cluster headaches when compared with baseline( 1184 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Cognitive impairment. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for cognitive impairment. A large observational study in adults with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis suggests that serum magnesium levels of 20.2-22.3 mg/dL are associated with the lowest odds of mild cognitive impairment, while serum magnesium levels below and above that range of values are associated with increased odds of mild cognitive impairment ( 111695 ). more Coronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear if magnesium supplementation is beneficial for CHD. Clinical research shows that magnesium oxide 800-1200 mg daily for 3 months reduces platelet-dependent thrombosis by 35% when compared with placebo in patients with CHD ( 60759 ). It is unclear if this effect improves clinical outcomes. The effect of magnesium supplementation on coronary artery calcium has also been studied. A meta-analysis of 3 clinical studies in 196 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) shows that taking magnesium or increasing the concentration of magnesium in dialysate does not improve coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores when compared with standard therapy. However, magnesium reduced carotid intima-media thickness ( 111179 ). Similarly, a large clinical study in patients with CKD shows that taking slow-release magnesium hydroxide (Mablet, Denmark) 360 mg twice daily for 12 months does not slow the progression of CAC scores when compared with placebo ( 111178 ). This study may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between groups. more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for COVID-19. A small clinical study in patients hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 shows that taking magnesium 300 mg daily for the duration of hospitalization reduces the number of patients requiring oxygen therapy but not the duration of hospital stay when compared with placebo ( 114680 ). more Depression. It is unclear if magnesium is beneficial for the treatment or prevention of depression in adults. Some population research shows that dietary intake of elemental magnesium between 76-360 mg daily is associated with a reduced risk of depression, but there was no association with greater amounts of magnesium, and other population research shows no association at any intake level ( 96480 , 98289 ). For treatment of mild to moderate depression, one preliminary clinical study shows that taking magnesium chloride 2 grams orally daily for 6 weeks reduces depression scores by 56% and anxiety scores by about 52% when compared to baseline ( 96477 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. However, a small clinical study in adults with recurrent depression shows that taking magnesium aspartate 120 mg daily for 8 weeks, along with fluoxetine, does not improve depression scores when compared with patients taking fluoxetine and placebo ( 111185 ). Similarly, a very small crossover clinical study in adults with mild or moderate treatment-resistant depression shows that administering a single dose of IV magnesium sulfate 4 grams does not improve depression scores when compared with an infusion of 5% dextrose ( 96481 ). However, scores were evaluated 24 hours post-infusion which may be too soon to detect improvement. Guidelines from The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) and Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Taskforce state that elemental magnesium in doses of 100-400 mg is not recommended for adjunctive or monotherapy use in patients with depression ( 110318 ). more Diabetic foot ulcers. Oral magnesium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in patients with grade 3 diabetic foot ulcers shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg plus vitamin E 400 IU daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces ulcer size when compared with placebo ( 101436 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to magnesium, vitamin E, or the combination. more Exercise-induced muscle soreness. It is unclear if oral magnesium reduces muscle soreness in adults after resistance training. A very small study in healthy adults, ages 19-23, shows that taking magnesium glycinate 350 mg daily for 10 days seems to reduce muscle soreness after bench press exercise when compared with placebo ( 104399 ). more Fetal and premature infant mortality. It is unclear if antenatal intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate administration reduces the risk of fetal and premature infant mortality. Two meta-analyses of up to 7 clinical studies in patients at risk of preterm birth shows that antenatal IV magnesium sulfate administration does not reduce the risk of fetal or neonatal death when compared with placebo ( 114675 , 114681 ). more Fibromyalgia. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for this condition. A small clinical study shows that taking magnesium chloride orally 100 mg once daily for one month reduces mild to moderate, but not severe, stress associated with fibromyalgia when compared with placebo. It also reduces pain levels, but not to a clinically significant extent, and it does not affect sleep, fatigue, or quality of life ( 108964 ). Another small clinical study shows that taking magnesium citrate 300 mg daily for 8 weeks improves some symptoms of fibromyalgia, such as number of tender points and depression, when compared to baseline ( 89385 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Magnesium has also been evaluated in combination therapy. A small clinical study shows that taking a combination of magnesium hydroxide and malic acid (Super Malic tablets) orally decreases fibromyalgia-related pain and tenderness in some patients when compared with placebo ( 3262 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to magnesium, malic acid, or the combination. Additionally, a single-center, crossover clinical study in adults with fibromyalgia (primarily female patients) already receiving pharmacological therapy (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants) shows that taking a combination of magnesium 600 mg, coenzyme Q10, and tryptophan daily (Trimax 10, AS & NL) for 3 months does not improve self-reported fatigue when compared to baseline ( 116616 ). more Fractures. Population research suggests that higher intakes of magnesium may reduce fracture risk. Observational research has found that higher dietary and supplemental magnesium intake is associated with a 34% lower odds of fracture when compared with lower magnesium intake ( 101395 ). more Gastric cancer. Population research suggests that higher intakes of magnesium may reduce gastric cancer risk. Observational research has found that higher dietary and supplemental magnesium intake is not associated with a reduced risk for gastric cancer when compared with lower intake ( 103730 ). more Hearing loss. Oral magnesium may prevent and improve hearing loss due to environmental factors or loud noises. Clinical research in healthy military recruits shows that taking magnesium aspartate 167 mg daily for 2 months prevents hearing loss from exposure to loud noises during basic military training when compared with placebo ( 1205 ). Also, in patients with acute-onset hearing loss that was not caused by environmental factors, taking magnesium aspartate 167 mg daily for 8 weeks seems to improve hearing loss when compared with placebo ( 60813 ). more Hypertension. Oral magnesium supplementation may modestly reduce blood pressure, although these changes are not likely to be considered clinically significant. Most research shows that taking oral magnesium supplements in daily doses that are at least as high as the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults and up to 1000 mg daily can lower diastolic blood pressure by about 2 mmHg in adults with or without hypertension ( 1192 , 1199 , 9465 , 15165 , 18111 , 96482 ). Significantly lower doses do not seem to have this effect ( 1180 , 1195 , 1197 , 8098 ). The effect of magnesium on systolic blood pressure is conflicting. Two meta-analyses shows that taking magnesium 212-970 mg daily does not lower systolic blood pressure in patients with or without hypertension ( 15165 , 115728 ). However, additional meta-analyses show that taking magnesium 120-970 mg daily can lower systolic blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner by about 2-4 mmHg in patients with or without hypertension ( 18111 , 96482 ). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be due to heterogenous methods, including dose and duration among clinical studies. In 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified health claim stating that inconsistent and inconclusive evidence suggests that diets with adequate magnesium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure. Products bearing this claim must provide at least 84 mg of magnesium daily, but no more than 350 mg daily ( 107451 ). more Hypokalemia. It is unclear if intravenous or oral magnesium is beneficial for hypokalemia in patients with normal magnesium levels. A preliminary retrospective observational study in patients with hypokalemia and unknown serum magnesium levels has found that administering oral or intravenous magnesium is not associated with improved time to normalization of serum potassium levels when compared with no magnesium treatment ( 110049 ). However, hypokalemia with concurrent hypomagnesemia can impede potassium repletion and exacerbate hypokalemia-induced rhythm disturbances. Standard of care in patients with hypokalemia and known hypomagnesemia includes prompt treatment with magnesium ( 110063 ). more Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes). It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for prediabetes. Preliminary clinical research in patients with prediabetes shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg orally daily for 12 weeks does not improve fasting blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels when compared with placebo. Taking magnesium also did not affect blood pressure, body weight, triglyceride levels, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; however, it did modestly improve high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ( 110053 ). more Insomnia. Oral magnesium may modestly improve sleep complaints in adults, but evidence is conflicting. A meta-analysis of two small clinical studies in healthy older adults with or without insomnia suggests that taking magnesium reduces the time to fall asleep by an average of 17 minutes when compared with placebo ( 105917 ). However, it does not increase the time spent asleep. Also, these findings are limited by imprecision and a high risk of bias. Studies included in the analysis used elemental magnesium 500-729 mg daily (as magnesium oxide) for up to 8 weeks ( 102458 , 105917 ). Another small clinical study in patients with poor sleep quality and low magnesium status shows that taking elemental magnesium 320 mg (as magnesium citrate) in divided doses daily for 7 weeks does not improve sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), when compared with a sodium citrate placebo ( 102456 ). Magnesium has also been evaluated in combination with other ingredients. A very small crossover clinical study in patients aged 18-40 years without a sleep disorder shows that taking a combination of magnesium 300 mg, L-tryptophan 1000 mg, glycine 3000 mg, tart cherry 220 mg, and theanine 200 mg for 3 days reduces the time to fall asleep by about 24 minutes, increases total time asleep by about 22 minutes, and improves sleep efficiency, but does not improve the total time in bed or wakefulness after falling asleep when compared with cellulose placebo ( 111184 ). Another small crossover clinical study in adults with sleep disturbances shows that taking a combination of magnesium 200 mg and melatonin nightly for 4 weeks improves sleep quality, as measured by the PSQI, reduces the length of time it takes to fall asleep by about 17 minutes, and improves some other measures of sleep, such as sleep efficiency and number of awakenings, when compared with placebo. However, despite these improvements, overall sleep quality was still categorized as poor after the intervention ( 116160 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to magnesium, other ingredients, or the combination. more Intraventricular hemorrhage. It is unclear if antenatal intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate can reduce the risk for intraventricular hemorrhage in neonates. A meta-analysis of clinical research in premature infants shows that if the mother received antenatal intravenous magnesium sulfate, the infant had a non-significant trend toward a reduced risk of intraventricular hemorrhage when compared with infants whose mothers received placebo ( 103727 ). This analysis may have been insufficiently powered to detect a difference between groups. Another meta-analysis of up to 6 clinical studies, some of which are included in the previously referenced meta-analysis, in patients at risk of preterm birth shows that maternal antenatal (IV) magnesium sulfate administration does not reduce the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, but does reduce the risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage by about 24% when compared with placebo ( 114681 ). more Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). Taking magnesium orally may prevent the recurrence of kidney stones, although evidence is conflicting. Prophylactic treatment with magnesium hydroxide, 200 mg twice daily for one year, followed by 500 mg daily for another year, might decrease the recurrence rate of calcium stone formation ( 2007 ). However, magnesium oxide does not seem to benefit patients considered to be recurrent calcium stone formers when compared with placebo, no treatment, or chlorthalidone ( 8097 , 38501 , 61199 ). Magnesium oxide 300 mg in combination with vitamin B6 10 mg daily seems to decrease urinary oxalate levels in people with hyperoxaluria who have previously had kidney stones ( 1201 ), but it is unclear if this effect translates into a reduced incidence of kidney stones. more Liver cancer. Increased dietary magnesium intake is linked with a lower risk of liver cancer. Observational research in retired older Americans has found that higher dietary magnesium intake is associated with a 35% lower risk of liver cancer when compared with lower intake. This association was especially strong in persons who were moderate or heavy alcohol users ( 105080 ). more Lung cancer. Supplemental or dietary magnesium intake does not seem to reduce the risk of lung cancer. A large epidemiological cancer screening trial with a mean follow-up of over 12 years suggests there is no association between dietary or supplemental magnesium intake and the risk of lung cancer. However, dietary magnesium seems to play an important yet unclear role in lung cancer prevention when taken as part of the diet with alpha-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, lycopene, selenium, lutein, and zeaxanthin ( 112096 ). more Migraine headache. Oral magnesium may help prevent migraine in some adults and children. Also, intravenous magnesium may help treat migraine in adults, but evidence is conflicting. A meta-analysis of 4 low-quality clinical studies, in adults with migraine shows that magnesium 122-600 mg daily for 4-16 weeks modestly reduces migraine frequency and severity when compared with placebo( 115730 ). However, clinical significance is unclear, and the validity of these findings is limited by heterogeneous methods between clinical trials, including type of magnesium formulation and dose, patient population, and duration. In contrast, one small clinical study shows that taking magnesium does not reduce migraine frequency and severity by at least 50% in adults when compared with placebo ( 10661 ). Limited evidence suggests that adding oral magnesium to conventional treatment may also be beneficial. A clinical study in adults with migraine living in Iran shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg twice daily in addition to sodium valproate 200 mg twice daily for 12 weeks modestly reduces severity and duration of migraine, but not migraine frequency, when compared with taking sodium valproate alone ( 105915 ). It is unclear if these improvements would be considered clinically significant. For treatment of migraine, some adults with normal magnesium levels respond to intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate 1 gram over 5 minutes, but most patients who benefit have low magnesium levels at baseline ( 1185 , 6844 ). Effects of IV magnesium in patients with unknown magnesium levels are conflicting. Some preliminary clinical research shows that magnesium 1-2 grams IV alleviates acute migraine for up to 2 hours, but other research has found no benefit ( 89388 , 97493 , 98285 ). In children, treatment with magnesium oxide orally 15 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses for up to 16 weeks reduces the frequency and severity of migraine headaches when compared with placebo ( 10663 ). However, adding magnesium sulfate 400 mg orally daily to ibuprofen or acetaminophen does not further reduce migraine severity in children ( 89396 ). more Miscarriage. Oral magnesium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in pregnant adults with threatened miscarriage between the 6th and 13th week of gestation shows that taking a specific combination product (DAV HA, Lo.Li pharma s.r.l) containing magnesium 450 mg, alpha-lipoic acid, hyaluronic acidvitamin B6, and vitamin D daily in combination with conventional treatment of vaginal progesterone over 2 weeks of observation results in a faster resorption of the subchorionic hematoma and faster decrease of patient-reported vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and uterine contractions when compared with vaginal progesterone alone ( 113893 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to magnesium, other ingredients, or the combination. Additionally, the validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a placebo in the control group. more Myocardial infarction (MI). Research on the effects of intravenous or oral magnesium after myocardial infarction are conflicting. Administering magnesium intravenously doesn't seem to reduce mortality after an acute MI ( 8999 , 13357 , 13358 , 13359 , 13360 , 19990 , 60872 , 61082 ), although there is some conflicting evidence from a meta-analysis of clinical research that shows that intravenous magnesium sulfate may reduce short-term mortality by 55% when compared with placebo ( 60795 , 60895 ). Clinical research with oral magnesium supplementation has found no benefit ( 1198 , 6844 ). more Neonatal encephalopathy. Intravenous magnesium may improve short-term outcomes in neonates with encephalopathy. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intravenous magnesium may improve short term outcomes of neonatal encephalopathy (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, HIE). However, long term outcomes are not affected ( 90025 ). more Nocturnal leg cramps. It is unclear if oral magnesium is helpful for nocturnal leg cramps. Some clinical research in adults with nocturnal leg cramps shows that taking magnesium oxide 865 mg daily at bedtime for 4 weeks does not reduce the frequency of leg cramping episodes when compared with placebo ( 96478 ). However, four weeks may be too short a time to see a benefit. In other clinical research, taking oral magnesium oxide monohydrate 226mg daily at bedtime for 60 days reduces the frequency of leg cramps when compared with placebo. This reduction was not seen after 30 days. Magnesium also reduced cramp duration and improved sleep quality, but did not affect pain scores, at 60 days when compared with placebo ( 106919 ). more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral magnesium hydroxide has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking magnesium hydroxide 150 mg and L-carnitine 2000 mg daily for 16 weeks does not improve liver stiffness scores when compared with baseline or controls who took placebo for 8 weeks followed by this magnesium and L- carnitine combination for 8 weeks. Taking magnesium and L-carnitine also did not improve levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) when compared to baseline ( 111177 ). more Obesity. Evidence on the use of magnesium for weight loss in obese patients is conflicting; any benefit is likely small at best. A meta-analysis of 7 clinical studies in obese patients shows that taking magnesium reduces body mass index (BMI) by 0.3 when compared with control ( 103723 ). Another meta-analysis of 7 studies in obese patients shows that while magnesium supplementation does not reduce weight, it reduces waist circumference by 2 cm when compared with placebo ( 103729 ). Interestingly, subgroup analyses did not find that the dose of magnesium or baseline magnesium levels impacted effectiveness. One subgroup analysis found that magnesium supplementation lasting 12 weeks or less seemed to be more beneficial for obesity than supplementation lasting longer than 12 weeks ( 103723 ). more Osteoarthritis. Population research has not found a link between magnesium intake and osteoarthritis risk. Observational research has found that dietary and supplemental magnesium intake is not associated with the risk of developing osteoarthritis ( 101395 ). more Overall mortality. It is unclear if oral or IV magnesium reduces the risk of overall mortality. A meta-analysis of heterogeneous observational studies has found that increased dietary magnesium intake, but not supplemental magnesium intake, is associated with a modestly reduced risk of overall mortality ( 105073 ). A meta-analysis of 3 small, low-quality clinical studies in ICU patients shows that administering IV magnesium 24-30 mmol or as a target-directed dose for 3 days reduces overall mortality when compared with patients who did not receive magnesium ( 111290 ). However, some studies included patients with hypomagnesemia; it is unclear if effects would be similar for patients with normal levels of magnesium. more Pain (acute). It is unclear if locally injected or intravenous magnesium is helpful for acute pain. Preliminary clinical research in patients with renal colic shows that intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate, 50 mg/kg infused over 20 minutes, is as effective as IV morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg for controlling acute renal pain at 20 minutes after the dose ( 107367 ). Magnesium has also been evaluated in a dental procedure. A single-center clinical study in India in adults with irreversible pulpitis requiring a root canal shows that a local injection of 0.2 mL of 10% magnesium sulfate with lidocaine and epinephrine reduces perioperative pain when compared to lidocaine with epinephrine alone ( 115729 ). more Pain (chronic). Population research suggests that higher intakes of magnesium may modestly reduce the risk for chronic pain. A cross-sectional observational study has found that increased magnesium intake is associated with a 7% to 8% reduced risk for chronic pain. The association was found to be stronger in females than in males ( 103732 ). more Parturition. It is unclear if topical magnesium is beneficial for labor duration. A single-center clinical study in Iranian adults shows that applying 10 mL of a 50% magnesium sulfate solution directly to the cervix during the active phase of labor reduces the time to vaginal delivery by approximately 1.5 hours and improves the childbirth experience, as reported by patients, when compared with placebo. However, clinical significance is unclear ( 115727 ). more Perioperative anxiety. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for perioperative anxiety. Preliminary clinical research in adults undergoing open heart surgery shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg orally twice daily during hospitalization moderately improves anxiety and depression scores when compared with no magnesium therapy. Magnesium therapy was held for the 2 days immediately following surgery ( 110054 ). more Physical performance. Oral magnesium may modestly improve physical performance in otherwise healthy, elderly females. Clinical research in otherwise healthy elderly females shows that taking a magnesium oxide supplement (Easymag, Sanofi-Aventis) 900 mg daily for 12 weeks modestly improves walking speed and chair stand speed in elderly females when compared with no treatment ( 90026 ). more Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It is unclear if intravenous (IV) magnesium is beneficial for PONV due to mixed results from clinical research. A meta-analysis of 5 clinical studies in adults undergoing surgery with general anesthesia shows that administering IV magnesium sulfate intraoperatively reduces PONV ( 114676 ). However, a meta-analysis of 20 clinical studies in adults undergoing surgery with general anesthesia shows that administering IV magnesium perioperatively does not reduce the incidence of PONV ( 114678 ). A moderate-sized clinical study conducted in China in older adults undergoing total knee arthroplasty shows that administering intravenous magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg prior to anesthesia induction then 15 mg/kg during surgery reduces the incidence of postoperative vomiting but not postoperative nausea when compared with control ( 113677 ). The reasons for these discrepant findings are unclear but may be explained by differences in magnesium regimens, anesthesia protocols, and surgical populations studied. more Postoperative recovery. It is unclear if intravenous (IV) magnesium is beneficial for postoperative recovery. A moderate-sized clinical study conducted in China in older adults undergoing total knee arthroplasty shows that administering IV magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg prior to anesthesia induction then 15 mg/kg during surgery does not reduce extubation time, time spent in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), or duration of hospital stay when compared with control ( 113677 ). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 3 different clinical studies in adults undergoing surgery with general anesthesia shows that administering IV magnesium intraoperatively does not reduce extubation time ( 114676 ). more Postoperative sleep disturbance. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for postoperative sleep disturbances. Preliminary clinical research in adults undergoing open heart surgery shows that taking magnesium oxide 250 mg orally twice daily during hospitalization moderately improves sleep scores when compared with no magnesium therapy. Magnesium therapy was held for the 2 days immediately following surgery ( 110054 ). more Postoperative sore throat. It is unclear if topical magnesium sulfate is beneficial for preventing or treating sore throat pain after endotracheal intubation. Preliminary clinical research in patients undergoing endotracheal intubation for surgery shows that using a gargle containing magnesium sulfate 20% with lidocaine, 20 minutes before anesthesia induction, is less effective for reducing sore throat pain than a gargle containing dexmedetomidine and lidocaine ( 112779 ). The study did not include a comparison to lidocaine alone. Different preparations of magnesium have also been compared. A single-center clinical study in China in adults undergoing endotracheal intubation for elective surgery shows that applying a magnesium sulfate spray 15 mg/kg during intubation onto the pharyngeal area is non-inferior to a magnesium sulfate gargle 20 mg/kg used for 30 seconds 15 minutes prior to surgery in reducing the incidence of postoperative sore throat within 48 hours ( 116618 ). more Pregnancy-related leg cramps. It is unclear if oral magnesium reduces leg cramps during pregnancy; evidence is conflicting. One small clinical study in patients with pregnancy-related leg cramps shows that taking magnesium bisglycinate chelate 300 mg daily for 4 weeks reduces the frequency and intensity of leg cramps when compared with placebo ( 99318 ). A smaller clinical study in this population shows that taking a specific mixture of magnesium lactate and citrate (Nycoplus Magnesium) providing elemental magnesium 120 mg in the morning and 240 mg in the evening for 3 weeks reduces the frequency of cramps when compared with placebo ( 1194 ). However, not all research agrees. One small clinical study using this same supplement and dose for 2 weeks found no benefit when compared with placebo ( 17463 ). It is possible that a 2-week duration of treatment is too short to be beneficial. Finally, a meta-analysis of these studies and one other more recent clinical study shows that taking magnesium does not reduce the frequency or improve the resolution of pregnancy-related leg cramps when compared with placebo ( 105916 ). This analysis may not have been adequately powered to detect a difference between treatment groups. more Pre-procedural sedation. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium is beneficial when administered in addition to other medications used for sedation during surgery. A moderate-sized study of adults aged 65-79 years old undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) shows that administering a single intravenous bolus of magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg prior to the procedure reduces intraoperative propofol requirements by about 21% and reduces some peri-procedural adverse events including the incidence of respiratory depression and involuntary movement when compared with control. However, there were no differences in recovery time, hemodynamic parameters, or the incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, perioperative nausea or vomiting, lethargy, or arrythmias ( 111694 ). Another moderate-sized study in older adults undergoing total knee arthroplasty shows that administering intravenous magnesium sulfate 40 mg/kg prior to anesthesia induction then 15 mg/kg during surgery does not reduce the need for medications used for anesthesia induction, intraoperative maintenance propofol requirements, or recovery time when compared with control. However, magnesium sulfate does seem to reduce the amount of remifentanil required for intraoperative anesthesia maintenance and increase norepinephrine requirements when compared with control ( 113677 ). more Preterm labor. The use of magnesium sulfate to inhibit uterine contractions in preterm labor (tocolysis) is controversial. However, its use for the purpose of fetal neuroprotection for up to 48 hours is supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. Magnesium is given intravenously (IV) during preterm labor in an effort to improve fetal neurological outcomes, such as to reduce the risk of cerebral palsy and motor dysfunction in the infant ( 60915 , 60927 , 60931 , 61001 , 97485 , 103734 , 103754 , 114681 ). The typical dosage of magnesium sulfate is 4 grams infused IV over 10-30 minutes, followed by a maintenance infusion of 1-4 grams/hour for 48 hours or until birth. Use beyond 5-7 days has been associated with hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the fetus ( 15 , 12590 , 12594 ). Some meta-analyses of clinical research suggest that magnesium sulfate is more effective at delaying delivery by 48 hours when compared with oxytocin receptor blockers, nitrates, beta-mimetics, and/or placebo ( 20263 , 61021 ). However, an additional meta-analysis of several clinical studies shows that magnesium sulfate 4 or 6 grams IV is not more effective at delaying preterm labor by 48 hours when compared with nifedipine ( 115639 ). The reason for these discrepant findings are unclear, but may be related to the heterogenous methods between clinical trials, including dose and duration. more Restless legs syndrome (RLS). It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for RLS. Some observational research has found that hypomagnesemia is associated with RLS; however, not all research agrees ( 8096 , 9472 ). Preliminary clinical research in adults with RLS who are beginning treatment with pramipexole shows that also taking magnesium oxide 250 mg orally daily for 2 months moderately improves RLS scores and sleep quality scores when compared with pramipexole and placebo ( 110052 ). Other low-quality clinical research in adults with RLS or periodic limb movement during sleep shows that taking magnesium 12.4 mmol orally in the evening for 4-6 weeks decreases movement and increases sleep when compared with baseline ( 9466 ). The validity of this finding is limited by the lack of a comparator group. more Sarcopenia. It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for the prevention or treatment of sarcopenia. Population research in older adults has found that lower dietary intake of magnesium is associated with sarcopenia. However, the effect of magnesium supplementation on sarcopenia prevention or treatment has not been evaluated ( 110055 ). Magnesium has been evaluated in combination with other ingredients for treatment of sarcopenia. A small clinical study in elderly individuals with sarcopenia undergoing a diet and exercise program shows that taking a combination supplement containing magnesium 300 mg, carnosine, hydroxymethylbutyrate, lactoferrin, and sodium butyrate daily for 4 months increases muscle mass, as measured by the skeletal muscle index, and improves measures of muscle function, including handgrip muscle strength, chair test, and walking speed, when compared with placebo ( 114682 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to magnesium, other ingredients, or the combination. more Sepsis. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium is beneficial for sepsis. A very large observational study in patients with sepsis and hypomagnesaemia or normomagnesemia in the intensive care unit (ICU) suggests that administering intravenous magnesium sulfate 2 or 4 grams within 24 hours of admission reduces 28-day all-cause mortality from 25% in patients who did not use magnesium sulfate to 20% in those who were administered magnesium sulfate, regardless of baseline serum magnesium level and other baseline characteristics. Administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate in this population may also reduce ICU mortality by 4%, in-hospital mortality by 3%, and the use of renal replacement therapy by 3% but also seems to increase the length of ICU and hospital stay when compared with patients who did not use magnesium sulfate ( 113676 ). The validity of these results is limited by the observational nature of the study. more Sleep deprivation. Oral magnesium has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A very small clinical study in sleep-deprived recreational athletes shows that taking a combination of magnesium 1350 mg, zinc 90 mg, and vitamin B6 31.5 mg for 3 nights at bedtime does not change sleep quality, subjective sleepiness, mood, or fatigue the next day when compared with placebo ( 113655 ). more Stroke. Increased dietary magnesium may decrease stroke risk, and using a magnesium-containing salt substitute may improve neurological performance post-stroke. However, intravenous magnesium has not demonstrated benefit. Most population research has found that increased dietary intake of magnesium is associated with decreased stroke risk and decreased mortality from stroke ( 9001 , 9002 , 90013 , 90030 , 90036 , 92107 , 103736 ). In patients who have had a stroke, a preliminary clinical study shows that using a salt substitute providing the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) of magnesium and potassium for 6 months improves neurological performance when compared with using regular salt ( 97491 ). However, intravenous (IV) magnesium does not seem to be beneficial in patients who have had a stroke. Large prospective clinical trials show that IV magnesium given within 12 hours of acute stroke does not reduce mortality or disability in most patients when compared with placebo. However, one subgroup analysis suggested that IV magnesium might benefit patients with lacunar (non-cortical) stroke ( 13361 , 90021 ). IV magnesium also doesn't seem to reduce cardiovascular complications after acute stroke. A secondary analysis of a clinical trial in patients after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke shows that giving IV magnesium does not reduce serious cardiac adverse events when compared with placebo ( 104393 ). Another secondary analysis of this trial shows that giving IV magnesium prior to arrival at the hospital and within 2 hours of a hemorrhagic stroke does not reduce hematoma volume on hospital arrival, hematoma expansion during hospital admission, or functional outcomes at 3 months ( 108733 ). more Subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intravenous magnesium sulfate may reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in people with subarachnoid hemorrhage, but evidence is conflicting. There is mixed evidence regarding the effect of magnesium sulfate in managing aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. One meta-analysis of clinical research shows that intravenous magnesium sulfate 64-144 mmol/day for 10-18 days reduces the risk of poor outcomes following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, including death, vegetative state, or dependency, by 46% when compared with control ( 60932 ). Also, meta-analyses of clinical research show that intravenous magnesium reduces the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia by 27% when compared with placebo ( 60944 , 89398 ). However, these results were not confirmed in other meta-analyses ( 60973 , 90034 ). more Thrombocytopenia. It is unclear if intravenous magnesium sulfate is beneficial in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Addition of intravenous magnesium sulfate as a 6-gram loading dose followed by 6 grams infused over 24 hours for 3 days, to standard treatment for TTP does not reduce the time to normalization of the platelet count, the incidence of TTP-related organ dysfunction, or the recurrence rate, when compared with standard treatment alone ( 112777 ). This study may have been underpowered to detect a difference. more Urinary incontinence. Although there has been interest in using oral magnesium for urinary incontinence, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of magnesium for this purpose. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) . It is unclear if oral magnesium is beneficial for PXE. Preliminary clinical research in patients with PXE shows that taking magnesium oxide 800 mg (500 mg of elemental magnesium) twice daily for one year tends to reduce calcification of elastic skin fibers when compared with placebo, but the effect is not statistically significant ( 101393 ). This study was limited by small size and insufficient power to detect smaller effects. more More evidence is needed to rate magnesium for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Oral magnesium is safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 350 mg daily ( 7555 ). ...when used parenterally and appropriately. Parenteral magnesium sulfate is an FDA-approved prescription product ( 96484 ). Possibly Unsafe when used orally in excessive doses. Doses greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 350 mg daily frequently cause loose stools and diarrhea ( 7555 ). CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Magnesium is safe when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 65 mg daily for children 1 to 3 years, 110 mg daily for children 4 to 8 years, and 350 mg daily for children older than 8 years ( 7555 , 89396 ). ...when used parenterally and appropriately ( 96483 ). CHILDREN: Likely Unsafe when used orally in excessive doses. Tell patients not to use doses above the tolerable upper intake level (UL). Higher doses can cause diarrhea and symptomatic hypermagnesemia including hypotension, nausea, vomiting, and bradycardia ( 7555 , 8095 ). PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Likely Safe when used orally and appropriately. Magnesium is safe for those pregnant and breast-feeding when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 350 mg daily ( 7555 ). PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Possibly Safe when prescription magnesium sulfate is given intramuscularly and intravenously prior to delivery for up to 5 days ( 12592 , 89397 , 99354 , 99355 ). However, due to potential adverse effects associated with intravenous and intramuscular magnesium, use during pregnancy is limited to patients with specific conditions such as severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. There is some evidence that intravenous magnesium can increase fetal mortality and adversely affect neurological and skeletal development ( 12590 , 12593 , 60818 , 99354 , 99355 ). However, a more recent analysis of clinical research shows that increased risk of fetal mortality seems to occur only in the studies where antenatal magnesium is used for tocolysis and not for fetal neuroprotection or pre-eclampsia/eclampsia ( 102457 ). Furthermore, antenatal magnesium does not seem to be associated with increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants ( 104396 ). There is also concern that magnesium increases the risk of maternal adverse events. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that magnesium sulfate might increase the risk of maternal adverse events, especially in Hispanic mothers compared to other racial and ethnic groups ( 60971 , 99319 ). PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Possibly Unsafe when used orally in excessive doses. Tell patients to avoid exceeding the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 350 mg daily. Taking magnesium orally in higher doses can cause diarrhea ( 7555 ). ...when prescription magnesium sulfate is given intramuscularly and intravenously prior to delivery for longer than 5 days ( 12592 , 89397 , 99354 , 99355 ). Maternal exposure to magnesium for longer than 5-7 days is associated with an increase in neonatal bone abnormalities such as osteopenia and fractures. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that magnesium injection not be given for longer than 5-7 days ( 12590 , 12593 , 60818 , 99354 , 99355 ).",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: General : For preventing deficiency, the daily Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for elemental magnesium should be followed. For males: 400 mg for ages 19-30 years, 420 mg for ages 31 years and older. For females: 310 mg for ages 19-30 years, and 320 mg for ages 31 years and older. For pregnant females: 400 mg for ages 14-18 years, 350 mg for ages 19-30 years, and 360 mg for ages 31-50 years. For lactating females: 360 mg for ages 14-18 years, 310 mg for ages 19-30 years, 320 mg for ages 31-50 years ( 7555 ). Therapeutic doses of magnesium vary widely. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Intravenous / Intramuscular:Magnesium sulfate is typically used intravenously, short-term for acute management of symptoms. Typical loading doses range from 4-14 grams IV, and can be followed by 2.5-5 grams every 4 hours IM, or a continuous IV infusion of 0.5-3 grams/hour. Children Oral: For preventing deficiency, the daily Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for elemental magnesium should be followed. For all children: 80 mg for ages 1-3 years, 130 mg for ages 4-8 years, 240 mg for ages 9-13 years. For males: 410 mg for ages 14-18 years. For females: 360 mg for ages 14-18 years. For pregnant females age 14-18 years, 400 mg; for lactating females age 14-18 years, 360 mg. For infants 0-6 months of age, the adequate intake (AI) level is 30 mg. For infants 7-12 months of age, the AI is 75 mg. For therapeutic uses, research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Standardization & Formulation Magnesium supplements used varied in composition, by the particular salt used in the formulation (aspartate, oxide, pidolate, and orotate) or by other confounding ingredients (multi-vitamin as magnesium source) ( 60751 ). Other salts of magnesium include citrate, chloride, lactate citrate, and gluconate. Supplement manufacturers of magnesium/calcium combination products promote a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio as being ideal for absorption of these elements. However, there is no credible research to support this claim. Products such as coral calcium that claim to have ideal combinations of magnesium and calcium to cure a variety of diseases and conditions have come under scrutiny of the FDA and FTC ( 12508 ).",
  "interactions_text": "Expand All | Collapse All AMINOGLYCOSIDE ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Concomitant use of aminoglycoside antibiotics and magnesium can increase the risk for neuromuscular weakness. Both aminoglycosides and magnesium reduce presynaptic acetylcholine release, which can lead to neuromuscular blockade and possible paralysis. This is most likely to occur with high doses of magnesium given intravenously ( 13362 ). more ANTACIDS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Use of acid reducers may reduce the laxative effect of magnesium oxide. A retrospective analysis shows that, in the presence of H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), a higher dose of magnesium oxide is needed for a laxative effect ( 90033 ). This may also occur with antacids. Under acidic conditions, magnesium oxide is converted to magnesium chloride and then to magnesium bicarbonate, which has an osmotic laxative effect. By reducing acidity, antacids may reduce the conversion of magnesium oxide to the active bicarbonate salt. more ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Theoretically, magnesium may have antiplatelet effects, but the evidence is conflicting. In vitro evidence shows that magnesium sulfate inhibits platelet aggregation, even at low concentrations ( 20304 , 20305 ). Some preliminary clinical evidence shows that infusion of magnesium sulfate increases bleeding time by 48% and reduces platelet activity ( 20306 ). However, other clinical research shows that magnesium does not affect platelet aggregation, although inhibition of platelet-dependent thrombosis can occur ( 60759 ). more BICTEGRAVIR/EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE (Biktarvy) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Magnesium might decrease levels of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide by reducing its absorption. Advise patients that bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide should be taken at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after magnesium containing products ( 116930 ). more BISPHOSPHONATES Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonquantitative systematic review) Magnesium can decrease absorption of bisphosphonates. Cations, including magnesium, can decrease bisphosphonate absorption. Advise patients to separate doses of magnesium and these drugs by at least 2 hours ( 13363 ). more CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Magnesium can have additive effects with calcium channel blockers, although evidence is conflicting. Magnesium inhibits calcium entry into smooth muscle cells and may therefore have additive effects with calcium channel blockers. Severe hypotension and neuromuscular blockades may occur when nifedipine is used with intravenous magnesium ( 3046 , 20264 , 20265 , 20266 ), although some contradictory evidence suggests that concurrent use of magnesium with nifedipine does not increase the risk of neuromuscular weakness ( 60831 ). High doses of magnesium could theoretically have additive effects with other calcium channel blockers. more DIGOXIN Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Magnesium salts may reduce absorption of digoxin. Clinical evidence suggests that treatment with oral magnesium hydroxide or magnesium trisilicate reduces absorption of digoxin from the intestines ( 198 , 20268 , 20270 ). This may reduce the blood levels of digoxin and decrease its therapeutic effects. more GABAPENTIN (Neurontin) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence UNLIKELY Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Gabapentin absorption can be decreased by magnesium. Clinical research shows that giving magnesium oxide orally along with gabapentin decreases the maximum plasma concentration of gabapentin by 33%, time to maximum concentration by 36%, and area under the curve by 43% ( 90032 ). Advise patients to take gabapentin at least 2 hours before, or 4 to 6 hours after, magnesium supplements. more KETAMINE (Ketalar) Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence D (Anecdotal evidence) Magnesium might precipitate ketamine toxicity. In one case report, a 62-year-old hospice patient with terminal cancer who had been stabilized on sublingual ketamine 150 mg four times daily experienced severe ketamine toxicity lasting for 2 hours after taking a maintenance dose of ketamine following an infusion of magnesium sulfate 2 grams ( 105078 ). Since both magnesium and ketamine block the NMDA receptor, magnesium is thought to have potentiated the effects of ketamine. more LEVODOPA/CARBIDOPA (Sinemet) Interaction Rating Major Do not take this combination. Severity HIGH Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Nonrandomized clinical trial) Magnesium can reduce the bioavailability of levodopa/carbidopa. Clinical research in healthy volunteers shows that taking magnesium oxide 1000 mg with levodopa 100 mg/carbidopa 10 mg reduces the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by 35% and of carbidopa by 81%. In vitro and animal research shows that magnesium produces an alkaline environment in the digestive tract, which might lead to degradation and reduced bioavailability of levodopa/carbidopa ( 100265 ). more POTASSIUM-SPARING DIURETICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Potassium-sparing diuretics decrease excretion of magnesium, possibly increasing magnesium levels. Potassium-sparing diuretics also have magnesium-sparing properties, which can counteract the magnesium losses associated with loop and thiazide diuretics ( 9613 , 9614 , 9622 ). Theoretically, increased magnesium levels could result from concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics and magnesium supplements. more QUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (Theoretical based on pharmacology) Magnesium decreases absorption of quinolones. Magnesium can form insoluble complexes with quinolones and decrease their absorption ( 3046 ). Advise patients to take these drugs at least 2 hours before, or 4 to 6 hours after, magnesium supplements. more SEVELAMER (Renagel, Renvela) Interaction Rating Minor Be watchful with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence POSSIBLE Level of Evidence B (Clinical cohort study) Sevelamer may increase serum magnesium levels. In patients on hemodialysis, sevelamer use was associated with a 0.28 mg/dL increase in serum magnesium. The mechanism of this interaction remains unclear ( 96486 ). more SKELETAL MUSCLE RELAXANTS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence A (High-quality meta-analysis (quantitative systematic review)) Parenteral magnesium alters the pharmacokinetics of skeletal muscle relaxants, increasing their effects and accelerating the onset of effect. Parenteral magnesium shortens the time to onset of skeletal muscle relaxants by about 1 minute and prolongs the duration of action by about 2 minutes. Magnesium potentiates the effects of skeletal muscle relaxants by decreasing calcium-mediated release of acetylcholine from presynaptic nerve terminals, reducing postsynaptic sensitivity to acetylcholine, and having a direct effect on the membrane potential of myocytes ( 3046 , 97492 , 107364 ). Magnesium also has vasodilatory actions and increases cardiac output, allowing a greater amount of muscle relaxant to reach the motor end plate ( 107364 ). A clinical study found that low-dose rocuronium (0.45 mg/kg), when given after administration of magnesium 30 mg/kg over 10 minutes, has an accelerated onset of effect, which matches the onset of effect seen with a full-dose rocuronium regimen (0.6 mg/kg) ( 96485 ). In another clinical study, onset times for rocuronium doses of 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 mg/kg were 86, 76, and 50 seconds, respectively, when given alone, but were reduced to 66, 44, and 38 seconds, respectively, when the doses were given after a 15-minute infusion of magnesium sulfate 60 mg/kg ( 107364 ). Giving intraoperative intravenous magnesium sulfate, 50 mg/kg loading dose followed by 15 mg/kg/hour, reduces the onset time of rocuronium, enhances its clinical effects, reduces the dose of intraoperative opiates, and prolongs the spontaneous recovery time ( 112781 , 112782 ). It does not affect the activity of subsequently administered neostigmine ( 112782 ). more SULFONYLUREAS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MILD Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence B (Lower quality RCT) Magnesium increases the systemic absorption of sulfonylureas, increasing their effects and side effects. Clinical research shows that administration of magnesium hydroxide with glyburide increases glyburide absorption, increases maximal insulin response by 35-fold, and increases the risk of hypoglycemia, when compared with glyburide alone ( 20307 ). A similar interaction occurs between magnesium hydroxide and glipizide ( 20308 ). The mechanism of this effect appears to be related to the elevation of gastrointestinal pH by magnesium-based antacids, increasing solubility and enhancing absorption of sulfonylureas ( 22364 ). more TETRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTICS Interaction Rating Moderate Be cautious with this combination. Severity MODERATE Occurrence PROBABLE Level of Evidence D (In vitro or animal study) Magnesium decreases absorption of tetracyclines. Magnesium can form insoluble complexes with tetracyclines in the gut and decrease their absorption and antibacterial activity ( 12586 ). Advise patients to take these drugs 1 hour before or 2 hours after magnesium supplements. more",
  "mechanism_text": "General Magnesium (Mg) is a component of many compounds. It is the seventh most abundant element in the earth's crust by mass. It occurs in magnesite, dolomite, and in mineral waters ( 90051 ). Magnesium is well absorbed from foods ( 12587 ). Foods that are high in fiber are generally high in magnesium ( 13382 ). Dietary sources of magnesium include legumes, whole grains, vegetables (especially broccoli, squash, and green leafy vegetables), seeds, and nuts (especially almonds). Other sources include dairy products, meats, chocolate, and coffee. Water with a high mineral content, or \"hard\" water, is also a source of magnesium. Dietary intake of magnesium may be low, particularly among females ( 8088 , 12504 , 12505 ). Analgesic effects Magnesium is reported to be an antagonist at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are involved in the potentiation of pain. This effect and magnesium's depressant effects on nerves and smooth muscle are thought to contribute to the possible effects of magnesium in relieving symptoms associated with migraine headaches, postoperative pain, neuropathic pain, erythromelalgia, Raynaud's Phenomenon, and other vascular disorders and pain syndromes ( 6846 , 6848 , 8094 ). Magnesium might play a role in migraine headache. Low levels of magnesium may induce cerebral arterial vasoconstriction, increase platelet aggregation and promote serotonin release, and potentiate the vasoactive properties of serotonin ( 6844 , 12388 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Magnesium deficiency has been reported to be a trigger for inflammatory processes. A meta-analysis of 17 clinical trials comparing the effects of various magnesium salts, 250-500 mg daily for 4-26 weeks, on inflammatory markers shows that magnesium significantly decreases serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and increases nitric oxide (NO) levels when compared with placebo. However, it does not affect levels of serum interleukin (IL)-6, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione (GSH), or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha ( 108727 ). Antidiabetic effects There is some evidence that magnesium plays a role in diabetes and metabolic syndrome ( 1168 , 1183 ). In clinical research, oral magnesium has been reported to improve glycemic control in some patients with type 2 diabetes ( 1197 , 15548 , 60854 , 61032 , 96473 ). Low magnesium levels are associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and obesity ( 13369 , 13372 , 105918 ). Poorly controlled diabetes can cause enhanced osmotic diuresis and increase urinary loss of magnesium ( 13381 ). In severe hyperglycemia, tubular reabsorption of magnesium is decreased and may result in lower magnesium levels secondary to increased excretion ( 13365 ). Autonomic neuropathy and related autoimmune gastric atrophy may reduce intestinal absorption of magnesium. Also, insulin can increase magnesium excretion ( 13381 ). However, in patients with reasonably well-controlled type 2 diabetes, dietary magnesium absorption and retention don't appear to be impaired. Lower serum levels may be related to lower dietary intake ( 13375 ). Magnesium seems to affect glucose control and insulin homeostasis. Magnesium blood levels might play a role in insulin resistance ( 1168 , 6844 , 14304 , 17133 ). Insulin is involved with the shift of magnesium intracellularly. In turn, intracellular magnesium seems to regulate insulin activity on oxidative glucose metabolism. Low intracellular magnesium causes disorders in tyrosine kinase activity at the insulin receptor level, which results in decreased insulin sensitivity and insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Magnesium is also thought to enhance the action of enzymes involved in glucose utilization ( 13365 , 17133 ). Antioxidant effects Magnesium has antioxidant effects that can be reduced by calcium ( 61106 ). Cardiovascular effects Magnesium is known to be essential for all ATPase activity, including facilitating movement of calcium across and within the cell membrane of cardiac and vascular tissues ( 60920 ). In patients with congestive heart failure, there is evidence magnesium reduces coronary vascular resistance, increases coronary artery blood flow, has antiarrhythmic effects, and improves cardiac indexes ( 8088 ). There is interest in using magnesium for preventing endothelial function decline, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular events. A meta-analysis of preliminary clinical research suggests that taking magnesium for at least 6 months improves endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in patients who are unhealthy, over 50 years of age, or overweight ( 102455 ). There is also interest in the effects of magnesium on arterial stiffness, which is a predictor of coronary heart disease and stroke. In overweight adults, taking magnesium 450 mg daily as the citrate, oxide, or sulfate salts for 24 weeks does not affect arterial stiffness, measured by the carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity, when compared with placebo ( 108730 ). There is some evidence that magnesium is important in regulating blood pressure ( 1170 , 1182 ). Magnesium deficiency has been found to increase intracellular concentrations of sodium and potassium, which can lead to increased peripheral resistance and vasospasm ( 8088 ). In cell membranes, a decreased concentration of magnesium and increased calcium to magnesium ratio has also been associated with hypertension ( 8092 ). There is also some evidence that hypertensive patients with hypomagnesemia usually require more antihypertensive medications than hypertensive patients with normal magnesium levels ( 8088 ). Reduced intracellular magnesium also causes an increase in intracellular calcium. In addition to contributing to insulin resistance, higher intracellular calcium levels enhance calcium-mediated vasoconstriction, and inhibit cardiac and smooth muscle relaxation ( 13365 ). This increased vascular tone can increase blood pressure. There is some evidence that serum magnesium deficiency might play a role in both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke ( 8998 ). Deficiency Magnesium deficiency is not uncommon in the US. It's particularly prevalent among African Americans and the elderly. Low intake and impaired absorption of magnesium have also been associated with the development of various disease states such as osteoporosis, hypertension, atherosclerotic vascular disease, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, and stroke ( 8088 , 8099 , 8998 , 9001 , 12510 , 12511 ). Hypomagnesemia is usually asymptomatic. The serum magnesium level is the most commonly used test to assess magnesium status. However, it is also known that the serum magnesium level is depressed only in cases of severe magnesium deficiency and that it poorly correlates with body magnesium ( 8089 ). The body preserves serum magnesium at the expense of magnesium in cells and bone, so serum levels may appear normal in magnesium deficiency ( 12510 , 12511 ). Red cell and urine magnesium levels also have been used but they are also poor indicators of body magnesium ( 8085 , 8089 ). The intravenous magnesium loading test is considered to be a more reliable test to measure magnesium status. However, the test is cumbersome and requires full participation from the patient. It is known that serum magnesium actually consists of three fractions. They are protein-bound, complexed, and free ionic magnesium. It is the free ionic magnesium that is biologically active. Whether the serum magnesium level is low or normal, free ionic magnesium levels have been shown to vary with many disorders such as cardiac disease, stroke, diabetes, and migraines. In recent years, instruments have become available that measure free ionic magnesium, allowing for a more accurate assessment of body magnesium. However, measurement of ionized magnesium may not be readily available in labs outside the research setting ( 8090 ). Symptoms of severe magnesium deficiency include convulsions; confusion; muscle weakness; abnormal muscle movements such as tremors, myoclonus, and tetany; and arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, and torsades de pointes ( 403 , 13383 ). Long-term magnesium deficiency might increase the risk of arrhythmias and the rate of developing atherosclerosis ( 13383 ). Gastrointestinal As antacids, magnesium salts work by reacting with gastric acid to form magnesium chloride. Magnesium hydroxide has the fastest onset of action, magnesium carbonate is slower due to its crystal structure, and magnesium trisilicate has the slowest onset and longest duration due to its poor solubility ( 6844 ). The laxative effects and diarrhea produced by magnesium salts are due to the osmotic effects of unabsorbed salts in the intestine and colon, and stimulation of gastric motility due to the release of gastrin and cholecystokinin ( 6844 ). Hormonal effects Intracellular levels of magnesium, measured in erythrocytes and leukocytes, have been found to be lower in females with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), leading to the use of magnesium supplements for PMS ( 6847 ). Oral magnesium has been reported to benefit mood changes associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) ( 1187 ). Supplementation of thyroid hormone to hypothyroid animals restored magnesium levels and transport. Therefore, thyroid hormones may have an effect on magnesium homeostasis ( 60899 ). Immune effects In clinical research, magnesium has been shown to decrease plasma cortisol levels ( 2826 ). Additional research suggests low serum magnesium is related to low-grade chronic inflammation. Hypomagnesemia is associated with elevated serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and C-reactive protein (CRP), which has been linked to metabolic syndrome ( 13366 ). Magnesium intake inversely correlates with CRP levels: females with high dietary magnesium intake have lower levels of CRP, which may reduce cardiovascular disease risk. The relationship is strongest in overweight or obese females (BMI >25) and current or past smokers ( 13369 ). Other epidemiological research in adults has found that consuming less that the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for magnesium is associated with a 1.48 to 1.75 times higher risk of having an elevated CRP. In adults over age 40 with a BMI >25, consumption of less than 50% of the RDA for magnesium correlates with a 2.24 times higher risk of elevated CRP ( 13371 , 13373 ). However, it is unclear if magnesium supplementation reduces CRP levels. One meta-analysis of 18 clinical trials including 927 patients with various conditions shows that supplemental magnesium does not reduce CRP levels when compared with placebo ( 105921 ). The included studies were not designed to assess CRP levels or baseline magnesium status, limiting the validity of this finding. Muscular effects Extracellular magnesium is critical to both maintaining nerve and muscle electrical potentials and transmitting impulses across neuromuscular junctions ( 272 ). The inhibitory effect of magnesium on preterm labor contractions (tocolysis) is attributed to antagonism of calcium-mediated myometrial contractions ( 6844 ). Oral magnesium has been reported to reduce the incidence of pregnancy-related leg cramps which may be associated with lower serum magnesium levels ( 1194 ). Magnesium was also found to be effective in preventing succinylcholine-induced muscle twitching, which is an adverse effect of patients undergoing general anesthesia ( 60834 ). Neurological effects Extracellular magnesium is critical to both maintaining nerve and muscle electrical potentials and transmitting impulses across neuromuscular junctions ( 272 ). Preliminary evidence shows magnesium may act as a neuroprotective agent in patients diagnosed with acute stroke. Several possible mechanisms of neuroprotection exist, including noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism and calcium channel antagonism ( 9000 , 9003 ).Magnesium levels also appear to be lower in acute attacks of paranoid schizophrenia ( 12584 ). In animal research, magnesium has been shown to have neuroprotective effects ( 60986 ). It was shown to prevent post-hypoxic brain injury by blocking the excess release of glutamate in the calcium channel. Fetal and newborn brains appear to be more susceptible to damage from glutamate release; therefore, blocking glutamate receptors through agents such as magnesium may reduce the risk of injury in the perinatal period. However, clinical studies to date have not shown a definite fetal neuroprotective benefit from prenatal administration of magnesium to pregnant patients, although prenatal magnesium therapy may improve motor function in early childhood for infants born prematurely ( 114681 ). The role of magnesium in the prevention or control of convulsions may involve blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the release of acetylcholine at the motor nerve terminals ( 61006 ). The mechanism of action for magnesium in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia is not clear. There is some evidence that magnesium dilates blood vessels in the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce ischemia. Contrary to this view are indications that magnesium may decrease CNS blood flow ( 9473 ). Additionally, magnesium may have anticonvulsant actions in eclampsia due to depression of neuromuscular transmission, direct depressant effect on smooth muscle, and CNS depression ( 6844 ). There is interest in using magnesium for improving symptoms of insomnia and other sleep disturbances. In a small clinical study in elderly patients with primary insomnia, magnesium intake increased levels of melatonin and reduced levels of cortisol, which might contribute to improved sleep ( 102458 ). Additionally, low magnesium levels have been linked to poor sleep quality and also to electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities during slow wave sleep. Magnesium has been theorized to regulate sleep by reducing inflammation, oxidative stress and by activating N-methyl-D-aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors ( 102456 ). Otic effects Oral magnesium treatment has been shown to reduce the incidence of temporary and permanent noise-induced hearing loss. It is hypothesized that magnesium may improve permanent hearing threshold shifts (NIPTS) ( 1205 , 60813 ). Pulmonary In asthma, intravenous administration of magnesium might cause bronchodilation ( 2003 , 60889 ). Renal effects There is some evidence that magnesium metabolism is a factor in renal stone formation and prevention ( 2006 , 2007 ). There is preliminary evidence that magnesium can reduce hypertension and nephrotoxicity induced by cyclosporine. Magnesium supplementation appears to reduce the thickening of the renal vascular walls that may occur with cyclosporine therapy; potassium supplementation may increase the effectiveness of magnesium for this use ( 9500 ). Skeletal effects Magnesium is important for normal bone structure ( 272 ), and plays an essential role in more than 300 cellular reactions ( 945 ). Magnesium is required for the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and is involved in ion movements across cell membranes ( 945 ). It is involved in protein synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism ( 272 ). Magnesium deficiency increases the formation and activity of osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells). Magnesium deficiency causes increases in substance P and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in bone, which increase osteoclastic bone resorption. Increased bone resorption causes release of magnesium as well as calcium from bone. Since magnesium is an essential nutrient, the body may sacrifice bone in times of deficiency as a magnesium source to maintain homeostasis ( 12499 , 12500 ). Magnesium deficiency might be a risk factor for postmenopausal osteoporosis, but its exact role is unknown ( 7555 ). Magnesium, like calcium, is regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH). In humans, severe to moderate magnesium deficiency commonly causes hypocalcemia. Normally, magnesium deficiency increases PTH activity. PTH increases renal calcium reabsorption, increases phosphate excretion, and increases renal magnesium reabsorption. Impaired parathyroid hormone (PTH) activity and impaired response to PTH seem to be the predominant reasons that magnesium-deficient people are also hypocalcemic ( 12499 ). However, clinical research shows that magnesium sulfate 350 mg taken daily by mouth for 3 weeks does not affect calcium blood levels in patients with hypoparathyroidism taking maintenance therapy of calcium and a vitamin D analog ( 90010 ). Clinical research suggests that magnesium, alone or in combination with calcium, vitamin D, and zinc, reduces bone turnover ( 60928 , 60934 , 60950 ). In combination with calcium, vitamin D, and other minerals, magnesium increases bone density ( 36840 ). Magnesium supplementation in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis results in decreased serum iPTH and urinary deoxypyridinoline and increased serum osteocalcin ( 60928 , 60950 ).",
