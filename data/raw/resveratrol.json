Intranasal resveratrol seems to be beneficial for reducing allergic rhinitis symptoms in adults and children. Some clinical research shows that intranasal resveratrol with carboxymethyl-beta-glucan can improve symptoms of allergic rhinitis ( 91332 , 97339 ). One clinical study in adults with allergic rhinitis shows that using an intranasal spray containing resveratrol 0.1% three times daily for 4 weeks reduces nasal symptoms and improves quality of life scores when compared with placebo ( 97339 ). A study in children aged 4-17 years with pollen-induced allergic rhinitis shows that using an intranasal spray containing resveratrol 0.05% three times daily for 2 months improves itching, sneezing, runny nose, and nasal obstruction and reduces use of rescue medication when compared with placebo ( 91332 ). more Obesity. Oral resveratrol seems to be beneficial for weight loss in individuals with overweight or obesity. However, it is unlikely to be beneficial for improving most metabolic parameters in this population. A meta-analysis of 28 clinical trials shows that taking resveratrol modestly decreases body weight by 0.5 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 0.17 kg/m2, and waist circumference by 0.8 cm when compared with placebo or no intervention. This analysis included studies of individuals with normal weight, overweight, and obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or other chronic conditions. A subgroup analysis suggests that individuals with obesity have a greater response to resveratrol. In these individuals, taking resveratrol 8-3000 mg daily resulted in an average weight reduction of 1.15 kg and a BMI reduction of 0.3 kg/m2 when compared with placebo. The greatest impact on body weight and BMI occurred with resveratrol doses of no more than 500 mg daily and treatment durations of at least 3 months ( 100696 ). However, it is unclear whether any improvements are clinically significant. more Possibly Ineffective Cardiovascular disease (CVD). Oral resveratrol does not seem to be beneficial for CVD prevention. Population research suggests that a higher dietary intake of resveratrol is not associated with a reduced risk of CVD when compared with a lower dietary intake ( 91334 ). Also, a meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking resveratrol for up to 6 months does not improve any measures of plasma lipids, including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides in patients at high risk for CVD ( 91333 ). While one preliminary clinical study shows that taking resveratrol 10 mg daily for 3 months improves left ventricular function by about 1% and endothelial function when compared to baseline in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease, the improvements are very small and blood pressure and markers of inflammation do not appear to be improved ( 91330 ). more Hypercholesterolemia. Oral resveratrol does not seem to be beneficial for hypercholesterolemia. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that resveratrol is unlikely to be beneficial for improving blood lipids when compared with placebo in patients with hypercholesterolemia. In the meta-analysis, studied populations included people who are overweight or obese, as well as patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), angina, and dyslipidemia ( 105181 ). Although there was a small reduction in total cholesterol levels of approximately 7 mg/dL, resveratrol did not improve levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or triglycerides ( 105181 ). Also, an analysis of results from clinical research shows that taking resveratrol for up to 6 months does not improve any measures of plasma lipids, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or triglycerides in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease ( 91333 ). Also, clinical research in healthy humans shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg orally daily for 30 days increases levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B ( 112944 ). Another meta-analysis identified more promising results; however, any effect on blood lipids may not be considered clinically significant. This meta-analysis included 17 clinical studies enrolling 968 participants with dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, overweight or obesity, or stroke. Resveratrol reduced total cholesterol by approximately 10 mg/dL, LDL by approximately 6 mg/dL, and triglycerides by approximately 9 mg/dL, but did not improve HDL, when compared with placebo. However, most of the included studies were small and utilized heterogenous dosing regimens, with doses ranging from 10-3000 mg daily for 4-48 weeks ( 110020 ). more Metabolic syndrome. Oral resveratrol does not seem to be beneficial for metabolic syndrome. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking resveratrol does not improve blood pressure when compared with placebo in patients with metabolic syndrome or related disorders ( 102513 ). A similar meta-analysis shows that taking resveratrol does not improve levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, or liver enzymes. There was a small reduction in total cholesterol levels of approximately 7 mg/dL ( 105181 ). However, only 3-4 of the papers included in these meta-analyses, which included 28-31 publications, evaluated patients with metabolic syndrome. The remainder included patients with related conditions, such as overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The mainly small or preliminary clinical studies that did evaluate patients with metabolic syndrome all show that taking resveratrol 100-1000 mg daily for 12-16 weeks does not improve blood pressure, glucose control, or plasma lipids ( 91331 , 95828 , 102513 , 105181 ). However, one preliminary clinical trial shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg three times daily for 3 months reduces body weight by about 4 kg, body mass index (BMI) by 1.3 kg/m2, fat mass by 2.4 kg, and waist circumference by 4 cm when compared to baseline ( 91331 ). The validity of these findings is limited by the lack of a comparator group. Also, a moderate-sized clinical trial of adults with metabolic syndrome shows that taking resveratrol 300 mg and delta-tocotrienols 500 mg daily for 24 weeks improves body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, total and HDL cholesterol, and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress when compared with placebo ( 112144 ). It is unclear if these effects are due to resveratrol, delta-tocotrienols, or the combination. more Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Oral resveratrol does not seem to be beneficial for most metabolic symptoms of NAFLD. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for improving steatosis. Although some individual studies disagree, meta-analyses reviewing 4-6 preliminary clinical studies show that taking resveratrol does not affect liver enzyme levels, insulin resistance, blood pressure, blood lipids, body mass index (BMI), or abdominal size when compared with placebo in patients with NAFLD ( 95826 , 99048 , 105184 ). Most trials have studied doses of 300-3000 mg daily for 2-3 months; one study used resveratrol 500 mg 3 times daily for 6 months ( 95826 , 98911 , 99048 , 105184 ). However, one meta-analysis shows that taking resveratrol might have a small effect on levels of the inflammatory mediators C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha ( 105184 ). It is not clear if resveratrol might reduce steatosis in patients with NAFLD. One preliminary clinical study shows that taking resveratrol 3000 mg daily in two divided doses for 8 weeks does not improve steatosis when compared to baseline in males with NAFLD ( 91327 ). However, another preliminary clinical study in adults with NAFLD shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg daily for 3 months, while following an energy-balanced diet and exercising, improves steatosis, but not fibrosis, insulin resistance, lipid levels, or body composition, when compared with lifestyle modifications alone ( 91328 ). The difference in these findings might be due to small study sizes, the duration of therapy, or the gender of the included patients. more Insufficient Reliable Evidence to Rate Acne. It is unclear if topical resveratrol is beneficial for acne. Preliminary clinical research shows that applying a gel containing trans-resveratrol 1 mcg per gram to facial skin for 60 days reduces the severity of acne by about 54%, compared to only 6% for control gel ( 71064 ). more Age-related cognitive decline. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for age-related cognitive decline. One small clinical study shows that taking resveratrol 75 mg twice daily for 14 weeks modestly improves cognitive performance and memory after menopause, but not executive function or learning, when compared with placebo ( 95827 ). Another small clinical study in healthy, older adults shows that taking resveratrol 200 mg daily for 26 weeks improves memory retention, but not delayed recall or word recognition, when compared with placebo. In this study, resveratrol capsules were formulated to also contain 320 mg of quercetin to enhance the absorption of resveratrol ( 102511 ). It is unclear if resveratrol alone would result in similar effects. Despite these positive results, conflicting research exists. A small clinical study in sedentary, overweight, elderly adults shows that taking resveratrol 300 mg daily for 90 days does not improve measures of cognitive function such as psychomotor speed, attention, executive function, learning, or memory when compared with placebo. Taking a higher dose of 1000 mg daily for 90 days modestly improves psychomotor speed, but no other cognitive measures, in these patients ( 98907 ). Another small clinical study in healthy elderly adults shows that taking resveratrol 200 mg daily for 26 weeks does not improve verbal memory when compared with placebo ( 98909 ). more Aging skin. Although there has been interest in using oral resveratrol for aging skin, there is insufficient reliable information about the clinical effects of resveratrol for this purpose. Alzheimer disease. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for improving symptoms of Alzheimer disease. A meta-analysis of small clinical studies in patients with Alzheimer disease shows that taking resveratrol or trans-resveratrol up to 500 mg daily for 12 to 52 weeks improves the ability to perform activities of daily living but does not change cognitive function when compared with placebo ( 114517 ). more Beta-thalassemia. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for beta-thalassemia. A small clinical study in patients with beta-thalassemia intermedia shows that taking micronized trans-resveratrol (Xian Tianxingjian Natural Bio-Products CO., LTD) 2000 mg with piperine (Bioprex Co.) 40 mg, with or without hydroxyurea 8-15 mg/kg, daily for 6 months does not improve hemoglobin levels or affect the need for blood transfusion when compared with taking placebo with or without hydroxyurea ( 98908 ). more Cancer. It is unclear if dietary resveratrol is beneficial for cancer prevention. Population research has found that a higher dietary intake of resveratrol is not associated with a reduced risk of cancer when compared to lower dietary intake ( 91334 ). more Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking a combination of resveratrol 10 mg, vitamin C 180 mg, zinc 15 mg, and flavonoids 160 mg daily for 20 days followed by 10 days without supplementation, repeated for three cycles, modestly reduces symptoms of cough and sputum production in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD when compared with control ( 71130 ). It is not clear if these effects are due to resveratrol, the other ingredients, or the combination. more Cognitive function. Oral resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in healthy young adults shows that taking a specific supplement (Transmax by BiotiviaTM) containing trans-resveratrol 500 mg and piperine 10 mg daily for 28 days does not improve most measures of cognitive performance when compared with placebo ( 95834 ). more Cognitive impairment. Oral resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Preliminary clinical research in a small number of patients with mild cognitive impairment shows that taking resveratrol 200 mg and quercetin 350 mg daily for 26 weeks does not improve learning and memory performance when compared with placebo ( 102512 ). However, given the small sample size, it is possible this study was inadequately powered to detect significant changes in these cognitive measures. more Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for COVID-19. A small clinical trial in outpatients with COVID-19 shows that taking resveratrol (Vita-Age) 1 gram four times daily, for 7-15 days based on symptom duration, does not reduce the rate of hospitalization, emergency room visits, or pneumonia when compared with placebo. All patients also received a single dose of Vitamin D3 ( 109164 ). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect differences between groups. more Diabetes. Some research shows that oral resveratrol is beneficial for improving glycemic indices in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, more research is needed to determine the most effective dose or the patient population most likely to benefit. Although results from individual clinical studies have been mixed ( 91329 , 95825 , 95832 , 100695 , 109165 , 109167 , 109170 ), meta-analyses of clinical research show that resveratrol modestly reduces blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in patients with diabetes. Studies lasted 4-24 weeks and many included patients treated with antidiabetes medications, including metformin. However, these meta-analyses have yielded differing findings regarding effective doses ( 91329 , 109165 , 109167 , 109170 ). One meta-analysis of clinical research in individuals aged 45 years and older shows that doses of 250-1000 mg daily modestly reduce levels of fasting blood glucose, insulin, and HbA1c, as well as insulin resistance, when compared with placebo. Doses of up to 250 mg daily are generally ineffective, and only one study used doses greater than 1000 mg daily. Although sub-analyses suggest that these benefits may be limited to individuals aged 45-59 years, the number of studies in older individuals is small and findings are unclear ( 109165 ). A second meta-analysis in adults with type 2 diabetes suggests that resveratrol doses of at least 500 mg daily were necessary for reducing levels of fasting blood glucose and insulin, as well as insulin resistance ( 109167 ). A third meta-analysis, which also included Chinese language publications, shows that doses of resveratrol of at least 1000 mg daily are needed for improved glycemic control ( 109170 ). Some studies have used a specific resveratrol product (Biotivia Bioceuticals, International SrL) ( 95825 ). Although the reasons for discrepancies between individual clinical trials are not clear, it is possible that conflicting results are related to baseline blood glucose control. Resveratrol has shown benefit in patients with diabetes that is not well-controlled at baseline (HbA1c of 8% or higher) ( 91329 ), while results are mixed in patients with diabetes that is at least moderately well-controlled prior to supplementation (HbA1c of 7% or lower) ( 95825 , 100695 ). It is also possible that the differences may relate to the technique used to measure outcomes. For instance, resveratrol appears to improve insulin resistance when measured by the Stumvoll insulin sensitivity index, but not by the gold-standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique ( 95832 ). Resveratrol has also been evaluated for improving blood pressure, blood lipid, and liver transaminase levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Meta-analyses of clinical trials show that resveratrol has a small, but likely clinically insignificant, effect on systolic blood pressure when compared with placebo. Two meta-analyses show similar findings for diastolic blood pressure; however, some research suggests that any benefits are limited to doses of at least 500 mg daily ( 102513 , 109167 , 109170 ). Most meta-analyses of clinical research show that resveratrol does not improve blood lipid levels ( 105181 , 109167 , 109170 ) or liver transaminase levels ( 105181 ) when compared with placebo. Other clinical research in patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes shows that taking resveratrol 1000 mg daily for 8 weeks does not affect hepatic steatosis or cardiovascular risk indices when compared with placebo ( 109169 ). more Diabetic nephropathy. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for diabetic nephropathy. Preliminary clinical research in patients with diabetic nephropathy shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg plus losartan 12.5 mg daily for 90 days can reduce urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios, but not serum creatinine levels or glomerular filtration rates, when compared with taking placebo and losartan. When compared to baseline, the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio decreased by 46 mg/gram with resveratrol and increased by 25 mg/gram with placebo ( 100695 ). more Hypertension. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for lowering blood pressure. A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that resveratrol is unlikely to be beneficial for improving systolic or diastolic blood pressure when compared with placebo in patients with hypertension. In the meta-analysis, studied populations included people who are overweight or obese, as well as patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), stroke, and dyslipidemia ( 102513 ). More research is needed in patients with hypertension. more Migraine headache. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for treating migraine headache. A small clinical crossover study in patients with hormonal migraine headaches shows that taking resveratrol (Veri-te Resveratrol, Evolva SA) 75 mg twice daily for 3 months does not affect headache frequency, severity, or disability when compared with placebo ( 109166 ). However, this study did not include a wash-out period between treatments, introducing the potential for carry-over effects. more Mitochondrial myopathies. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for increasing exercise tolerance in patients with mitochondrial myopathies. A very small clinical trial in adults with mitochondrial myopathies shows that taking resveratrol (Veri-te resveratrol) 500 mg twice daily for 8 weeks does not improve exercise capacity when compared with placebo ( 109162 ). This study may have been inadequately powered to detect differences between groups. more Osteoarthritis. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for osteoarthritis. A clinical study in adults with knee osteoarthritis shows that taking oral resveratrol 40 mg twice daily for 1 week then 20 twice mg daily for 6 months does not improve knee pain, function, or use of rescue medications when compared with placebo ( 115962 ). However, another clinical study in patients with mild or moderate knee osteoarthritis receiving physical therapy and meloxicam 15 mg daily shows that adding resveratrol 500 mg daily for 90 days improves pain, function, and stiffness when compared with adding placebo ( 98910 ). The discrepancy in findings between these studies may be due to differences in resveratrol formulation and dosing, concurrent medications allowed, or study populations. More research is needed to determine if resveratrol, alone or as adjunctive therapy, provides benefit for knee osteoarthritis. more Osteopenia. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for improving bone mineral density (BMD). A meta-analysis of clinical research shows that taking resveratrol at doses of up to 1500 mg daily for 1-12 months does not increase BMD or alter bone biomarkers when compared with placebo ( 109163 ). The studies in this meta-analysis included various populations, such as postmenopausal or overweight individuals, or patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. However, a clinical study in healthy, postmenopausal females shows that taking fermented soy 200 mg, containing resveratrol 25 mg and equol 10mg, orally daily for 12 months increases whole-body BMD when compared with placebo. Levels of markers of bone formation, including osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, are increased, and the level of deoxypyridinoline, a marker of bone resorption, is decreased ( 112942 ). more Periodontitis. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for periodontitis. A small clinical study in individuals with chronic moderate-to-severe periodontitis who recently received non-surgical treatment for periodontitis shows that taking resveratrol 480 mg daily for 4 weeks improves plaque index when compared with placebo, but resveratrol does not seem to improve other markers of periodontitis, including pocket depth, bleeding index, clinical attachment loss, or salivary markers of inflammation ( 112135 ). The study may have been inadequately powered and too short in duration to detect a difference between the groups. more Peritoneal dialysis. It is unclear if oral resveratrol can improve outcomes with peritoneal dialysis. One clinical study shows that taking trans-resveratrol 150 mg or 450 mg daily for 12 weeks increases ultrafiltration rate and volume when compared with placebo in patients on peritoneal dialysis. The effect appears to be dose-dependent ( 95830 ). more Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for PCOS. Clinical research in patients with PCOS shows that taking resveratrol 1000 mg daily for 3 months results in a regular menstruation cycle length in 77% of individuals, compared with 52% of those taking placebo. The occurrence of hair loss was reduced by about 50%; however, there was no effect on hormone, metabolic, or lipid profiles. There was also a small increase in fat mass and decrease in fat-free mass, although the clinical relevance of these changes is unclear ( 109131 ). A small clinical trial in adults with PCOS shows that taking micronized trans-resveratrol (RevGenetics) 1500 mg daily for 3 months decreases levels of testosterone, but does not improve weight, lipid levels, insulin sensitivity, acne, or hirsutism, when compared with placebo ( 95823 ). A meta-analysis of 4 controlled trials of resveratrol, taken orally in doses of 800-1500 mg daily for 40 days to 3 months, shows reductions in levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate when compared with placebo, but no effect on follicle stimulating hormone, prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone, C-reactive protein, insulin, sex hormone binding globulin, lipids, acne, or pregnancy rates ( 112943 ). more Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for RA. A small clinical study shows that adding resveratrol 1 gram orally once daily as adjunct therapy to antirheumatic drugs for 2 months reduces the number of tender and swollen joints, as well as biomarkers of inflammation. It is not known whether resveratrol reduces joint damage when assessed using conventional radiography. Also, the most effective combination of resveratrol and antirheumatic drug is not known, since the patients in this study were taking different antirheumatic drugs at variable doses ( 95706 ). more Sciatica. Oral resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. Clinical research in patients with sciatica secondary to a herniated disk shows that taking a combination of resveratrol 50 mg with alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, and cholecalciferol orally once daily for 30 days, concurrently with a physiotherapy protocol, reduces pain and disability, and improves quality of life when compared with the physiotherapy protocol alone ( 112933 ). It is unclear if the effects are due to resveratrol, other ingredients, or the combination. more Ulcerative colitis. It is unclear if oral resveratrol is beneficial for ulcerative colitis. Preliminary clinical research shows that taking trans-resveratrol (Sumabe Company) 500 mg daily for 6 weeks reduces subjective measures of disease activity and improves quality of life measures when compared with placebo in patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis ( 95831 ). However, a small clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate active ulcerative colitis shows that taking resveratrol (VeNatura Resveratrol Supplement) 250 mg twice daily for 8 weeks, while following the Mediterranean diet, is not more effective for improving ulcerative colitis symptom severity than following the Mediterranean diet without supplemental resveratrol ( 113339 ). more Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Intranasal resveratrol has only been evaluated in combination with other ingredients; its effect when used alone is unclear. A small clinical study in preschool children with recurrent wheezing following URTI, but without atopy, shows that using an intranasal solution containing resveratrol 0.05% and carboxymethyl-beta-glucan 0.33% (Linfovir Plus, Noos srl, Rome, Italy) 3 times daily for 7 days starting with the onset of upper respiratory symptoms reduces wheezing days and episodes but not the incidence of URTI when compared with placebo ( 115961 ). It is unclear if this effect is due to resveratrol, carboxymethyl-beta-glucan, or the combination. more More evidence is needed to rate resveratrol for these uses.",
  "safety_text": "Likely Safe when used in amounts found in foods ( 2030 ). Possibly Safe when taken orally in doses of up to 1500 mg daily for up to 3 months ( 71066 , 71097 , 91328 , 91331 , 95825 , 95833 , 98910 , 100695 , 105183 , 109163 , 109167 ).

CHILDREN: Likely Safe when used in amounts found in foods. CHILDREN: Possibly Safe when used as an intranasal spray for up to 2 months in children 4 years of age and older ( 91332 ). There is insufficient reliable information available about the safety of resveratrol when used by mouth in larger amounts as medicine. PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: Likely Safe when used in amounts found in foods ( 2030 ). Resveratrol is found in grape skins, grape juice, wine, and other food sources. However, wine should not be used as a source of resveratrol during pregnancy and lactation.",
  "dosing_text": "Adult Oral: Resveratrol has most often been used in doses of 250-1000 mg daily for up to 3 months. See Effectiveness section for condition-specific information. Theoretically, consuming resveratrol with a high-fat meal might inhibit the absorption of resveratrol ( 71042 ). Intranasal:Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Topical: Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Children Research is limited; typical dosing is unavailable. Standardization & Formulation Resveratrol has been administered in clinical research orally, topically, and intranasally. One intranasal spray used in a clinical trial was prepared as an isotonic solution containing resveratrol 0.05% extracted from Hu Zhang ( 91332 ). Similarly, some oral resveratrol products have been prepared with resveratrol isolated from Hu Zhang ( 91327 , 109164 ).",

  "mechanism_text": "General Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound that exists in nature as cis- and trans- stereoisomers. Trans-resveratrol appears to be the primary active form. Resveratrol is primarily found in red wine, red grape skins, purple grape juice, mulberries, and in smaller amounts in peanuts ( 513 , 2030 , 2956 ). Trans-resveratrol is also found in blueberries and bilberries. Raw blueberry and bilberry fruit may contain higher concentration of some constituents compared to cooked fruit. Heating blueberries or bilberries for 18 minutes at 190°C results in a loss of 17% to 46% of resveratrol content due to degradation ( 16053 ). Other sources of resveratrol include eucalyptus (Eucalyptus wandoo, Eucalyptus sideroxylon), spruce (Picea excelsa), and Bauhinia racemosa ( 2030 ). Polygonum cuspidatum (Hu Zhang), the roots of which are used in Chinese and Japanese traditional medicine, is considered to be one of the richest sources of trans-resveratrol ( 2030 , 15154 ). The trans-resveratrol content of wine is highly dependent on grape type, climate, and practices used to make the wine. White wines have very low trans-resveratrol concentrations. They have only about 1% to 5% the quantity found in red wines ( 15154 ). Pinot noir consistently has the highest concentrations of trans-resveratrol, regardless of climate. Wine prepared from Pinot noir grapes averages 5.13 mg resveratrol per liter ( 2030 , 15154 ). Other red wines, including Cabernet Sauvignon, produced in cold, humid climates, such as Bordeaux and Canada, have higher trans-resveratrol content than those produced in hot, dry climates ( 2030 ). Resveratrol is not found in significant quantities in fermented grape beverages that are stored in oak barrels, such as cognac ( 7864 ). Anti-colitis effects In animal models of colitis, resveratrol reduces colonic damage and decreases inflammation by reducing neutrophil infiltration, cytokine levels, and inflammatory prostaglandins. Resveratrol also appears to enhance colonic cell apoptosis ( 15141 ). Anti-inflammatory effects Resveratrol has anti-inflammatory activity, likely due to inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2, hydroperoxidases, and 5-lipoxygenase ( 2030 , 2948 , 12482 , 12484 , 56943 ). In vitro, resveratrol may be more selective for COX-1 as it appears to inactivate COX-1, but only weakly inhibits COX-2 based on some research ( 15140 , 15148 ). However, some evidence does suggest that resveratrol inhibits COX-2 ( 70815 , 70816 ). Some evidence suggests that resveratrol is a more potent anti-inflammatory agent than NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or indomethacin ( 12483 , 15154 ). In animal models, intra-articular injections and doses of resveratrol decrease inflammation and reduce cartilage destruction ( 15095 , 71081 ). Resveratrol also seems to decrease the activity of inflammatory cytokines ( 6126 ). Resveratrol reduces interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-8, and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) released from alveolar macrophages isolated from smokers ( 15155 ). This suggests that resveratrol might have a role in reducing inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although some results from individual clinical trials disagree ( 95828 ), clinical research from meta-analyses shows that resveratrol reduces inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha ( 105182 , 105184 , 109602 , 109168 , 114526 ). However, meta-analyses show that resveratrol does not reduce levels of the inflammatory marker IL-6 ( 109168 , 114526 ). Antiaging effects Research in animals on a high-calorie diet shows that resveratrol can increase lifespan and improve other factors associated with a longer lifespan including increasing insulin sensitivity and decreasing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) ( 15093 ). Laboratory research suggests that the anti-aging effects of resveratrol may be partly due to the activation of enzymes involved in slowing the pace of aging. This enzyme activation may be similar to the anti-aging effects of caloric restriction ( 70916 , 70942 , 70980 , 71005 ). Resveratrol and calorie restriction also activate sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that improves mitochondrial function and increases cellular antioxidant capacity, leading to improved cardiovascular function and possible antiaging effects ( 112944 ). Anticancer effects There is interest in resveratrol for preventing cancer and improving mortality. Trans-resveratrol has antimutagenic activity ( 2948 , 15144 ). Preliminary research in animal models suggests resveratrol might reduce the risk of cancer. It seems to inhibit tumor growth, promote apoptosis, and delay metastasis ( 2948 , 2958 , 2959 , 12482 , 70961 ). The effect of resveratrol on cellular apoptosis differs depending on conditions. In some cases, it facilitates apoptosis and in others it inhibits apoptosis. In vitro, low concentrations of resveratrol inhibit hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis of human leukemia cells ( 15143 ). Also, resveratrol inhibits growth and induces cell death of ovarian cancer cell lines. However, cell death appears to be mediated through autophagocytic processes rather than apoptosis ( 15147 ). Resveratrol also inhibits growth and induces apoptotic cell death of breast cancer cell lines, medulloblastoma cell lines, and other cell lines in vitro ( 7861 , 15149 , 15156 , 15157 , 15164 , 71119 , 70903 , 70915 , 70917 , 71120 ). However, in an animal model, adding resveratrol to the diet does not decrease intestinal tumor load as measured by COX-2 expression ( 15150 ). Preliminary data also suggests that resveratrol may prevent liver cancer cells from invading local tissues ( 7862 ). Antidiabetic effects Clinical research shows that resveratrol may reduce blood glucose and HbA1c, and improve insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 71066 , 71097 , 91329 , 105183 ). However, it does not appear to improve beta-cell function ( 71066 ). Some clinical evidence has attributed the antidiabetic effects of resveratrol to its ability to decrease oxidative stress ( 71066 ). Also, animal research suggests that the antidiabetic effects of resveratrol may result from its ability to modulate enzymes involved in inflammation and apoptosis ( 71062 , 71080 ). Antioxidant effects Resveratrol significantly reduces lipid peroxidation and organ damage in animal models of ischemia-reperfusion ( 15144 , 70825 , 70842 , 70996 ). Preliminary research suggests that chronic administration of resveratrol might improve myocardial function in models of myocardial ischemia ( 15096 ). In humans and laboratory research, resveratrol appears to reduce levels of oxidative compounds and protect against oxidation ( 64633 , 70919 , 70941 , 70979 , 71112 ). Laboratory research suggests that resveratrol protects against the oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and DNA ( 70809 , 70832 , 70865 ). Antiplatelet effects Resveratrol seems to have anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects in laboratory research ( 2030 , 2948 , 2949 , 2950 , 2951 , 2952 , 2961 , 15139 , 70813 , 70828 )( 70831 , 70876 , 70892 , 70968 , 71106 ). Antiviral effects Resveratrol inhibits the replication of herpes simplex virus. Although the mechanism of this action is not fully known, exposure to resveratrol within one hour of cellular infection appears to be most effective in arresting viral growth. This suggests that resveratrol reduces production of proteins needed to regulate viral proliferation ( 7866 ). Resveratrol also appears to inhibit the replication of the rhinovirus, the influenza A virus, and the cytomegalovirus ( 70945 , 91336 , 91337 ). Cardioprotective effects There is interest in resveratrol for preventing cardiovascular disease and improving mortality. Trans-resveratrol has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity ( 2948 , 15144 ). Preliminary research suggests that chronic administration of resveratrol might improve myocardial function in models of myocardial ischemia ( 15096 ). In vitro, resveratrol appears to inhibit Chlamydia pneumoniae ( 15151 ). Systemic dissemination of Chlamydia has been suggested as a possible cause of atherosclerosis and heart disease. Some researchers speculate that resveratrol's activity against Chlamydia could explain some of wine's cardiovascular benefits. Other potential cardioprotective effects of resveratrol, as shown in human and laboratory research, have included regulation of vasodilation and vasoconstriction, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and inhibition of platelet aggregation ( 2954 , 70819 , 70973 , 71015 ). Resveratrol has been shown to modulate the activity of endothelial cells and nitric oxide production ( 2030 , 70886 , 71023 , 71033 , 71045 , 71111 ). Also, evidence from human and animal research suggests that resveratrol may reduce blood pressure ( 71085 , 71109 ). Generally, although in vitro and animal data have shown cardioprotective effects, most research in humans shows no benefit of resveratrol on risk factors for cardiovascular disease ( 91330 , 91333 , 95835 ). Cardiovascular effects Resveratrol activates sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase involved in mitochondrial function, increasing its plasma levels, and also decreases plasma noradrenaline levels. Circulating levels of SIRT1 are positively correlated with nitrate-mediated vasodilation in both sexes, and also predict flow-mediated vasodilation in males but not females. Increased SIRT1 levels are associated with improved cardiovascular function ( 112944 ). Dental effects Trans-resveratrol orodispersible tablets increase acid-resistant and antibacterial proteins in the acquired enamel pellicle, which might protect tooth enamel from erosion and dental caries ( 114544 ). Estrogenic effects Resveratrol is a weak phytoestrogen ( 2960 , 15142 ). It binds to both alpha and beta estrogen receptors, but its affinity for these receptors is about 7000 times less than estrogen ( 7865 , 19085 , 70901 ). Trans-resveratrol has mixed agonist and antagonist activity on the estrogen-alpha receptor, whereas cis-resveratrol has significantly less activity at the estrogen receptor ( 15146 , 70858 , 70863 ). Resveratrol has been studied for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Preliminary clinical research shows that taking resveratrol (RevGenetics) 1,500 mg daily for 3 months decreases levels of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone but not insulin levels or sensitivity compared to placebo in women with PCOS ( 95823 ). Resveratrol has been also assessed for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Risk factors of BPH include family history, obesity, and lack of physical activity. Clinical research shows that taking trans-resveratrol 150 mg or 1,000 mg daily for 4 months does not affect prostate volume, prostate specific antigen (PSA), or testosterone levels compared to placebo in middle-aged men with metabolic syndrome. The higher dose of resveratrol did lower dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione levels possibly due to resveratrol's weak phytoestrogenic effects ( 95829 ). Hepatoprotective effects In humans with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatoprotective effects of resveratrol may have been related to reduced levels of inflammatory markers and apoptosis of liver cells ( 91328 ). Resveratrol also appears to decrease mortality in animal models of alcohol-related liver damage ( 15094 ). In a separate model, resveratrol appears to reduce hepatic injury associated with trauma hemorrhage; mechanisms of action may have involved the estrogen receptor and reduced inflammatory mediators ( 70983 ). Immunologic effects Resveratrol appears to have immunomodulatory activity. But the effects seem to differ in vitro compared to in vivo. In vitro, resveratrol appears to suppress T cell proliferation. In vivo, using animal models, resveratrol does not appear to have this effect, or affect blood cell counts or other measures of immune system activity ( 15152 ). At least in vitro, the effects of resveratrol on T cell proliferation may also be due to dose. While low-dose resveratrol stimulated the production of specific T cells, this was inhibited with high concentrations ( 70866 ). Lipid effects In animal research, resveratrol appears to improve abnormal lipid profiles ( 71062 ). Resveratrol inhibits formation of cholesterol in certain strains of bacteria ( 7863 ), but it is not known if this contributes significantly to cholesterol lowering in humans or animals. Some data suggest it does not. Clinical research in healthy humans shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg orally daily for 30 days increases levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B ( 112944 ). Neuroprotective effects Resveratrol is of interest in preventing and treating Alzheimer disease. In vitro, resveratrol prevents beta-amyloid peptide-related reductions in glutathione. This suggests that resveratrol might prevent oxidative damage caused by beta-amyloid (Ab) peptide ( 15153 ). Resveratrol appears to also block amyloid beta-aggregation ( 71031 ). Resveratrol has been assessed for its effects on purported markers of Alzheimer disease such as tau and Ab40 proteins. Clinical research shows that taking encapsulated resveratrol starting at 500 mg daily and increasing by 500 mg daily every 13 weeks for a total of 52 weeks resulted in a greater Ab40 marker concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid but no difference in the markers Ab42, Ab40, Ab42, tau, and phospho-tau 181 compared to placebo in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer disease ( 95833 ). Additionally, clinical research shows that resveratrol increases cerebrospinal fluid and plasma levels of Ab40, but not Ab42. This suggests that resveratrol suppresses neuroinflammatory activity by stabilizing Ab40, making it less likely to aggregate and contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease ( 114517 ). In human research, resveratrol increases cerebral blood flow, as evidenced by increased hemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin ( 71039 ). The potential neuroprotective effects of resveratrol are also thought to be due to improved glucose metabolism, preserved hippocampal volume, and enhanced hippocampal functional connectivity, all of which have been demonstrated in human studies ( 102511 , 102512 ). Resveratrol has also been shown to offer benefits in in vitro and animal models of epilepsy, ischemia, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and nerve injury ( 71004 , 71016 , 71055 ). It is possible that resveratrol protects against neuronal apoptotic cell death by modulating the expression of apoptotic genes or interfering with signaling pathways ( 70844 , 71022 , 71026 ). Laboratory research suggests that the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol may be at least partially due to the modulation of enzymes involved in apoptosis and inflammation ( 71000 , 71032 , 7054 , 71055 ). Pulmonary effects Some preliminary laboratory research suggests that resveratrol may play a role in the reduction of asthma symptoms. In vitro, resveratrol appears to inhibit inflammatory mediators from human airway smooth muscle cells ( 71048 ). Resveratrol also appears to inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators from cells isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ( 15155 ). Renoprotective effects Clinical research shows that taking resveratrol might improve glomerular filtration rate and levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, while in vitro research suggests that resveratrol's renoprotective effects may be due to inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor and preservation of mitochondrial complex III activity, thereby protecting renal mitochondria from oxidative stress ( 112136 ). Weight loss effects Resveratrol appears to have weight loss effects in both clinical and laboratory research. In humans with metabolic syndrome, resveratrol appears to reduce body weight and fat mass ( 91331 ). It has been suggested that resveratrol binds to cannabinoid CB1 receptors in laboratory research ( 71114 ). Laboratory research also suggests that resveratrol may also reduce the production and proliferation of adipocytes or fat cells, and decrease the production of stored fat ( 91338 ). Resveratrol may also mimic caloric restriction in terms of regulating signal transduction pathways and enzyme production ( 91339 ). However, a small clinical trial in healthy adults shows that taking resveratrol 500 mg daily for 30 days does not have a significant effect on body weight or body mass index ( 112944 ).",
